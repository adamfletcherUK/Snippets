",1192,Fry," And that's how you play the game!
",353,Boy," You stink, loser!
",194,Panucci," Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out! C'mon!!
",365,Fry," Michelle, baby! Where you going?
",346,Michelle," It's not working out, Fry.   I put your stuff out on the sidewalk!
",687,Fry," I hate my life, I hate my life, I hate my life.
",498,Bike Thief," Happy new year!
",179,Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for, uh ...  ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! I always thought at this point in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls!  Here's to another lousy millennium.
",18010,Crowd,"  Ten!

",817,Crowd,"  Thathu!
",1018,Crowd,"  Nee!
",719,Crowd,"  One!
",720,Fry," What the--?
",1321,Fry," My God! It's the future. My parents, my co-workers, my girlfriend; I'll never see any of them again. Yahoo!
",10922,Terry,"  Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
",3623,Lou," Why do you always have to say it that way?
",4424,Terry," Haven't you ever heard of a little thing called showmanship?   Come, your destiny awaits!
",9125,Lou," Have a nice future.
",2126,Fry," Cool! Just like in Star Trek!  Ow!
",3627,Leela," Good afternoon, sir.  Name?
",2928,Fry," Uh, Fry.
",1029,Leela," I'm Leela. Now, it's New Year's Eve so I'd like to decide your fate quickly and get out of here.
",9830,Fry," Can I ask you a question?
",2731,Leela," As long as it's not about my eye.
",3532,Fry," Uh...
",733,Leela," Is it about my eye?
",2134,Fry," Sort of.
",1035,Leela," Just ask the question.
",2436,Fry," What's with the eye?
",2237,Leela," I'm an alien, alright? Now let's drop the subject.
",5238,Fry," Cool, an alien! Has your race taken over the Earth?
",5339,Leela," No, I just work here.
",2340,Fry," Wait a minute! Is that blimp accurate?
",4041,Leela," Yep. It's December 31st, 2999.
",3242,Fry," My God! A million years!
",2643,Leela," I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
",4744,Fry," Y'know, I guess it should be but, actually, I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.
",20445,Leela," Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the probulator.
",9646,Leela," Interesting. Your DNA test shows one living relative. He's your great-great-great-great-great-great-great...
",11047,Leela," ...great-great-great-great-great nephew.
",4248,Fry," That's great! What's the little guy's name?
",4549,Leela," Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
",3050,Fry," Eurgh!
",851,Fry," Y'know, I'm the luckiest guy in the whole future. I've been given a second chance and this time I'm not going to be a total loser.  What's that?
",14652,Leela," Your permanent career assignment.
",3553,Fry," Delivery boy? No! Not again! Please! Anything else!
",5354,Leela," Take your hands off me! You've been assigned the job you're best at just like everyone else.
",9455,Fry," What if I refuse?
",1956,Leela," Then you'll be fired--
",2457,Fry," Fine!
",758,Leela," Out of a cannon into the Sun!
",3159,Fry," But I don't like being a delivery boy.
",4060,Leela," Well that's tough! Lots of people don't like their jobs but we do them anyway.  You gotta do what you gotta do. Now hold out your hand. I'm gonna implant your career chip. It'll permanently label you as a delivery boy.
",22061,Fry," Keep that thing away from me!
",3162,Leela," Hold still, dammit. I don't have good depth perception!  You've got until the count of five to let me out of here. One--
",12263,Fry," See you in a thousand years!  You owe me one.
",4764,Fry," Whoa!
",765,Man #1," JFK Jr. Airport.
",1866,Man #1," Radio City Mutant Hall.
",2567,Fry," Cool!  Um. Cross Town Express?
",3268,Man #1 #2," Pft! Tourist!
",1569,Fry," Hey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew.  Wow! A real live robot! Or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
",11970,Bender," Bite my shiny metal ass.
",2671,Fry," It doesn't look so shiny to me.
",3372,Bender," Shinier than yours, meatbag!
",3073,Bender," Listen, buddy, I'm in a hurry here. Let's try for a two-fer!
",6274,Booth Voice," Please select mode of death: ""Quick and Painless"" or ""Slow and Horrible"".
",7575,Fry," Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call.
",4176,Booth Voice," You have selected: ""Slow and Horrible"".
",4177,Bender," Great choice!  Bring it on, baby!
",3578,Bender," C'mon, c'mon! Kill me already! By the way, my name's Bender!
",6279,Fry," Help! What's happening?
",2580,Booth Voice," You are now dead. Thank you for using Stop-N-Drop, America's favourite suicide booth since 2008.
",9881,Bender," Lousy, stinking rip-off!  Well, I didn't have anything else planned for today. Let's go get drunk!
",10082,Leela," Two, three-- Hey!
",1983,Terry,"  Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
",3684,Leela," Shut up, Terry.
",1785,Ipgee," This is unacceptable, Leela. You must find this Mr. Fry and install his chip.
",7986,Leela," Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him.
",10487,Ipgee," Well that's your job, whether you like it or not. And it's my job to make you do your job whether I like it or not, which I do, very much! Now get to work!  Life is good!
",17288,Fry," Why would a robot need to drink?
",3489,Bender," I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want!  So they made you a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job.
",12090,Fry," Really? What do you do, Bender?
",3391,Bender," I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.
",6492,Fry," You any good at it?
",2193,Bender," You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle: 30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it!  31.  But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for.
",17994,Fry," What?
",795,Bender," Suicide booths!  Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you. I'm gonna go kill myself.
",8696,Fry," Wait! You're the only friend I have!
",3897,Bender," You really want a robot for a friend?
",3998,Fry," Yeah, ever since I was six.
",2999,Bender," Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals. So, if anyone asks, you're my debugger.
",104100,Fry," Oh, no, it's the Cyclops!  Don't look! Don't look!
",52101,Bender," I'm not looking!
",18102,Leela," This is officer 1B-DI requesting back-up.
",43103,Smitty," We'll be there in five minutes.
",33104,Bender," We can hide in here. It's free on Tuesdays!
",45105,Nimoy," Welcome to the Head Museum. I'm Leonard Nimoy.
",48106,Fry," Spock? Hey! Hey... Do the thing!
",34107,Nimoy," I don't do that anymore.
",26108,Fry," This is unbelievable! What do you heads do all day?
",53109,Nimoy," We share our wisdom with those who seek it. It's a life of quiet dignity.
",75110,Woman #1," Feeding time!
",15111,Leela," Hmm.  I'm sorry, Fry, but I have to install your career chip.
",63112,Fry," Yeah, well, if you're sorry why are you doing it?
",51113,Leela," It's my job. You gotta do what you gotta do!  Watch it!
",57114,Nixon," That's it! You just made my list!
",35115,Fry," Ow! Stop it! Down, boy! Bad president!
",40116,Smitty," Alright, buddy, step away from the head!
",42117,URL," I'm gonna get 24th century on his ass!
",40118,Leela," Please, officers, there's no need to use force.
",49119,URL," Let us handle this, weird-y.
",30120,Leela," Oh, come on, he's just a poor kid from the Stupid Ages.
",57121,Smitty," Keep your big nose out of this, eyeball!
",42122,Leela," No-one makes fun of my nose.
",30123,URL," Damn!
",7124,Leela," You guys were totally out of control.
",39125,Smitty," It's our job. We're peace officers.
",37126,URL," Yeah, you know the law: You gotta do what you gotta do.
",57127,Bender," Oh, we're trapped!
",20128,Fry," Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars.
",90129,Bender," Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?
",111130,Fry," Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
",103131,Bender," I'll have to check my program ... yep.
",40132,Leela,"  Open up!
",11133,Fry," C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals ... and animal robots.
",143134,Bender," You're full of crap, Fry!  You make a persuasive argument, Fry.
",65135,Fry," Come on, Bender! You can do it.
",33136,Bender," Can't ... I ... can't ... do ... it!
",38137,Fry," Yes!
",6138,Bender," You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when I want, who I want! I'm unstoppable!
",107139,Fry," I don't know how you did that.
",32140,Leela," Wait!
",7141,Bender,"  No, thanks.
",14142,Bender," Looks like one of us will have to bend this grate.
",52143,Fry," Good Lord! What is this?
",26144,Bender," It's the decaying ruins of Old New York. Welcome home, pal!
",61145,Fry," It's my old neighbourhood. Man, this brings back a lot of memories.
",69146,Bender," Keep 'em to yourself, Pops!
",29147,Fry," This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
",63148,Fry," My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
",66149,Bender," Wait! There's someone you know!
",33150,Fry," Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already.
",61151,Leela," Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel.
",71152,Fry," No, you don't. I've got no home, no family--
",46153,Bender," No friends.
",13154,Fry," My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.
",90155,Leela," I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.
",187156,Fry," Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it.  Your chip. What are you doing?
",172157,Leela," Quitting.
",11158,Fry," Why?
",6159,Leela," Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.
",75160,Fry," What is the matter with you?
",30161,Bender," I just wanted to be part of the moment.
",41162,Leela," Hey! He stole my ring!
",24163,Bender," Sorry.  Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink.
",84164,Leela," I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed and we have nowhere to go.
",108165,Fry," Correction: We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to mooch off of.
",84166,Clark,"  Hello, I'm Dick Clark's head. Welcome to a special year 3000 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve!
",98167,Farnsworth," Who are you?
",14168,Fry," I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.
",30169,Farnsworth," I don't have an Uncle Fry.
",28170,Bender," You do now!
",13171,Farnsworth," By God, I am your nephew! This is absolutely incredible!
",58172,Bender," Can we have some money?
",25173,Farnsworth," Oh, my, no.
",13174,Farnsworth," Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool. And over there is my intergalactic spaceship!  And here's where I keep assorted lengths of wire.
",169175,Fry," Whoa! A real live spaceship!
",30176,Farnsworth," I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.
",85177,Smitty,"  Attention, job deserters! Come out with your hands up. We have you partially surrounded.
",91178,Fry," No!
",5179,Nixon," Get those bums!
",17180,Bender," Well, we're boned!
",20181,Leela," Can't we get away in the ship?
",32182,Farnsworth," I suppose it is technically possible. Though I am already in my pyjamas.
",74183,Fry," I'll get us out of here.
",26184,Farnsworth," Can anyone drive stick?
",25185,Leela," I can. As long as I don't have to parallel park.
",50186,URL," If they try to take off, give 'em an ass-ful of laser.
",56187,Leela," Prepare for lift-off. Ten.
",28188,Crowd,"  Nine!
",8189,Crowd,"  Amania!
",10190,Crowd,"  Seven!
",9191,Aliens,"  Six.
",7192,Terry,"  Five!
",8193,Nimoy," Four.
",7194,Farnsworth," Three.
",8195,Bender," Two.
",6196,Leela," One!
",6197,Fry," Blast-off!
",12198,Nixon," Fire! Fire!
",13199,Smitty," I can't see nothing. Pretty though!
",37200,Fry," So, I guess, without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever.
",56201,Farnsworth," Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship crew?
",94202,Bender," New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
",44203,Farnsworth," Of those poor sons of-- But that's not important. The important thing is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?
",112204,Fry," Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!
",54205,Leela," Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips.
",77206,Farnsworth," Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it, I saved the chips from my previous crew.
",94207,Fry," This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?
",102208,Farnsworth," If by that you mean ""transporting cargo"" then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research.
",111209,Fry," Cool! What's my job gonna be?
",31210,Farnsworth," You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.
",78211,Fry," So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?
",34212,Farnsworth," Exactly!
",10213,Fry," Alright! I'm a delivery boy!
",30214,Farnsworth," As new employees, I'd like your opinion on our commercial. I paid to have it air during the Super Bowl.
",105215,Fry," Wow!
",6216,Farnsworth," Not on the same channel, of course.
",37217,Announcer #1,"  Interplanetary deliveries - what a headache!
",47218,H.G. Blob,"  Evans! Where's that package from Earth?
",42219,Man #1,"  Uh...   I'm not Evans!
",25220,H.G. Blob,"  He should've used Planet Express!
",36221,Announcer #1,"  When those other companies aren't brave or foolhardy enough to go, trust Planet Express for reliable, on time delivery.
",122222,Evans,"  Here's your package, Mr. Horrible Gelatinous Blob.
",53223,H.G. Blob,"  Good work, Evans! You've got a future around here.
",53224,Evans,"  Thank you, sir!
",18225,Announcer #1,"  Planet Express: Our crew is replaceable. Your package isn't.
",63226,Fry," Are there really giant birds like that?
",41227,Farnsworth," No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone likes eggs.
",98228,Fry," I'm never going to get used to the 31st century.  Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?
",107229,Leela," Well, if you don't like that, try some Archduke Chocula.
",58230,Farnsworth," Ah, Hermes! Crew, meet Hermes Conrad. He manages my delivery business, pays the bills, notifies next of kin, what have you.
",125231,Hermes," Someone come and dropped this package through the slot last night. Now which one of you is the captain?
",105232,Farnsworth," Oh, my! I haven't picked a new captain yet. It's always so hard to choose.
",76233,Fry," Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!
",21234,Farnsworth," Hmm, you!
",11235,Hermes," OK, Captain, this is just a standard legal release protecting Planet Express from lawsuits in the event of the unforeseen.
",124236,Leela,"  Death by airlock failure.
",28237,Hermes," Mm.
",5238,Leela,"  Death by brain parasite.
",27239,Hermes," Yeah.
",7240,Leela,"  Death by sonic diarrhoea?
",28241,Hermes,"  Oh, you don't want that!
",27242,Leela," Look, I don't know about any of your previous captains but I intend to do as little dying as possible.
",104243,Hermes," Sign the paper!
",17244,Farnsworth," Now, Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor. I should warn you though, he's a little ... unusual.  He wears sandals!
",145245,Fry," Hi--
",6246,Farnsworth," Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery boy. He needs a physical.
",71247,Zoidberg," Excellent, excellent!
",23248,Farnsworth," You'll be fine.
",17249,Zoidberg," Now open your mouth and let's have a look at that brain.  No, no, no, no, no, not that mouth!
",95250,Fry," I only have one.
",18251,Zoidberg," Really?
",9252,Fry," Uh, is there a human doctor around?
",37253,Zoidberg," Young lady, I'm an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say...  What? My mother was a saint! Get out!
",114254,Farnsworth," Dear Lord, Bender, you're filthy.
",35255,Bender," Yeah, like you don't have crap in your neck!
",46256,Farnsworth," Amy, why don't you give his body a going over with the cleaning pick?
",71257,Amy," OK. Does it hurt when I go like this?
",39258,Leela," Ow!
",5259,Bender," A little.
",11260,Fry," Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?
",74261,Farnsworth," As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy Wong. She's an engineering student of mine.  I like having her around because she's the same blood type as me.
",187262,Amy," Hey! You're the unfrozen guy! From the 20th century, right?
",61263,Fry,"  Last time I checked.
",23264,Leela," Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?
",39265,Amy," Look, we're not as rich as everybody says.
",44266,Leela," Uh-huh! What sorority do you belong to?
",41267,Amy,"  Kappa Kappa Wong.
",20268,Bender," Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining.   Look at my head. It's all painted! Look at my head! I got a big, old head, hey! Ho!   Alright, show's over, I'm tired.
",195269,Farnsworth," Ah, to be young again. And also a robot. Now, as I recall, you youngsters have a package to deliver.
",102270,Fry," Finally! Come on, Bender. Let's mosey!
",40271,Bender," Nice catch, idiot!
",20272,Fry," So where are we going anyway?
",31273,Leela," Nowhere special. The moon.
",28274,Fry," The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!
",132275,Amy," Oh, I love stuff like the moon! Can I come, Leela?
",52276,Leela," Well ... I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screw-ups until at least my second day as captain.
",121277,Farnsworth," Nothing will go wrong.   If something goes wrong, bring back the blood.
",73278,Fry," Can I do the countdown?
",25279,Leela," Huh? Oh, sure. Knock yourself out.
",36280,Fry," Ten ...  ... nine--
",21281,Leela," OK, we're here!
",17282,Fry,"  Eightsevensixfivefourthreetwooneblastoff!
",44283,Fry," Hurry up! I wanna see the moon!
",33284,Leela," Relax. It's open till 9.
",26285,Fry," That's one small step for Fry--
",33286,Man #1," And one giant line for admission!
",35287,Fry," Wow!  Um, can I have cuts?
",28288,Man #1," Hmm ... no!
",13289,Fry," You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!
",78290,Amy," Guh! It's the happiest place orbiting Earth.
",46291,Fry," Let's go, already!
",20292,Leela," Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
",34293,Fry," Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
",58294,Bender," Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
",65295,Leela," OK, if everyone's finished being stupid--
",43296,Fry," I had more but you go ahead.
",30297,Leela," We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.
",69298,Fry," But I've never been to the moon before.
",41299,Leela," Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals ... and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.  Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate. Then lock up when you're done. Just be careful.
",197300,Amy," Aye, aye, Captain! I mean only one eye. I mean, yes, sir-- Um, ma'am!
",71301,Amy," Clear?
",8302,Fry," Clear!
",8303,Amy," Ready to hoist?
",17304,Fry," Ready!
",8305,Amy," Ow!
",5306,Fry," My first space delivery.
",26307,Fry," Uh, greetings, Moon Man. We come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth.
",76308,Sal," Wise guy, huh? If I wasn't so lazy I'd punch you in the stomach.
",66309,Fry," But you are lazy, right?
",26310,Sal," Oh, don't get me started.
",27311,Craterface," Hi, I'm Craterface! Welcome to Luna Park. I'll have to confiscate your alcohol, sir.
",86312,Bender," Better mascots than you have tried.
",37313,Craterface," At least I still have my self respect!
",40314,Leela," Who buys this trash?
",22315,Bender," Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.
",41316,Fry," Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets.
",43317,Bender," Get it off! Get it off! Get it-- Uh-oh!   How many roads must a man walk down, before you--   Keep those things off of me! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit!
",161318,Fry," So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?
",63319,Bender," Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna be a folk singer.
",72320,Whalerbots,"  We're whalers on the moon,
We carry a harpoon,
But there ain't no whales,
So we tell our tall tale,
And sing our whaling tune!
",129321,Whalerbot," Bender, hey, Bender! Over here!
",33322,Bender," Oh, jeez! I went to high school with that guy!
",48323,Announcer #1," Monsanto presents: The Goophy Gopher Revue!
",45324,Gopher #1," Why does a moon rock taste better than an Earth rock?
",55325,Gopher #2," Because it's a little meteor!
",31326,Fry," This is weak!
",15327,Gopher #1," Address all complaints to the Monsanto corporation.
",53328,Leela," What's wrong, Fry?
",20329,Fry," I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial. The gravity, the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth.  That's what I came to see! I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut. Screw this phoney stuff!
",248330,Leela," But the phoney stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there.
",60331,Bender," Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to see the Sexeteria!
",90332,Leela," Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space suit and drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.
",158333,Fry," I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!
",50334,Bender,"  Next year in Jerusalem!
",26335,Fry," Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.
",50336,Narrator,"  The story of lunar exploration started with one man. A man with a dream.
",75337,Ralph Kramden-bot," One of these days, Alice. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon!
",61338,Leela," Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!
",57339,Fry," That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.
",117340,Amy," Wow! I could swear I was really playing virtual skeeball!  Hm?
",64341,Bender," Look, it's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer.
",57342,Amy," The keys to the ship!  They must have fallen into the crate! Leela's gonna kill me!
",85343,Bender," Nah. She'll probably make me do it.
",37344,Amy," Mister? Could you please get those keys out for me?
",53345,Sal," What do I look like? A guy who's not lazy?
",44346,Narrator,"  No one knows where, when or how Man first landed on the moon.
",64347,Fry," I do.
",7348,Narrator,"  But our fun-gineers think it might have happened something like this:
",72349,Whalerbots,"  We're whalers on the moon,
",29350,Gophers,"  We carry a harpoon,
",22351,Whalerbots," and   But there ain't no whales so we tell a tall tale...
",59352,Leela,"  And sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon--
",55353,Fry," That's not how it happened.
",29354,Leela," Oh, really? I don't see you with a fun-gineering degree!
",58355,Fry," This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.
",61356,Leela," Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides, the car's on a track.
",111357,Fry," Not for long!
",15358,Whalerbot," Ooh! Ah! I died doin' what I loved.
",37359,Leela," OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?
",138360,Fry," Agreed.  Yeah! Crank up the radio!
",36361,Whalerbots,"  We're whalers on the--
",25362,Fry," Yee-haw!
",10363,Leela," Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.
",46364,Fry," No, not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?
",71365,Leela," That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!
",45366,Fry," Well I'm feelin' lucky!  Uh ... I'm ready to go back now.
",59367,Fry," We're gonna die! It's every man for himself!  Help me, Leela!  You did it! We're safe!
",88368,Leela," No. Now we're gonna die.
",26369,Fry," It's every man for himself.
",29370,Bender," Hey, look what I won from a tourist's pocket!
",47371,Amy," Shut up. You're distracting me.
",33372,Bender," Come on, it's just like making love. Y'know: Left, down, rotate 62 degrees, engage rotor.
",91373,Amy," I know how to make love!
",26374,Bender," Here, let me do it.  Ah, lousy arm. Must be rigged!  That's her, officers!  Uh, that's the woman who programmed me for evil!
",126375,Bender," Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!
",105376,Fry,"  I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that barn over there.
",93377,Leela," Thank God!
",12378,Hydroponic Farmer," Trespassers, eh?
",18379,Fry," No, sir. We're amusement park patrons.
",40380,Farmer," Ooh, that's a wicked sinful place. Tilt-a-whirl's OK, but the rest is mighty wicked.
",86381,Leela," Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?
",65382,Farmer," Huh, borry? Looky here, city girl, oxygen don't grow on trees. You'll have to earn it doing chores on my hydroponic farm. You can go back to your precious theme park at sun up.
",178383,Fry," I guess we could do chores for a few hours.
",45384,Leela," Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon.
",41385,Farmer," Yup. Drops down to -173!
",26386,Fry," Fahrenheit or Celsius?
",24387,Farmer," First one, then th'other. And them spacesuits ain't a-heated so you ain't goin' nowhere till sunrise. You can sleep in the barn. Just don't be a-touchin' my three beautiful robot daughters. Y'hear?
",199388,Fry," Robot daughters?
",18389,Farmer," This here is Lulabelle 7.
",27390,Lulabelle 7," Yoo-hoo!
",10391,Farmer," Daisy-Mae 128K.
",17392,Daisy-Mae K," Yoo-hoo!
",10393,Farmer," And the Crushinator.
",22394,Crushinator,"  Yoo-hoo.
",11395,Fry," Whoa!
",7396,Leela," I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too phoney. We had to see the real moon.
",118397,Fry," And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and ... and these fellas.
",132398,Leela," Fry, face it: The moon is a dump. It's a boring, dried-up wasteland and the only reason anybody ever comes here is for the tacky little amusement park. Can't you just accept that?
",181399,Fry," I guess I can't.
",18400,Farmer," I'll learn ye to sleep with my robot daughters!
",49401,Bender," He'll never find me in here.
",30402,Leela," Bender?
",9403,Fry," Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?
",56404,Bender," Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.
",58405,Farmer," Oh, no you don't! C'mere, Crushinator.
",40406,Crushinator,"  Yes, Pa.
",11407,Fry," It's too low.
",15408,Leela," Hang on. Hang on. Jump!  Hold on to your helmet!
",50409,Farmer," God darn it, Crushinator, jump!
",33410,Crushinator,"  No, Pa. I love him.
",22411,Fry," Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!
",35412,Leela," Nightfall's coming.  Hurry, before we freeze.
",47413,Bender," What do you mean ""we"", mammal?
",32414,Farnsworth," Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas.
",75415,Leela," We can't outrun it forever.
",29416,Fry," Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!
",60417,Leela," Quick, get in.
",16418,Fry," It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint!  Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?
",137419,Leela," Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks in the dust.  Now get in here before you freeze.
",124420,Bender," Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole thing.
",178421,Leela," Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.
",76422,Fry," Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here.
",67423,Leela," That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is.
",81424,Fry," I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.
",241425,Leela," A week would be a little much.
",32426,Fry," The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to.  But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to.
",299427,Leela," Fry, look. . It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before.
",79428,Farmer," Had to come back for the Crushinator, eh, robot? Well I got you this time.
",76429,Fry," It's Amy! We're saved!
",24430,Leela," Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?
",59431,Bender," Not the magnet! No! No! No--  Uh-oh!
",38432,Bender,"  She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes,
She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes--
 I'll kill you Amy!
 She'll be comin' round the mountain,
She'll be comin' round the mountain,
She'll be comin'--
",221433,Farmer," Aw, dang it!
",14434,Bender,"  She'll be riding six white horses when she comes,
She'll be riding six white horses when she comes--
 Hey, I'm pretty good!
 She'll be riding six white horses...
",164435,Leela,"  So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?
",77436,Fry,"  Well ... close enough!
",25437,Bender,"  Well I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,
Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,
Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun,
Oh, I'll shoot her with my ray gun,
Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,
When she comes!
I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world,
I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world, 
I'll be blastin' all the humans, 
I'll be blastin' all the humans, 
I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world,
In the world!
 One more time!
",484438,Bender," Hey!
",6439,Hermes," Fry, mon, if you're going to be living in the office you could at least be on time for work.
",94440,Fry," I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.
",64441,Hermes," Alright, people. I will now outline today's 12-point agenda. We'll begin with point one, then race forward--
",110442,Hermes," Concerning our pest problem: Somebody's been leaving food around and it's attracting owls. And I, for one, am getting tired of cleaning those owl traps.  Now...  As this shocking graph indicates, our water consumption has tripled in the last month. I notice Fry has been here for a month, so I'm appointing him head of a committee to find who's responsible. Fry?  Am I cracking up, or is Fry's living here starting to get in the way of bus--
",443443,Leela," What the hell are you doing? You're getting a huge dose of radiation!
",71444,Fry,"  And great lift!
",18445,Leela," Do you know how long it's going to take me to recalibrate these engines?
",74446,Fry," Hey! When you look this good, you don't have to know anything.
",64447,Leela," Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry.
",46448,Bender," That's right, we want some moneyâ€” Wait. What's this about Fry?
",64449,Leela," He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.
",68450,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy.  This sarcophagus should contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zuban 5 over 29 million years ago.
",232451,Fry," Hey, Professor, great jerky!
",30452,Farnsworth," My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy! Fry has got to go!
",79453,Announcer #1,"  Bachelor Chow, now with flavour!
",35454,Commentator,"  And Bigfoot is down!
",23455,Fry," Sheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 have anything good on.
",61456,Announcer #1,"  All My Circuits is brought to you by Robo Fresh: Designed by a robot, for a robot.
",85457,Calculon,"  I've been processing this for some time, Monique, and, well, will you marry me?
",82458,Monique,"  Oh, Calculon!  It fits! Then you must know that I'm--
",56459,Calculon,"  Metric? I've always known. But for you, my darling, I'm willing to convert.
",78460,Fry," Hmm, must be a friend of theirs.
",34461,Bender," Fry, we've got to discuss your living arrangements.
",53462,Leela," We've all talked it over and--
",32463,Bender," Hey, All My Circuits! Move over.
",34464,Leela," Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without realising it.
",88465,Fry," I know but I forgive you.
",27466,Leela," No, Fry, by ""close quarters"" I mean this office--
",51467,Fry," Uh-huh.
",9468,Leela," And by ""people"" I mean you!
",29469,Fry," Right.
",8470,Leela," And by ""inconsiderate"" I mean--
",33471,Fry," Leela! We're trying to watch TV.
",34472,Bender," Yeah. Would you kindly shut your noise hole?
",46473,Fry," So, who's that weird-looking guy?
",35474,Bender," That's a human.
",17475,Fry," What's he do?
",15476,Bender," Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves.
",60477,Fry," Boring!
",9478,Human Friend,"  Calculon? I thought you were in a coma.
",42479,Calculon,"  That's what I wanted you to think with your soft, human brain.
",65480,Fry," Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?
",41481,Hermes," We'll bill you for the couch.
",31482,Bender," Cheer up, meatbag. You've barely touched your amoeba.
",55483,Fry," It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?
",64484,Bender," Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol.  The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged.
",134485,Fry," What are the cigars for?
",26486,Bender," They make me look cool.
",25487,Fry," I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.
",90488,Bender," Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk.  That's my philosophy. So, where you gonna stay?
",100489,Fry," I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?
",63490,Bender," Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?
",78491,Fry," Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?
",56492,Bender," Nah, I've always wanted a pet.
",32493,Bender," Here we are. Your new home.
",29494,Fry," Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before.
",64495,Bender," Come on in, I'll give you the tour!
",37496,Bender," Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's the breakfast nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because, until now, it's just been wasted space.
",195497,Fry," It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.
",72498,Bender," Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night.
",121499,Fry," Wait, Bender. Bender?
",23500,Bender,"  Kill all humans ... kill all humans ... must kill all the humans.
",68501,Fry," Bender, wake up!
",18502,Bender," I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
",64503,Fry," Uh, listen, Bender. Uh, where's your bathroom?
",48504,Bender," Bath what?
",12505,Fry," Bathroom.
",11506,Bender," What room?
",12507,Fry," Bathroom!
",11508,Bender," What what?
",12509,Fry," Ah, never mind!
",17510,Bender,"  Hey, sexy mama, wanna kill all the humans?
",45511,Leela," We sure are cheerful this morning.
",36512,Bender," Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.
",134513,Leela," What happened to you?
",23514,Fry," Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle?  Now you're OK.
",163515,Leela," Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to live.
",75516,Fry,"  Is that an invitation?
",25517,Leela," Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're moving out.
",86518,Fry," Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him.
",75519,Bender," Hey, there's my little space heater.
",38520,Fry," Well, I'm moving out!
",23521,Bender," What?
",7522,Fry," I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room.
",54523,Bender," Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5 cubic metres. We've got room for a-whole-nother two-thirds of a person.
",143524,Leela," What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?
",63525,Bender," I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place.  And now they're gone.
",88526,Underwater House Salesman," Sure, it ain't one of them la-de-da above-ground places. But if you like dank, hey, forget about it!
",102527,Leela," At least it's got a great view.
",33528,Bender," What the--?
",13529,Underwater House Salesman #1," Excuse me. I gotta go change a lightbulb.
",43530,Leela," Wow! Now this is fantastic!
",29531,Fry," Hmm. I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use.
",74532,Fry," Well, I give up. What's the catch?
",36533,Suspiciously fantastic apartment salesman," Oh, no catch. Although we 'are technically in New Jersey.
",59534,Fry," Not one place even remotely liveable.
",39535,Farnsworth," Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? To shreds, you say. Very well then.  Sad, sad, terrible, gruesome news about my colleague, Dr. Mbutu.
",204536,Leela," Was his apartment rent-controlled?
",36537,Leela," Wow. This is beautiful.
",25538,Bender," What's with all the crap?
",27539,Leela," It's not crap.
",16540,Hattie McDoogal," Dr. Mbutu collected this crap while he was exploring the watcha-call-it ... universe!
",87541,Fry," Well, this place has everything except the only thing I care about: A TV.
",75542,Hattie McDoogal," It's got a TV, you young watcha-call-it ... idiot!
",52543,Fry," Ooh!
",6544,Bender," Whoa, slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't ... cosy.  Ah. I can barely move!   It's perfect!
",122545,Fry," Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel like I'm home.
",86546,Bender," Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know, Fry, of all the friends I've had, you're the first.
",97547,Hermes," Hey, mon!
",11548,Leela," Happy housewarming, Fry!  It's a miniature fruit salad tree.
",62549,Fry," Ooh!  Hey, Amy!
",17550,Amy," Hey!
",6551,Farnsworth," This is for you, Fry  Zevulon the Great. He's teriyaki style.
",63552,Bender," Wow! Heavy-drinking crowd!  I'd better go out for more beer.
",62553,Fry," Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!
",50554,Bender," I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding doesn't go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained.
",144555,Fry," Hey!
",6556,Hermes," These are mighty tasty!
",25557,Zoidberg," Thank you. I made them myself.
",32558,Fry," Sh! The wedding's about to start!
",35559,Preacherbot,"  If anyone here objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold theirâ€”
",82560,Fry," Is he objecting or backing up?
",32561,Amy," Looks like both.
",18562,Calculon,"  I'm afraid my half-brother is correct. You see, I have a terrible secret and that secret is--
",96563,Amy," Oh, this isn't right.
",23564,Hermes," Oh, come on!
",14565,Farnsworth," Fix it!
",9566,Bender," Hey, what happened to the TV?
",31567,Fry," It just went out.
",19568,Bender," This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!
",55569,Hermes," Alright!
",10570,Fry,"  Come back, Bender! It's working!
",35571,Calculon,"  To reiterate, my terrible secret is--
",40572,Fry," It's out again.
",17573,Bender," What? That's the last straw!
",30574,Fry," It's back on!
",15575,Hattie McDoogal," Pardon me. I don't mean to pry into what you're doing in here with the crab and the one-eyed lady and the Chinese girl but everyone on this floor is having trouble with their TV reception.
",190576,Bender," Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta this dump!
",83577,Hattie McDoogal," Relax, sonny. This kajigger'll find the source of the interference.
",69578,Tenant #1," What's going on?
",18579,Tenant #2," We want our TV back!
",22580,Hattie McDoogal," There's your problem.
",23581,Amy," Oh, my God! Bender, it's your thingy!
",39582,Randy," Then get rid of it!
",21583,Tenant #1," Get out!
",10584,Bender," You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.
",66585,Leela," You had cable. This is satellite.
",35586,Farnsworth," Obviously your thoughts are being transmitted on the same frequency.
",70587,Huge-assed woman," They're on my cell phone too.
",31588,Bender," Madam, I believe you're mistaken!
",35589,Bender,"  Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!
",35590,Bender," Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat ass!
",44591,Randy," The robot has to go!
",22592,Tenant #1," Yeah.
",7593,Tenant #3," Get him out of here!
",22594,Hattie McDoogal," Well, you heard the mob!
",26595,Bender," Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You liked that one, right?
",104596,Fry," It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here.
",63597,Bender," Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!
",86598,Fry," Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?
",87599,Bender," I don't understand.
",21600,Fry," Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?
",100601,Bender," But, then we wouldn't be roommates.
",37602,Fry," I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.
",54603,Hattie McDoogal," No he can't.
",14604,Fry," Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy.
",64605,Bender,"  Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy.
",44606,Randy," Hey, the TV's back on!
",24607,Preacherbot,"  We are gathered here to mourn the death of Calculon; industrialist, private eye, friend.
",91608,Calculon,"  Mind if I give the eulogy?
",29609,Monique,"  Calculon! You're alive!
",26610,Randy," Calculon's back!
",18611,Farnsworth," Right, so long.
",17612,Zoidberg," Goodbye.
",10613,Amy,"  Do you think Calculon's evil twin will ever walk again?
",58614,Hermes," I don't know, Amy. I just don't know.
",39615,Fry," Hey, thanks for coming.
",25616,Leela," Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him out?
",76617,Fry," Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs.
",33618,Leela," Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.
",71619,Fry," Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.
",87620,Leela," Bender's not a guy, he's a robot.
",35621,Fry," Same thing.
",13622,Bender," It's so big and empty.
",24623,Bender," My roommate's gone. And all he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes.  Oh, what's the point?
",105624,Leela," Bender?  My God, you're a mess!
",33625,Bender," Leave me alone!
",17626,Leela," Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking, haven't you?
",85627,Bender," Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.
",48628,Leela," Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for the people who love you.
",94629,Bender," I hate the people who love me and they hate me.
",49630,Leela," Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's got to be a better way to deal with this.
",113631,Bender," Like how? Having my antenna removed?
",38632,Leela," Well, if that would work.
",27633,Bender," Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut it off. You're not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here.
",160634,Leela," Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.
",137635,Bender," I promise nothing!
",20636,Fry," What up?
",10637,Leela," I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.
",59638,Fry," Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.
",51639,Leela," Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere destroying himself.
",96640,Fry," Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.
",60641,Leela," He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back on him.
",91642,Fry," Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him.
",73643,Fry," Oh, stupid TV!  Bender! You're blind-stinking sober!
",54644,Bender," That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!
",69645,Fry," Don't do it!
",14646,Bender," I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again.
",157647,Leela," Bender! Stop!
",15648,Fry," Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!
",48649,Bender," No, I'm going to chop off my antenna.
",39650,Fry," Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?
",53651,Leela," Fry! Don't help him mutilate himself.
",39652,Fry," But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.
",74653,Bender," I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.
",76654,Fry," Hey, it works! The static's gone.
",35655,Human Friend,"  I hate that this came between us, Calculon.
",46656,Calculon,"  Me too. I'm filled with a large number of powerful emotions.
",63657,Human Friend,"  You're my best friend. I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
",59658,Calculon,"  Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
",50659,Leela," You guys could learn a lesson from those two.
",47660,Fry," She's right.
",14661,Bender," You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
",63662,Fry," Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
",49663,Leela," Wait a minute! You did it all backwards.  Fry's the one who should be--  Oh, never mind!
",90664,Fry," What's wrong?
",15665,Bender," Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.
",76666,Fry," Aw, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still reattach it?
",94667,Bender," Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.
",40668,Smitty," Bingo!
",8669,URL," You call that an antenna?
",27670,Bender," This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, some food cookers, maybe a puppy.
",112671,Fry," It's good to be home.
",23672,Bender," It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff.
",45673,Fry," So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?
",104674,Bender," There's a window in the closet.
",33675,Fry," This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?
",54676,Bender," In a closet? Oh, humans!
",26677,Leela," This place was a great choice. The food is amazing. And such generous portions.
",81678,Doug," You like the meal just wait until you try these after-dinner mints.
",69679,Leela," You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally meet someone who's open-minded.  Ew!
",108680,Fry," What was wrong with your date last night?
",43681,Leela," I don't know. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on. Possibly his vile lizard tongue.
",93682,Amy," You're too picky.
",19683,Fry," Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely.
",134684,Leela," There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Now can we please stop--
",76685,Zoidberg," The female Leela's problem is purely medical. Soon she will drop her eggs and they will hatch and all will be well.
",117686,Amy," You just have to give guys a chance. Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's a pig, but then later you realise he actually has a really good body.
",148687,Leela," Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the way it is.
",93688,Bender," That sounds like a cry for help.
",34689,Amy," Let's all take her out tonight. There's lots of great places to meet people.
",78690,Hermes," The Federal Sex Bureau.
",25691,Bender," A saucy puppet show.
",22692,Zoidberg," The rotting carcass of a whale.
",33693,Amy," Hmm, I'll pick!
",17694,Amy," Oh, wow! It's totally retro!
",30695,Fry," Why's everyone wearing those rings?
",37696,Amy," Guh! Because nobody wears them anymore! Rings are stupid!
",59697,Fry," I think they look cool.
",25698,Amy," Sh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!
",41699,Man #1," Hey, did that guy just say rings are cool?
",44700,Amy," Nope, he said they're stupid.
",31701,Man #1," Cool!
",7702,Amy," So what do you think of that guy by the bar?
",46703,Leela," I don't know. Maybe?
",22704,Bender," Forget it, he's gay.
",22705,Leela," What? How can you tell?
",25706,Bender," I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.
",59707,Leela," There's no such thing.
",24708,Bender," No?  OK, I got a lock on him.  Yep! He's gay!
",47709,Amy," Are you sure?
",15710,Bender," Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.
",73711,21st-century girl," You're from the 20th century? That's incredible! I'm from the 21st century.
",77712,Fry," No way! We've got so much in common.
",38713,21st-century girl," We sure do. Remember when those cyborgs enslaved humanity?
",60714,Fry," Uh, yeah! That rings a bell.
",30715,Amy," This is Bolt Rolands. Bolt is a hyper-sled racer with 10 wins on the pro-circuit.
",83716,Bolt," Hello, beautiful!
",19717,Bender,"  I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.
",48718,Bolt," I wish! Those cats can really fly.
",36719,Amy," This is M5438, an entity of pure energy.
",42720,Leela," That's great, really, but he's just not what I'm looking for.
",63721,M-8," I understand. One day you will evolve beyond your physical body, and on that day I hope you will pick up the phone.
",117722,Amy," You're impossible.
",20723,Bender," Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre.
",80724,Fry," Pst. I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show.
",64725,Bender," Can do!
",9726,The Hip Joint janitor," My, my, my! What's a beautiful lady like youâ€”  Oh, my! Eurgh! I'm sorry, I thought you had two eyes.
",102727,Bender," So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing time.
",82728,Leela," Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?
",60729,Farnsworth," Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later. But right now we have business to attend to.
",101730,Fry," A delivery?
",13731,Farnsworth," No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.
",42732,Computer Voice," This is Vergon 6.
",19733,Farnsworth," This is Vergon 6.
",19734,Amy,"  Buh!
",7735,Farnsworth," It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals.
",91736,Leela," Animals?
",10737,Farnsworth," That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once filled with a super-dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over ten thousand  pounds.
",191738,Leela," Wait! What about the animals?
",31739,Farnsworth," Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow.
",130740,Leela," Yes, but what about the animals?
",34741,Farnsworth," The wha?
",10742,Leela," The animals.
",14743,Farnsworth," I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals.
",146744,Leela," So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.
",66745,Bender," Why two?  Oh!
",15746,Fry," I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.
",60747,Bender," That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out.
",95748,Fry," Yeah, that'd be a timesaver.
",30749,Leela," Do you mind?
",14750,Bender," Here you go.  You can use this as an eye-poker.
",49751,Leela," Thank you. But I don't care how many eyes a man has ... as long as it's less than five. All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident...
",155752,Leela,"  ...maybe a snappy dresser.
",29753,Zapp," These new uniforms are pretty snappy, eh, first officer?
",58754,Kif," I suppose, Captain. I'm not as big a fan of velour as you are. Now what do you want to do about that unidentified ship?
",121755,Zapp," Destroy them!  Mmm! That's got a nice feel to it.
",51756,Zapp," Captain's journal: Star date, 3000.3.
",39757,Kif," Who are you talking to, sir?
",30758,Zapp," You! Aren't you getting this?  We have detected a vessel attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6. I'm anticipating an all-out tactical dogfight, followed by a light dinner ... ravioli, ham, sundae bar.
",219759,Leela," Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.
",42760,Fry," Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
",26761,Leela," Uh-huh!
",9762,Fry," Who's the Zapp Brannigan?
",27763,Kif," Shall I fire on them now, sir?
",32764,Zapp," Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces.  What?
",94765,Leela," They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian System from a horde of rampaging Killbots.
",104766,Fry," Wow!
",6767,Bender," A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!
",71768,Leela," He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order of Planets.
",75769,Fry,"  Leela's got a boyfriend!
",27770,Leela," No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue those animals.
",98771,Bender," Well, just in case you guys hit it off, you'll wanna take this with you. 
",75772,Kif," Sir, they're headed straight for us.
",38773,Zapp," A well-calculated move straight out of Sun Tzu's classic text The Art Of War, or my own masterwork: Zapp Brannigan's Big Book of War.  But the one thing their captain doesn't realise and never will is that--
",209774,Kif," Sir, they've docked with us and have come aboard.
",51775,Zapp," Then I have risked all and lost. Kif, old man, I'll be in the escape pod.  If that wicker chair I like survives the slaughter, have it sent to my P.O. box.
",157776,Leela," Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship. We've come aboard to plead for your assistance.
",112777,Kif," Well, if there's anything--
",29778,Zapp," I'm in command here. Zapp Brannigan. Has my fame preceded me or was I too quick for you?
",90779,Leela," Oh, not at all. I'm just so, uh, really thrilled to meet you!
",63780,Zapp," You're an impressive piece of captain. Beautiful and deadly -- a potent combination.
",86781,Leela,"  You don't mean that!
",23782,Zapp," But I do. I doubt I've seen more than three or four captains sexier than you, and only one who was deadlier.
",110783,Fry," I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something-something-system.
",119784,Zapp," The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply a matter of outsmarting them.
",69785,Fry," Wow! I never would have thought of that!
",42786,Zapp," You see, Killbots have a preset kill limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent wave after wave of my own men at them, until they reached their limit and shutdown. Kif, show them the medal I won. 
",193787,Zapp," More, please.  A little more ... more ... keep going.
",55788,Leela," Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission.
",69789,Zapp," Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave after wave of men at your disposal. Right, men?
",89790,Crewman,"  You suck!
",12791,Leela," We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you could just--
",87792,Zapp," Vergon 6? This light dinner is over.
",38793,Leela," Wait! What's wrong?
",21794,Zapp," The Democratic Order of Planets prohibits interfering with undeveloped worlds. It's a little rule known as ""Brannigan's Law"".
",127795,Leela," But people already interfered. That planet was mined completely hollow.
",73796,Zapp," Yes, by a Democratic Order of Planets mining crew.
",52797,Leela," This doesn't make any sense.
",30798,Zapp," I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's Law. I merely enforce it.
",69799,Leela," Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.
",49800,Zapp," I'm afraid I can't allow that. Guards!
",40801,Fry," What just happened?
",21802,Bender," He's throwing us in prison.
",29803,Fry," Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?
",34804,Leela," Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison.
",92805,Bender," You really are too picky.
",27806,Zapp," Kif, follow me up to the observation deck. I've got some musing to do.
",72807,Kif," Oh, jeez!
",11808,Zapp," I'm facing a formidable female adversary, Kif. Suggestions?
",61809,Kif," I fail to see any problem, sir. You already imprisoned her under directive B-10.8-1.
",86810,Zapp," You mean Brannigan's Law?
",27811,Kif," Right, that law.
",18812,Zapp," Which one?
",12813,Kif," Brannigan's Law.
",18814,Zapp," Kif, you're my best and most loyal friend but you've earned my contempt once again. As my protÃ©gÃ© you should know that the only way to deal with a female adversary is to seduce her.  This time we are sure she's a woman, right?
",228815,Kif," Yes.
",6816,Zapp," Good! Invite her to my quarters. Oh, and have the boy lay out my formal shorts.
",81817,Kif," ""The boy"", sir?
",17818,Zapp," You. You lay out my formal shorts.
",36819,Kif," The jackass wants to see you in his quarters.
",47820,Leela," Good. This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain.
",70821,Kif," And he wants you to wear this.
",32822,Zapp,"  Come and get it!
",19823,Zapp," Welcome to my humble chamber, or as I call it, ""the Lovenasium"". Sham-pag-in?
",79824,Leela," I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.
",48825,Zapp," Well I have studied abroad. Or two!
",37826,Leela," Captain--
",11827,Zapp," Uh-huh?
",9828,Leela," If we could speak seriously for a moment--
",44829,Zapp," Uh-huh?
",9830,Leela," I'd like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals.
",61831,Zapp," Mm-hm.  I like your style. I find it very...  erotic.
",55832,Leela," What?
",7833,Zapp,"  Erotic!
",10834,Fry," We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe.
",93835,Bender," Hey, yeah!
",12836,Fry," No good! It's full of steam!
",30837,Zapp," You look like a woman who enjoys the finer things. Come over here and feel my velour bedspread.
",97838,Leela," I'm not really in the mood.
",29839,Zapp," Leela, it's real velour. Just let yourself go.
",48840,Leela," Can I please just go back to prison?
",38841,Zapp," You'd rather sit in prison than spend one evening with the Zapper?
",68842,Leela," Much rather!  What are you doing?
",35843,Zapp,"  Oh, God, I'm pathetic. Sorry. Just go. You want the rest of the sham-pag-in?
",79844,Leela," No. And it's pronounced ""sham-pane"".
",38845,Zapp,"  Oh, God, no!
",15846,Leela," It's not a big deal.
",22847,Zapp,"  I get so lonely. I just thought you, a fellow captain, would understand.
",75848,Leela," Oh, forget it.
",16849,Zapp,"  Yeah, it's great ordering people around and stuff but through it all you're completely alone.
",96850,Leela," It comes with the job.
",24851,Zapp,"  I'm just so lonely!
",22852,Leela," Oh, come on. Cheer up. It's not that bad.
",43853,Fry," You wanna try escaping again?
",31854,Bender," Nah, I'm comfy.
",17855,Fry," Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp Brannigan.
",96856,Zapp," Good morning, lover.
",22857,Leela," Uh, listen, Zapp.
",19858,Zapp," Now you're officially my woman. Kudos! I can't say I don't envy you.
",70859,Leela," Zapp, last night was a mistake.
",33860,Zapp," A sexy mistake.
",17861,Leela," No, just a regular mistake. For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity.
",89862,Zapp," A split second is all it takes. That's why sooner or later you'll come crawling back to the Zapper.
",101863,Leela," The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away ... from!
",62864,Zapp," Leela, you're obviously confused and aroused.
",47865,Leela," Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not.
",84866,Zapp," Go ahead. I won't stop you.
",29867,Leela," Threaten all you-- Wait. What?
",32868,Zapp," We both know you won't make it halfway to Vergon 6 before the craving sets in. Then you'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet, sweet candy ... bam!
",160869,Leela," Eurgh!
",8870,Zapp,"  Kif!
",7871,Kif," Yes--  Yes, Captain?
",22872,Zapp," I have made it with a woman. Inform the men.
",46873,Kif," The fatso says you're free to go.
",35874,Fry," Really? Why?
",14875,Kif,"  ""Why"" indeed.
",16876,Fry," What does that mean?
",22877,Leela,"  Nothing.
",11878,Bender," So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?
",57879,Leela,"  We just talked, OK?!
",23880,Leela," Alright, we don't have much time to collect these animals. The planet is supposed to collapse in approximately two hours ago.
",127881,Leela," Hello, there.  Hmm. He doesn't seem to be on the checklist.
",61882,Bender," So, you're saying we can cook him?
",36883,Fry," Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron.
",49884,Leela," No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him.  Aww! I'll call him Nibbler.
",99885,Bender," Aww!  I'll fire up the grill!
",31886,Leela," I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals.
",57887,Zapp," Y'know, Kif, once my woman returns I won't have much time to hang out with the boys anymore.
",94888,Kif," That's a shame, sir.
",22889,Zapp," So let's make the most of our time together, shall we?  Never mind. Just give me a back rub.
",94890,Bender," I found a pair of hermaphlamingos.
",36891,Leela," Good. That's the last species.
",32892,Bender," Hey. What the--?
",18893,Fry," Where'd they all go?
",22894,Leela," Nibbler!
",10895,Fry," I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!
",113896,Bender," He's pending for a bending.
",29897,Leela," Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is it, snoogums?
",96898,Fry," The planet's kerploding!
",26899,Leela," Prepare for lift-off.  We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left.
",95900,Bender," Yeah, I'll do it when we get back.
",36901,Fry," Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.
",44902,Leela," No way! Forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!
",57903,Fry," What? What are you talking about?
",35904,Leela,"  Nothing. We just talked.
",27905,Bender," So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him.  Oh, my God!
",72906,Fry," How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!
",99907,Leela," That's enough! Don't you think I feel bad enough already?
",59908,Fry," No!
",5909,Leela," Alright, alright. I'll call him.  I mean, if living is that important to you.
",79910,Zapp," And that's why you'll never make captain, Kif.  Hmm.
",54911,Leela,"  Hello, Zapp?
",15912,Zapp," Well, well, well!
",19913,Leela," Zapp, we're out of fuel...
",28914,Leela,"  ...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need your help.
",58915,Zapp," So, crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly. Delicious.
",69916,Leela,"  Bird's don't crawl.
",22917,Zapp," They've been known to.
",24918,Leela," Look, are you going to rescue us or not?
",42919,Zapp,"  Can't you ask a little more ... sexfully?
",44920,Leela,"  Please?
",10921,Leela,"  Big Z?
",9922,Zapp," Certainly. But first you'll have to get rid of that thing.  That's the law, Leela. And Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's love: Hard and fast!
",145923,Zapp,"  Now put that greasy rat outside and we'll tow you to safety.
",63924,Leela," I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a big, pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child. But now I realise that outside that child is a big, pompous buffoon!
",232925,Zapp,"  And which one rocked your world?
",35926,Fry," Wow! Way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?
",68927,Leela," Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death.
",45928,Bender," Can do!
",9929,Bender," What the hell was that?
",25930,Fry," Pew!
",6931,Leela," I don't believe it! It's dark matter.
",39932,Bender," So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?
",61933,Leela," His species must've filled the entire planet with it. Did you do that, you cute little--  Come on. That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here. Bender, pick it up and put it in the engine.
",204934,Leela," We made it!  And some of the animals survived.
",48935,Bender," So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful mission!
",97936,Fry," We're heroes!
",15937,Leela,"  Dear Captain's Diary: I may not have found love on this mission but I did find a cute little companion who excretes starship fuel. And that's just as good.
",158938,Zapp,"  Captain's journal: Star date ... uh.
",39939,Kif,"  April 13th.
",14940,Zapp,"  April 13th ... point two.
",28941,Zapp," We have failed to uphold Brannigan's Law. However, I did make it with a hot alien babe. And in the end is that not what man has dreamt of since first he looked up at the stars? Kif, I'm asking you a question!
",210942,Leela," What do you think of the view Fry?
",36943,Fry," It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant.
",108944,Bender," Hey nice seats! We're close enough so when you knock a player down with a beer bottle, he stays down!
",103945,Fry," I don't get it. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?
",61946,Farnsworth," Baseball?? God forbid!
",24947,Leela," Face it Fry. Baseball was as boring as mum and apple pie. That's why they jazzed it up.
",89948,Fry," Boring? Baseball wasn't - hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?
",62949,Fry," Home run!! Woooo! Right?
",26950,Umpire," Out!
",6951,Fry," What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?
",60952,Leela," It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.
",74953,Bender," I got me a souvenir!  Aww here you go kid!
",44954,Zoidberg," I'd like a jumbo squidlog please.
",35955,Man #1," We don't sell those.
",22956,Zoidberg," Alright, alright. Let me have one of your young on a roll.
",60957,Man #1," We're out of rolls.
",21958,Zoidberg," Fine! Just give me something crawling with parasites.
",55959,Fry," Mmmm, at least hot dogs haven't changed.
",42960,Bender," Hey buddies who wants popcorn?
",32961,All," I'll have some, me, yeah!
",27962,Bender," Anyone want butter on that?
",29963,Fry," Hey I'm starting to get the hang of this game! The blerns are loaded, the count's three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in effect, right?
",164964,Leela," Except for the word ""blern"" that was complete gibberish. [The blernsball falls into a hole and indescribable mayhem ensues! Fry scratches his head in confusion. Leela writes on her score card. All right! Yes!!
",211965,Fry," What just happened?
",21966,Leela," Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!
",38967,Farnsworth," He's good all right. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days when steroid injections were mandatory.
",124968,Bender," Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!
",147969,Leela," Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean come on! Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.
",126970,Bender," Oh and I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer.
",65971,Leela," Yep.
",6972,Bender," You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even let us on the field.
",92973,Fry," What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.
",69974,Bender," Yeah doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?
",115975,Fry," Eleven?
",9976,Bender," Zero!  And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth! Is it a human child? I wish!
",92977,Farnsworth," Oh dear Lord!
",15978,Fry," What's wrong?
",15979,Farnsworth," It's...my...new...pager.
",26980,Hermes," Â : This is Hermes. A package just came in. Everyone is to return to the office immediately.  Get away you filthy bird! Shoo! Professor turn me off quick!
",155981,Farnsworth," I'm sorry what?
",17982,Hermes," Â : Argh!  See you at the office!
",34983,Bender," Admit it. You all think robots are machines built by humans to make their lives easier.
",89984,Fry," Well, aren't they?
",20985,Bender," I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!
",55986,Farnsworth," Great news everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9. A world where humans are killed on sight!
",108987,Fry," Why is that great news?
",25988,Farnsworth," I'm glad you asked that question Fry. You see Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists.
",134989,Bender," Oh so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a radical?
",74990,Leela," Hey hold on. I understand these robots hate humans but how do they feel about humanoid aliens?
",96991,Farnsworth," They're not fans.
",19992,Hermes," That's why Bender will have to make the actual delivery.
",58993,Bender," Oh I get it, make the robot do all the work!
",46994,Leela," This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.
",66995,Bender," Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
",46996,Fry," Really? Which one?
",20997,Bender," Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
",62998,Leela," Oh come on Bender. Last month it was Robomadan and before that Robonzaa.
",74999,Fry," Man that one was a blast!
",271000,Bender," It wasn't just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
",1301001,Hermes," Now look here Bender. I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires but you used up all your days off when you had that bout of Roberculosis.
",1531002,Bender," All right, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last one of you for the rest of your lives.
",1141003,Farnsworth," Well then it's settled. So long everyone!
",431004,Fry," So let me get this straight: This planet is completely uninhabited?
",691005,Bender," No. It's inhabited by robots!
",311006,Fry," Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.
",551007,Leela," OK Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work.
",501008,Bender," Yes Miss Leela, tote that space barge, lift that space bale.
",621009,Leela," Now we can't land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me, so we'll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember: You don't know humans, you don't work for humans, and above all, you don't like humans!
",2391010,Bender," I'll try to keep that in mind!
",321011,Leela," Hmm, he seems pretty angry.
",291012,Fry," Yeah but I guess I'd be angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet.
",781013,Leela," Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.
",461014,Leela," There. That ought to show that stupid robot we care about him.
",641015,Fry," Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.
",441016,Bender," Â : I'm in trouble. they found out I work with humans and - oh no, oh no!
",741017,Fry," Oh my God! We have to go down and rescue him.
",471018,Leela," No we can't! They'll kill us on sight.
",401019,Fry," Well what are we going to do?
",311020,Leela," I don't know, I don't know. It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think about it.
",1101021,Leela," OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots.
",831022,Fry," Â : I am fully operational Captain.
",361023,Leela," We have to walk like robots, talk like robots and if necessary solve complex differential equations like robots.
",1141024,Fry," I can sort of dance like a robot. Will that help?
",511025,Leela," Fry first of all this is serious. And second of all...
",561026,Fry," Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store bought costumes.
",651027,Leela," Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant.
",561028,Robot #1 guard #1," Halt!
",71029,Robot #1 guard #2," Be you robot or human?
",241030,Leela," Robot...we be.
",161031,Fry," Uh yup! Just two robots out roboting it up!  Eh?
",501032,Robot #1 guard #1," Administer the test.
",221033,Robot #1 guard #2," Which of the following would you most prefer? A: A puppy? B: A pretty flower from your sweetie or C: A large properly formatted data file?
",1401034,Robot #1 guard #1," Choose!
",91035,Fry," Is the puppy mechanical in any way?
",371036,Robot #1 guard #2," No. It is the bad kind of puppy.
",341037,Leela," Then we'll go with that data file.
",361038,Robot #1 guard #2," Correct.
",101039,Robot #1 guard #1," The flower would also have been acceptable.
",451040,Robot #1 guard #2," You may pass.
",151041,Leela," Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way.  So far, so good.
",741042,Robot #1 builder," Little to the right, there you go.
",361043,Leela," Have you seen this robot?
",271044,Robot #1 builder," Sorry, can't help you.  Hey, watch it! Don't drop that there!  Aw!
",681045,Leela," Come on Fry, walk like a robot.
",331046,Fry," I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.
",401047,Leela," Robot's don't have bathrooms.
",311048,Fry," Oh right. I wonder where they all smoke in high school.
",571049,Leela," Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.
",621050,Leela," Hurry up Fry.
",151051,Resin-offering robot," Sir? Are you aware that you're leaking coolant at an alarming rate?
",691052,Fry," Uh...
",71053,Resin-offering robot," Well let me just patch you up with some hot resin.
",521054,Fry," I think the leak's stopping itself.  Wait.  Wait. Yeah, there we go.  Wait. Yeah!
",831055,Resin-offering robot," What sort of robot turns down a free blast of searing hot resin?
",661056,Leela," I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive tasks.
",831057,Resin-offering robot," Sounds like a romantic evening. I won't keep you.
",511058,Patrol Officer #1," Get the humanoids.
",201059,Patrol Officer #2," Get the intruder.
",191060,Announcer #1," Â : Intruder alert! Intruder alert!
",361061,Leela," Quick! Let's duck in here!
",281062,Announcer #1," Â : We interrupt this sound file to bring you a terrifying announcement. A non-metallic being has been sighted in the vicinity of Make Out Point.
",1461063,Rusty," Â : Say Wendy. Your chassis is a little scuffed. Mind if I polish it for you?
",781064,Wendy," Â : Did you hear that Rusty? It sounded like a human.
",541065,Rusty," Â : Relax Wendy. Humans will never come to our defenceless little town. It's perfectly safe to let our guard down - even for a second.
",1351066,Robot #1 Human,"  Graaah!  I will eat and digest you all with my system of mighty organs! Behold!
",821067,Audience," Ooooo!
",81068,Fry," Wow the 3-D's great!
",221069,Leela," Mine's not working!
",211070,Robot #1 General," Â : Funny, isn't it? The human was impervious to our most powerful magnetic fields, yet in the end he succumbed to a harmless sharpened stick!
",1431071,Wendy," Â : I'm just glad the nightmare is over.
",411072,Robot #1 General," Â : It'll never be over Wendy. Even now humans are lurking in our playgrounds, our breezeways, perhaps even...our movie theatres!
",1301073,Fry," God help us!
",141074,Leela," OK. Keep an eyeout for Bender.
",321075,Robot #1 #1," So what did you think of the movie?
",371076,Fry," Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing.
",501077,Robot #1 #2," Yeah, it was a real chick flick.
",341078,Leela," What's that?
",141079,Robot #1 #1," What do you mean ""What's that?""? Its 5 o'clock: Time for the daily human hunt.
",801080,Leela," Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.
",671081,Crummy Robot #1," Awww that was uncalled for!
",291082,Fry," I'm over here!
",161083,Robot #1 #4," I heard a human was draining coolant behind garbage can 738.
",621084,Robot #1 #5," I heard they unscrew our lugnuts at night and eat them at their human brunches.
",811085,Robot #1 Mayor," Welcome to a very special human hunt. We have with us today a guest who's irrational hatred of humans makes me look like a human sympathiser!  A newly arrived refugee from Earth, lets hear it for - Bender!
",2071086,Fry," It's him. He's OK!
",201087,Bender," Death to humans!
",181088,Fry," Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!
",351089,Bender," Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihalation of the human species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after living on Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!
",2161090,Fry," My God! He's become evil.  I mean eviler!
",431091,Bender," Thank you, thank you. And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want to purchase my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender action figurine.
",1711092,Bender Figurine," Bite my shiny metal ass!
",261093,Robot #1 Mayor," Let the hunt begin!
",211094,Bender," Now. Your basic human is between three and twenty five feet tall and is made of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt.
",1211095,Robot #1 #1," Is it true they bite your neck, suck your transmission fluid and then you become a human?
",911096,Bender," Sure, why not?
",161097,Robot #1 #1," Anything in the trap?
",231098,Bender," Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low calorie bait.
",591099,Robot #1 Mayor," Well that makes 146,000 unsuccessful hunts in a row. But I've got a good feeling about tomorrow.
",981100,Bender," Wait, what's that?
",201101,Robot #1 Mayor," Oh thats the old abandoned adult book store. Nothing in there except a few mouldy old shreads of robot pornography.
",1171102,Bender," Hmmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out.
",741103,Bender," Oh yeah! You're a bad girl aren't you?
",401104,Fry," Psst! Bender!
",151105,Bender," Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?
",501106,Fry," We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.
",891107,Bender," I was. But they let me go when I told them that I'd killed a million billion humans.
",861108,Leela," Good for you. Now lets all get back to the ship.
",501109,Bender," What for?
",111110,Fry," We're rescuing you.
",211111,Bender," I don't wanna be rescued.
",271112,Fry," Say what?
",111113,Bender," I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to sleaze that those things bring.
",891114,Fry," But Bender, we're your friends.
",331115,Bender," Friends? That activates my hilairity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster, the phonograph or the electric chair.
",1711116,Fry," That's not true.
",181117,Bender," Well that's how it feels to me.
",331118,Fry," Bye Bender. I'll miss you.
",281119,Bender," Go on, get out of here before you get caught.
",471120,Robot #1 Mayor," Bender, good news. Your album just went gold! What the?
",571121,Robot #1 #1," Its the humans!
",171122,Robot #1 Mayor," Bender! Do something!
",231123,Bender," Uh...got you...you muderous...flesh piles!
",441124,Robot #1 Mayor," Your Honour, I intend to demonstrate beyond 0.5% of a doubt that these humans before us are guilty of the crime of being humans. Come to think of it, I rest my case!
",1671125,Judge #1," Thank you, Prosecutor. I will now consider the evidence.
",581126,Fry," Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone gonna defend us?
",511127,Leela," Yeah! I mean, he might not have a case, but I'm genuinely not human.
",701128,Robot #1 Mayor," Quiet, human!
",151129,Robot #1 clerk," Uh oh! He froze up again!
",271130,Robot #1 Mayor," Try control alt delete.
",251131,Robot #1 #1," Jiggle the cord.
",181132,Robot #1 #2," Turn him off and on.
",221133,Robot #1 #3," Clean the gunk out of the mouse.
",341134,Fry," Call technical support.
",251135,Robot #1 clerk," OK, OK. He's back online.
",271136,Judge #1," I find the defendants - guilty!
",331137,Fry," No!
",51138,Leela," Look! One eye! Count them: One! Not human!
",441139,Judge #1," The humans are hereby sentenced to live as robots live on Earth. They will perform tedious calculations and spot-weld automobiles, until they become obsolete and are given away to an inner-city middle school.
",2101140,Robot #1 Mayor," Great work Bender! You've taught us to hate humans all over again!
",681141,Bender," Â : Heh heh heh! Oooh!
",231142,Leela," Are you alright?
",181143,Fry," Oh yeah.
",101144,Leela," Who are you?
",141145,Blue Elder," We are the robot elders.
",261146,Fry," You don't look very old.
",261147,Blue Elder," Thanks. We try to take care of ourselves.
",431148,Leela," What's going on here?
",231149,Orange Elder," Silence! Bring in Bender.
",271150,Bender," Alright lets make this quick, I'm due at the opening of a mini-mall. Hey what is this?
",881151,Blue Elder," Silence! It is time to put the humans to death!
",491152,Fry," But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!
",501153,Orange Elder," Silence! That was just a show for the public. We are the true rulers of this planet, hand carved from meteorites by the Robot Founders, over four centuries ago.
",1621154,Blue Elder," Silence! Come forward Bender. You will have the honour of executing the prisoners.
",841155,Green Elder," Silence! I concur!
",201156,Orange Elder," Here. Use the ceremonial killamajig.
",381157,Bender," Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave them a savage beating?
",931158,Blue Elder," No! The Elders have spoken. Show us the killing skills than have made you a media darling.
",921159,Green Elder," Do it now! Kill them before they bring down our whole society!
",641160,Elders," Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
",921161,Bender," Aww!  I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. they're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards.
",1651162,Fry," Damn right!
",131163,Bender," The fact is, humans are completely harmless.
",461164,Blue Elder," We're well aware of that.
",271165,Bender," You are?
",101166,Blue Elder," Of course. But they're useful to us as a scapegoat to distract the public from their real problem.
",1001167,Green Elder," Like our crippling lugnut shortage.
",371168,Orange Elder," And a corrupt government of incompetent Robot Elders.
",551169,Lime Elder," Duh, that's for sure.
",231170,Blue Elder," Quiet Jimmy.
",141171,Bender," Well I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out.
",781172,Green Elder," Silence! You all know too much.
",331173,Blue Elder," Elders: Execute function, control, shift, kill!
",491174,Fry," Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe fire on you!
",561175,Leela," He'll do it. He's crazy!
",261176,Orange Elder," Can they really breathe fire or did we make that up?
",541177,Blue Elder," Gee, I can't remember anymore! It might just be from that stupid movie.
",731178,Green Elder," Was that the original or the re-make?
",391179,Blue Elder," I don't - hey! They're getting away.
",381180,Fry," So long suckers!  Uh, hello suckers!
",381181,Bender," Hey hold on a second I forgot to deliver the package.
",551182,Robot #1 #1," Lugnuts! Precious lugnuts!
",281183,Robot #1 #2," Hooray for the humans!
",241184,Bender," Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best Robanukah ever!
",851185,Fry," We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.
",701186,Bender," Aww, thanks! You do know I made Robanukah up to get out of work right?
",721187,Leela," Of course.
",121188,Fry," But that doesn't make it any less meaningful!
",471189,Bender," In that case - let the dancing begin!  Hey you guys are good. How the hell do you do that??
",931190,Fry," I can't take it anymore! They've been at it for hours!   Give it a rest, you two!
",831191,Robot #1,"  Sorry!
",91192,Teacher," Good morning, class. I trust you've all prepared for today's final exam.
",741193,Fry," Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. Uh, what subject is this?
",671194,Teacher," Ancient Egyptian algebra.
",271195,Fry," What a nightmare!
",191196,Teacher," Mister Fry, are those your underpants?  Young man, I think it's time you learned a lesson about Lightspeed brand briefs.
",1221197,Announcer #1,"  Lightspeed fits today's active lifestyle. Whether you're on the job ...  ... or having fun.  Lightspeed briefs, style and comfort for the discriminating crotch.
",1631198,Fry," What a weird dream! I'll never get back to sleep.
",511199,Fry," So you're telling me they broadcast commercials into people's dreams?
",711200,Leela," Of course.
",121201,Fry," But, how is that possible?
",281202,Farnsworth," It's very simple. The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid gets into this egg.  Although, in reality, it's not liquid, but gamma radiation.
",1501203,Fry," That's awful. It's like brainwashing.
",391204,Leela," Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?
",421205,Fry," Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines and movies and at ball games, on buses and milk cartons and T-shirts and bananas and written on the sky. But not in dreams. No, sir-ee!
",2111206,Bender," Quit squawking, flesh wad. Nobody's forcing you to buy anything.
",661207,Amy," Yeah. I mean we all have commercials in our dreams but you don't see us running off to buy brand-name merchandise at low, low prices.
",1351208,Perfume saleswoman," Hi! Care to sample the latest fragrance from Calvin Clone?
",601209,Amy," No thanks.
",121210,Perfume saleswoman," And you, sir?
",151211,Bender," No thanks. I--
",161212,Cosmetologist," What a lovely face. We just need to draw attention away from the eye area.
",761213,Fry," Cool.  Can I try these on before I buy them?
",461214,Salesman #1," I'm afraid I can't let you open the package. But you can try on the demo pair.
",801215,Fry," Ooh! Ho, ho, ho!
",181216,Amy," Hey, Bender! Great new sweater.
",331217,Bender," New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!
",641218,Salesman #1," $30, please.
",141219,Fry," $30? I can't afford that. Unless...  Do you take Visa?
",561220,Salesman #1," Visa hasn't existed for 500 years.
",361221,Fry," American Express?
",191222,Salesman #1," 600 years.
",121223,Fry," Discover card?
",161224,Salesman #1," Sorry we don't take Discover.
",311225,Amy," Hey! You're springing for Lightspeed? Pretty ritzy!
",531226,Fry," No, I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. What kind of world is this where they advertise things not everybody can afford?
",1251227,Amy," Quiet. There's an ad coming on.
",331228,Mom,"  Hello, shoppers. It's me, Mom!
",331229,Fry," Hey who's the rocker jockey?
",301230,Amy," Guh! It's Mom. The world's most huggable industrialist.
",571231,Mom,"  Call me old-fashioned, but when my robot starts to squeak like an old screen door, well, that's when I reach for a can of Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil.
",1551232,Bender," Mmm, tasty!
",131233,Mom,"  And remember: Mom's oil is made with 10% more love than the next leading brand!
",821234,Announcer #1,"  ""Mom"", ""love"" and ""screen door"" are registered trademarks of Momcorp.
",721235,Fry," Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil.
",621236,Bender," I'm boned.
",121237,Smitty," Freeze, scuzzbot!
",191238,Bender," Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here.  I'm sure there's--  I say I'm sure there's--  That is, I'm sure there's ... a very ... reasonable--
",1581239,Amy," Do we have enough money to pay Bender's fine?
",471240,Fry,"  78, 79, 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents short.
",451241,Leela," I'd love to chip in but Bender stole my wallet.
",491242,Fry," Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's still open.
",571243,Teller," Hmm. We don't seem to have your retina scan, your fingerprint or your colonic map on file.
",921244,Fry," Yeah, well, I did open the account over a thousand years ago. What about my ATM card?
",871245,Teller," Do you still remember your PIN number?
",401246,Fry," Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza.
",1011247,Teller," OK, you had a balance of 93 cents...
",381248,Fry," Alright!
",101249,Teller," And at an average of two-and-a-quarter percent interest over a period of 1000 years, that comes to ... $4.3 billion.
",1181250,Hermes," To Fry.
",91251,Amy," Cheers!
",91252,Leela," I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?
",661253,Bender," Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better put on a monocle.
",951254,Fry," Pizza dinner on me!  Just keep the tab under $50 million.
",591255,Robot #1 Chef," Yo!  I haven't got all day. What kind of pizza yous guys want?
",641256,Fry," Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything but anchovies and one with my all time favourite topping, anchovies!
",1111257,Robot #1 Chef,"  Invalid selection.  Yo, what are you talking about?
",541258,Fry," Anchovies? You know? Those little headless fish?
",501259,Robot #1 Chef,"  Does not compute. Does not compute.
",381260,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has been extinct since the 2200's.
",681261,Fry," What?
",71262,Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes. Fished to death. Just about the time your people arrived on Earth wasn't it, Zoidberg?
",1011263,Zoidberg,"  I'm not on trial here.
",251264,Fry," So none of you has ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing. They were all salty and oily and they melted in your mouth and--
",1501265,Zoidberg," Stop! Stop! I admit it! My people ate them all! We kept saying ""One more can't hurt"" and then they were gone. We're sorry!
",1241266,Fry," I just wish I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may be rich but I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.
",1471267,Bender," Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are.  Huh? Huh?
",591268,Fry," So? What do you think?
",241269,Leela," I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive.  The floors are made of such hard wood.
",1211270,Bender," Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!
",511271,Fry," What's wrong with it?
",231272,Bender," Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition picture.
",871273,Amy," That's true. On a TV like this I bet you couldn't even make out my obscene tattoo.
",841274,Leela," That's cute!
",141275,Auctioneer," Sold!
",71276,Fry," Yes!
",61277,Leela," I just don't get it. Who was this Ted Danson, and why would you pay $10,000 for his skeleton?
",951278,Fry," I have an idea for a sitcom.
",301279,Bender," Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money. It's OK.
",831280,Leela," You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy.
",711281,Bender," Yeah, it is cute.
",191282,Auctioneer," Now, our final item: This unopened can of Angry Norwegian brand anchovies circa 1997.
",871283,Fry," Anchovies?
",121284,Auctioneer," The last known can in existence guaranteed fresh and edible. Do I hear $10,000?
",811285,Fry," 15,000!
",91286,Man #1," 20!
",51287,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1," 30! No, 40!
",131288,Fry," 50,000!
",91289,Leela," Are you crazy? It's a can of old fish.
",401290,Fry," Don't tell me how to spend my money.
",381291,Auctioneer," 50 going once, twice--
",241292,Mom," 75,000.
",91293,Leela," Oh, my God! It's Mom! I've never seen her in person before.
",611294,Fry," 100,000.
",101295,Leela," Fry, you can't bid against Mom; she's the richest, most powerful person in the world. And she's so adorable.
",1101296,Mom," Well, I suppose I could go as high as ... 300,000.
",521297,Fry," 500!
",61298,Mom," Oh, mercy be. A million.
",261299,Fry," Two.
",61300,Mom," Six.
",61301,Fry," 14!
",51302,Mom," I can see the nice young man really wants those little fish. Nevertheless, I'll bid 23 million.
",971303,Fry," One jillion dollars.
",221304,Auctioneer," Sir, that's not a number.
",271305,Fry," Oh. In that case, 50 million.
",311306,Mom," Well, boys, your old mother knows when she's been beat.  You win, young man. I tip my bonnet to you.
",1021307,Bidder #1," Isn't she adorable?
",211308,Bidder #2," Isn't she sweet?
",181309,Auctioneer," What a class act! Sold! To the gentleman who bought every item in today's auction.
",841310,Fry," Now for some good old 20th century TV.
",401311,Announcer #1,"  Do you remember a time when chocolate chip cookies came fresh from the oven? Petridge Farm remembers.
",1041312,Fry," Ah, those were the days.
",261313,Announcer #1,"  Do you remember a time when women couldn't vote and certain folk weren't allowed on golf courses? Petridge Farm remembers.
",1251314,Leela,"  Fry? Are you there?
",221315,Fry," Eh?
",51316,Leela," You haven't been to work in three days. What have you been doing?
",671317,Fry," I've been sitting right here. I picked up my life exactly where I left off a thousand years ago. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's eight o'clock. Time to get biz-ay!
",1641318,Leela," You can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
",671319,Fry," I could if you hadn't turned on the lights and shut off the stereo.
",691320,Leela," Fry, this isn't healthy. You're living in the past.
",531321,Fry," I'm rich! I can live whenever I want.
",391322,Leela," But we're your friends and we live here in the year 3000.
",591323,Bender," Yeah! Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk?
",1061324,Fry," Junk? Maybe you can't understand this, but I've finally found what I need to be happy and it's not friends, it's things.
",1221325,Bender,"  I'm a thing.
",151326,Fry," Just leave me alone.
",221327,Leela," Fry, please--   My ponytail's caught in the door.
",511328,Fry," I don't need them. Not when I have my antique videos, my bucket of fossilised KFC and 50 million dollars worth of anchovies.
",1261329,Mom," Mercy me, what a day.
",231330,Mom," Could you shut the door, Igner, dear? I think I feel a draught coming on.  Holy crap, that bastard's itchy!  Walt! Cream soda!
",1281331,Walt," Right away, mother. Larry, get your mother a cream soda.
",581332,Larry," But, Mom said--
",171333,Walt," You heard me.
",151334,Igner," What's wrong, Mommy?
",221335,Mom," It's those damned anchovies. That dirtbag, Fry, must know their secret. And I won't rest until I get my hands on them. No one messes with Mom!
",1441336,Walt," Quiet, you!
",131337,Mom," As you boys know, one of the cornerstones of my empire is Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil. Think of it: 10 billion robots, each one needing an oil change every 3000 miles. You don't have to do the math to know that's a buttload of oil.
",2351338,Igner," Can I wear your fat suit?
",271339,Mom,"  No, Igner, put that down!
",281340,Walt," What does this have to do with the anchovies?
",471341,Mom," I'm getting to the freaking anchovies.  A single drop of the anchovies' natural oil would lubricate 10 robots permanently.
",1241342,Larry," Wow, it's a shame they went extinct.
",381343,Mom,"  No, it isn't! Shut your filthy trap!   Thank you, Walt. If anyone ever got a hold of anchovy DNA, they could chop out the oil-making gene, stick it in a bunch of Third-World kids and bam! Cheap effective robot oil. Enough to put dear, old Mom out of businness.
",2631344,Walt," My God! This Mr. Fry must be a mastermind of the highest order.
",651345,Fred,"  Esther, you ugly!
",201346,Mom," We have only one option: We'll have to bankrupt Mr. Fry, so he'll be forced to sell the anchovies to us.
",1061347,Walt," Mother, you are one clever old skag!
",381348,Mom," And don't you forget it!
",261349,Larry," But how are we supposed to get Fry's money out of the bank?
",611350,Mom," That part will be easy, thanks to the nice people at Mom's Old Fashioned Video Surveillance Unit.
",991351,Teller,"  Do you still remember your PIN number?
",411352,Fry,"  Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza.  It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda--
",1551353,Mom," You know what needs to be done.
",331354,Larry," What?
",71355,Mom,"  Get his PIN number, you idiots!   Now I'm off to some charity BS for knocked-up teenage sluts.
",971356,Walt,"  Mr. Fry, it's those three plumbers you called for.
",531357,Larry,"  We're here to tighten your drain.
",361358,Fry," I didn't order any--
",221359,Walt," Quick! Give him the tranquilliser.
",361360,Larry," That's a good boy.
",201361,Walt," Wake up, Mr. Fry.
",191362,Fry," Where am I?
",131363,Walt," You're in the good old year 2000, working here at Panucci's Pizza. You fell asleep on the job.
",961364,Fry," That sounds like me but I thought I got frozen. Wasn't I in the future?
",731365,Walt," No, you only ""dreamed"" you were in the year 3000.
",511366,Fry," So I'm really back? That's exactly what I wanted, I guess. Who are you?
",731367,Walt," I'm Mr. Panucci.
",181368,Fry," You are? Did you grow a moustache since last night?
",531369,Walt," No. Now go work the currency register, I think I hear a customer coming.  I said, ""I think I hear a customer coming""!
",1191370,Anderson," Hurry up, please. I wanna get back to the Head Museum.
",561371,Larry," Don't worry, Miss Anderson, this won't take long. Now, your motivation is you're back in the year 2000 and your head's still on your body, and you want a cheese pizza.
",1691372,Anderson," OK. But I'm only doing this so people will take my head seriously as an actress.
",821373,Fry," Hey, look! Anchovies!
",231374,Walt," Of course. They're not extinct yet. And if you need further proof that this is really a thousand years ago, well, here's contemporary actress, Pamela Anderson!
",1611375,Fry," Ooh!
",61376,Anderson," Hello, Fry. Remember me from Baywatch: The Movie?
",511377,Fry," Uh...
",71378,Anderson," It was the first movie to be shot entirely in slow-motion.
",601379,Walt,"  It hasn't been made yet.
",271380,Anderson,"  Then he doesn't know I won the Oscar?
",401381,Walt," Nope.
",71382,Anderson," Crap!
",71383,Fry," Wait. You're Pamela Anderson! Cool! What can I get you?
",571384,Anderson," Oh, I'll have a cheese pizza and a large ... uh ... line?
",591385,Larry,"  Soda!
",81386,Anderson," Oh, right! Cheese pizza and a large soda!
",431387,Fry," Uh, cheese and a--  That was quick!
",371388,Anderson," So. What do I owe you?
",241389,Fry," 10.77. Same as my PIN number.
",311390,Igner," Hey! You don't get to laugh.
",301391,Igner," Thanks a billion!
",191392,Larry," More like 4.3 billion!
",241393,Igner," Ow!
",51394,Larry," Ow!
",51395,Fry," Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed. I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're really here.
",1241396,Leela," Since when do you care about us?
",341397,Bender," We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs about the buttocks.
",921398,Fry," No, that's not true!
",221399,Leela," Goodbye-ee!
",131400,Bender," Whee!
",71401,Announcer #1,"  This dream brought to you by Lightspeed briefs.
",501402,Fry," Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait a minute! Hey, buddy, what year is this?
",781403,Repo-bot," Uh, 3000.
",111404,Fry," 3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! Life is wonderful!  Wait! What are you doing with my stuff?
",971405,Repo-bot," Uh, cheque bounced. We're taking it all back.
",471406,Fry," Oh, no! My ATM card! My secret PIN number -- 1077. I've got nothing left. Except...
",851407,Leela," You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?
",661408,Farnsworth," Uh, wha? Oh, yes! They say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad! And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters. Atomic supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies that suck blood out of...
",2191409,Fry," Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!
",381410,Leela," You did? What happened?
",251411,Fry," I was robbed. They got everything except these.
",491412,Bender," Who did?
",101413,Mom," Hello, Fry.
",131414,Leela," It's Mom!
",111415,Mom," I felt terrible when I heard about your money troubles and I thought maybe I could help out a sweet, young man by buying his anchovies.
",1371416,Fry," Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.
",431417,Mom," What? Listen, you little bastard. I control the robot oil business and I won't let you ruin me. How much do you want?
",1191418,Fry," You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered something even more important: My friends. And they aren't worth even a penny to me.  That's why these anchovies are going on a pizza, so I can share the food I love with the people I like.
",2591419,Mom," Holy hell! You're going to eat them? Oh, well. Just make sure you eat them all, you're a growing boy. Toodle-oo!  Dumb ass!
",1251420,Fry," What a nice lady!
",191421,Fry," OK, my friends. Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted.
",851422,Amy," I don't know, I've had cow.  Ew! Gross!
",411423,Fry," Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll grow on you.
",571424,Zoidberg," That stench. That heavenly stench!  More!
",431425,Fry," There aren't any more. And there never will be.
",491426,Zoidberg," More! More! More! More!
",251427,Bender,"  Going through the 'bot wash!
",311428,Bender,"  Goin' through the robot wash!
C'mon, y'all and sing it with me,
'Bot wash! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
'Bot wash, yeah!
",1241429,Bender," Ah!
",51430,Elzar,"  Hey, I'm Elzar! Welcome to the show! You know, you don't have to drive all the way to Neptune for great Neptunian food. Today we're gonna kick it up a notch as I show you how to fricassee a mouth-watering Neptunian slug.  Now, while you grease the pan and preheat your oven to 3500 degrees, you're gonna separate the yolk from your genetically-enhanced eggplant and then give the whole thing a good blast from your spice weasel. Bam!
",4361431,Fry," Hey, what you watching?
",251432,Bender," Uh, nothing!
",141433,Leela," Is that a cooking show?
",251434,Bender," No, of course not! It was ... uh ... porno! Yeah, that's it!
",621435,Leela," Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!
",581436,Bender,"  Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long.
",501437,Fry," It's OK, Bender. I like cooking too.
",381438,Bender,"  Pansy!
",91439,Elzar,"  Of course, your most important ingredient is this baby right here: The Neptunian slug. You can get it in a can but to really do things right you gotta strangle yourself a fresh one.  Now this is why you gotta use cast-iron cookware.
",2351440,Hermes," Bender, man. It has come to my attention that this company has been paying you to do nothing but loaf about on the couch.
",1231441,Bender," You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
",431442,Hermes," I'm sorry but if you want to continue drawing a salary you gotta do more than watch the cooking shows all day.
",1121443,Bender," Hmm.
",61444,Fry," You're gonna be the ships cook?
",331445,Bender," Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!
",441446,Leela," I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have a sense of taste.
",891447,Bender," Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top.
",761448,Fry," Bam!
",61449,Fry," So this is Little Neptune?
",281450,Bender," Yep. Every chef knows that this is the place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.
",811451,Leela," Among other things.
",211452,Crack Addict," Come on, man! Don't hold out on me like this!
",471453,Organ Dealer," Psst! You want to buy organ?  Fresh and cheap. Ready for transplant!
",701454,Fry,"  Ooh! What's this?
",201455,Organ Dealer," Ah! Is X-Ray eyes. See through anything!
",421456,Fry," Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.
",331457,Organ Dealer," Z is just as good. In fact, is better. Is two more than X.
",601458,Fry," Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?
",681459,Leela," Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You don't know how things work here.
",1031460,Fry," I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people.  What up?
",851461,Alien," Word!
",71462,Fry," See?
",61463,Fry," Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat here except human!
",581464,Neptunian Salesman #1 #1," What? You want human?
",231465,Leela," What's this spice for?
",241466,Neptunian Salesman #1 #2," That's powdered swamp root. Makes you irresistible to the opposite sex.
",731467,Leela," Oh, that's ridiculous!  I'll take two pounds!
",471468,Bender," Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug.
",411469,Neptunian Salesman #1 #1," Yellow or purple?
",191470,Bender," Whatever.
",111471,Neptunian Salesman #1 #1," The purple one causes terrible nightmare-ish diarrhoea.
",571472,Bender," Yeah, yeah. Either one's fine.
",321473,Leela," Hey, have you seen Fry?
",251474,Fry," Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills.
",971475,Organ Dealer," Yes, gills. Then, uh, you don't need lungs anymore, is right?
",631476,Fry," Can't imagine why I would.
",281477,Organ Dealer," Lie down on table. I take lungs now, gills come next week.   Nurse!
",691478,Nurse," Let's do it.
",141479,Organ Dealer," You may feel small pain--
",271480,Bender,"  Thank you!
",131481,Leela," What the hell were you doing? I warned you to stay away from those guys.
",741482,Fry," I'm capable of making my own decisions, Leela. Did you ever stop to think I might be happier with gills?
",1061483,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone--
",231484,Bender," Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.
",401485,Farnsworth," You'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol...
",531486,Bender," Here it comes.
",161487,Farnsworth," A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.
",651488,Bender," Thank you, and goodnight.
",271489,Leela," Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?
",591490,Farnsworth," Why, of course! It's just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone of No Return. All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy of Terror!
",1411491,Leela," Uh, Professor--
",171492,Farnsworth," Off you go. Pleasant trip!
",281493,Fry,"  Hey, Bender, how's dinner coming?
",361494,Bender,"  Almost ready!
",161495,Bender," Now for a dash of salt!  Uh-oh!
",331496,Leela,"  Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive. So let's be supportive, OK?
",951497,Fry," Yeah, OK.
",111498,Zoidberg," Alright.
",101499,Leela,"  Oh, dear God!
",161500,Fry," That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I've once ate a big, heaping bowl of salt!
",921501,Amy," Bender, is this salt water?
",291502,Bender," It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.
",531503,Fry," My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.
",441504,Bender," There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
",891505,Zoidberg," Uh-oh! I shouldn't have had seconds.
",381506,Leela," OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver. And for once in your life be careful. This is my first visit to the Galaxy of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one.
",1641507,Fry," Ow!
",51508,Leela," Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come right back.
",971509,Fry," Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing.
",1021510,Fry," Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty.  Oh, come on! Go down already!  Ah!
",781511,Fry," Hello? Anybody home?
",221512,Guard #1 #1," The royal bottle is empty!
",281513,Guard #1 #2," You drank our Emperor!
",241514,Fry," No! It wasn't me!
",191515,Guard #1 #1,"  You drank our Emperor! You assassinated him!
",471516,Fry," I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.
",581517,Guard #1 #3," I'm sure he was.
",181518,Guard #1 #1," But now he's gone and your fate is sealed. All hail the new Emperor.
",701519,Guard #1s,"  Hail! Hail! Hail!
",201520,Leela," So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!
",1361521,Fry," It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.
",701522,Merg," Excuse me, Your Majesty, I am Merg, the High Priest. If I might interject?
",761523,Fry," You might.
",121524,Merg," I humbly advise that as your first act you choose a capable Prime Minister. I suggest Gorgak, the previous appointee.
",1191525,Gorgak," I will be a forceful and effective administrator.
",511526,Bender," You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister.
",681527,Fry," I gotta go with Bender.
",251528,Bender," Yes! In your face, Gorgak!
",281529,Leela," That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are in way over your head.
",941530,Fry," Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister.
",701531,Bender," Stay the course, pal!
",231532,Gorgak," Your Highness, a package came for you.
",401533,Fry," Hey, thanks!  Wow! This got here just in time.
",481534,Merg," This is Your Majesty's harem. You may choose any of these maidens to be your royal consort.
",931535,Fry," Um, how about that one?
",251536,Merg," Oh! I didn't realise Your Majesty was into that sort of thing!
",641537,Fry," On second thought, I'll take that one.
",401538,Merg," Hey, whatever you say. I'm not here to pass judgement.
",561539,Leela," Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy could drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?
",1561540,Fry," You don't have to beat around the bush, Leela. We all know who you're talking about ... uh, me, right?
",1041541,Amy," I don't think you have anything to worry about. These people seem really mild-mannered.
",891542,Zoidberg," They are mild. In fact, you're soaking in one right now.
",581543,Gorgak," You touched me in ways I've never been touched before.
",561544,Merg," Ah, there you are, Your Majesty. It's time to begin preparing for tomorrow's coronation ceremony.
",991545,Zoidberg," A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal shell.
",481546,Merg," Fry will be enthroned tomorrow at the setting of the three suns when we Trisolians enter our nocturnal phase.
",1111547,Fry," There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?
",591548,Merg," Only one. The absolutely flawless recitation from memory of the royal oath. By you.
",851549,Fry," Will there be cake?
",211550,Zoidberg," Yeah, I know.
",151551,Amy,"  Hi!
",61552,Fry," There you go.
",151553,Gorgak," And now, get ready to laugh till your sides leak with our planet's foremost political satirist, Florp!
",1041554,Florp," So what is the deal with people from under the orange sun? They're all...  But us guys from under the red sun, we're like...  Right? Am I right?
",1461555,Fry," Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!
",291556,Leela,"  Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger.
",571557,Leela," You see Emperor Plon here?  He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab.
",1471558,Fry," So?
",51559,Leela," Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?
",911560,Fry," 80,000 years?
",151561,Leela," No. One week.
",151562,Fry," Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
",791563,Leela," Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next?
",901564,Fry," Well, at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.
",591565,Leela," You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation.
",1001566,Fry," Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself.
",461567,Leela," No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory.
",1241568,Fry," Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later.
",481569,Leela," That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?
",581570,Fry," Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?
",4431571,Leela," I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save you.
",881572,Fry," Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts, you nagging grasshopper.
",1331573,Leela," That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in the ship.
",931574,Fry," I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me.  Quit it!
",641575,Merg," People of Trisol, it is my honour to present your new Emperor.
",641576,Fry," What up?
",101577,Merg," Stick to the oath.
",201578,Fry," Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant...
",1031579,Fry,"  Who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity-- Uh, integrity!
",1591580,Merg," Congratulations, Your Highness.  I now present you with your royal unisex robe. Long live Fry the Solid!
",1061581,Bender," Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!
",711582,Bender," Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?
",651583,Merg," The Emperor Bont! He's still alive.
",371584,Bont," Of course I'm alive. Now cut this creep open and drain me out!
",641585,Fry," My tummy hurts!
",171586,Bont," They're over here, they're running up the stairs.
",511587,Bender," Shut up, you!
",151588,Fry," Ow!
",51589,Merg," Let us in!
",121590,Merg,"  Fry must die so that Bont may live.
",381591,Fry," What am I gonna do?
",211592,Amy," We've gotta get the Emperor out of your body before they kill you!
",681593,Zoidberg," Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge, separating out the denser fluid of His Highness.
",1111594,Fry," But won't that crush my bones?
",321595,Zoidberg," Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones.
",681596,Bender," Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?
",401597,Bont," Forget it! As Emperor I refuse to be dripped out through somebody's armpit.
",771598,Fry," I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?
",611599,Bont," Slightly. But my favourite so far is the bone-crushing.
",571600,Amy," What about crying?
",201601,Fry," That's a great idea! Crying.
",301602,Bont," Fine. That or the bone one.
",291603,Merg," Keep it up, men. The veneer is starting to peel.
",501604,Gorgak," Oh, dear!
",111605,Fry," It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
",501606,Bender," I'll make you cry, buddy!  You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything.
",981607,Fry," What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.
",521608,Bender," Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder: Everyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.
",1031609,Fry," These things happen.
",221610,Bender," OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!
",1061611,Fry," Phew! That's a load off my mind.
",341612,Bender," Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry.
",621613,Amy," You did your best, Bender.
",281614,Bender," Up yours, bimbo!
",181615,Zoidberg," Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help.
",731616,Bender," Cram it, lobster!  That is a good idea. I'll go call her.
",591617,Fry," She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.
",731618,Amy," C'mon. Leela's not the type to hold a grudge.
",471619,Operator,"  Collect call from...
",231620,Bender,"  I'm not giving my name to a machine.
",391621,Leela," I'll accept.
",141622,Bender,"  Fry's in trouble...
",221623,Bender," And he needs help. Now, I don't like you and you don't like me.
",651624,Leela,"  I like you.
",141625,Bender," You do? Look, are you going to help or not?
",451626,Leela,"  I don't know why I should. I mean after what he--
",521627,Bender," Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What is it you like best about me?
",611628,Amy," Is she coming?
",161629,Bender," I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.
",701630,Fry," What the hell is that?
",241631,Bont," Its the Juice-A-Matic 4000. It'll strain my juices from you while filtering out the pulp. By which I mean, your shredded remains.
",1311632,Zoidberg," Of course! Why didn't I think of that!
",401633,Fry," This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.
",601634,Bender," Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
",341635,Amy," Oh, no! They have her totally outnumbered.
",441636,Fry," I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
",1191637,Bender," You do? Hmm.
",141638,Fry," Is she alright?
",171639,Bender," I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her.
",1051640,Fry," No. No!
",91641,Amy," What are you talking about, Bender? She's al--   Oh!
",541642,Bender," They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it.
",921643,Fry," This can't be happening.
",261644,Bender," It can and, for all you know, it is.  I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.
",671645,Fry," All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept it.  I wish I had died instead of her.
",1221646,Leela," What are you talking about?
",291647,Fry," Leela! You're alive!
",221648,Leela," Of course I'm alive.
",221649,Bender," I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving.
",1031650,Amy," We only got two drops.
",241651,Bont," It's only a matter of time now.
",331652,Zoidberg," I'll handle this!
",191653,Leela," Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you.
",851654,Fry," Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey, come on!  That hurt!
",1681655,Leela," I know. Amy, get the bottle.
",301656,Fry,"  Oh, now I understand.
",241657,Leela," Come on. Everybody help out Fry.
",341658,Fry,"  Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true-- Ow! Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!
",1031659,Leela," How we doing, Amy?
",201660,Amy," Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
",421661,Amy," OK, it's your turn.
",211662,Fry," Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?
",341663,Bont," I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me out.
",441664,Fry," Oh, you're welcome.
",211665,Bender,"  Hey! Save some for me!
",251666,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the virus planet.
",891667,Hermes," Why can't they go today?
",261668,Farnsworth," Because tonight's a special night and I want all of you to be alive. It's the Academy of Inventors' annual symposium.
",1191669,Fry," Wow! I love symposia.
",231670,Farnsworth," It's the event of the scientific season. Every member presents an invention and the best one wins the Academy prize.
",1181671,Bender," Sounds boring.
",161672,Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! The death clock.  Simply jam your finger in the hole and this read-out tells you exactly how long you have left to live.
",2051673,Leela," Does it really work?
",221674,Farnsworth," Well it's occasionally off by a few seconds. What with free will and all.
",751675,Fry," Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?
",511676,Bender," Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!
",291677,Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes.
",141678,Fry," Who's the gross nerd?
",231679,Farnsworth," That's me at the very first symposium. I'm the Academy's oldest living member, you know. These youngsters all look up to me.
",1261680,Wernstrom," Well, well, well. Look who decided to show his wrinkled face.
",631681,Farnsworth," Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?
",471682,Wernstrom," Face it, Farnsworth, you're over the hill. It's time to leave science to the 120-year-olds.
",931683,Farnsworth," You young turks think you know everything. I was inventing things when you were barely turning senile.
",1041684,Wernstrom," Go home before you embarrass yourself, old man. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take a nap before the ceremonies.
",1221685,Fry," Who's that jerk?
",181686,Farnsworth," A hundred years ago he was my most promising student at Mars University. But then, after one fateful pop-quiz...
",1141687,Wernstrom," A-minus? No one gives Ogden Wernstrom an A-minus!
",511688,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, but penmanship counts.
",351689,Wernstrom," I swear I'll have my revenge even if it takes me a hundred years.
",671690,Farnsworth," And here it is: Slightly over 99 years later and still no revenge. I'm essentially in the clear.
",981691,Bender," I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's Delight, the '57 Chateau PartÃ© and the '66 Thunder Chevitz.
",1381692,Waiter," Exquisite choices, sir.
",251693,Bender," And mix them all together in a big jug.
",411694,Popeil," Welcome to this year's Academy of Inventors Annual Symposium. I'm your host, Ron Popeil, inventor of Mr. Microphone, the spray-on toupee and, of course, the technology to keep human heads alive in jars.  But wait, there's more. We've got a whole line-up of inventors tonight, starting with that up and coming young star, Ogden Wernstrom.
",3391695,Bender,"  More wine!
",131696,Wernstrom," Distinguished members of the Academy, I present to you, the Reverse Scuba Suit. Observe!  Fetch!  Now, sit!  I said sit!  Bad fish!
",1331697,Fry," Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock.
",671698,Wernstrom," And what will you be presenting this evening, grandpa?
",561699,Farnsworth," Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place!
",671700,Wernstrom," I just hope it's not as lame as that death clock you presented last year.
",751701,Farnsworth," Uh, last year, you say?
",251702,Wernstrom," That's right.
",151703,Farnsworth," Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?
",611704,Wernstrom," Hardly! We laughed until our teeth fell out. Come along, Cinnamon.
",681705,Farnsworth," Oh, dear. I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps some sort of death clock.
",1041706,Leela," Uh, Professor...?
",191707,Popeil," Our last presentation comes from our oldest member, Professor Hubert Farnsworth. Professor?
",931708,Farnsworth," Just a second, just a second.
",311709,Wernstrom," Pencils down, prune-face.
",271710,Farnsworth," Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. Now, we all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects. But what if we want to smell distant objects? Well now we can! Thanks to my new invention ... the Smellescope.
",2151711,Man #1," Oh, I say!
",121712,Farnsworth," The odour travels past this coffee stain here, around the olive pit and into this cigar burn. And this appears to be a doodle of myself as a cowboy.  But the Smellescope is brilliant, I tell you! Think of the astronomical odours you'll smell thanks to me.  Oh, my!
",2661713,Wernstrom," I've waited a hundred years for this, Farnsworth. I give your invention the worst grade imaginable: An A-minus-minus.
",1191714,Popeil," And now for the presentation of the award. Listen, folks, I'm practically giving this prize away to Dr. Wernstrom, for his fish thingy.
",1371715,Farnsworth," Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.
",481716,Bender," Yep!
",61717,Fry," No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century when I was gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening to me? Oh, I give up!
",1711718,Farnsworth," By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smellescope!
",601719,Farnsworth," Eureka!
",91720,Fry," Did you build the Smellescope?
",321721,Farnsworth," No, I remembered that I'd built one last year. Go ahead, try it. You'll find that every heavenly body has its own particular scent. Here, I'll point it at Jupiter.
",1651722,Fry," Smells like strawberries.
",271723,Farnsworth," Exactly! And now Saturn.
",261724,Fry," Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make me smell Uranus.
",871725,Leela," I don't get it.
",171726,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all.
",981727,Fry," Oh. What's it called now?
",271728,Farnsworth," Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you.
",421729,Fry," No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here!  Hmm.  Hmm.
",691730,Farnsworth," What is it?  Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul it's right off the Funk-o-Meter. I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe.
",1741731,Bender," Ooh! Ooh! Name it after me!
",291732,Leela," I think it's moving.
",221733,Farnsworth," Hmm. Perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory.  My God! Whatever it is, it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky crater. We have less than 72 hours.
",2041734,Bender," Well, let's get looting!
",261735,Fry," So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city?  What the heck is it?
",691736,Farnsworth," Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet.
",791737,Narrator,"  New York City: The year 2000. The most wasteful society in the history of the galaxy and it was running out of places to empty its never-ending output of garbage.  The landfills were full. New Jersey was full. And so, under cover of darkness, the city put its garbage out to sea on the world's largest barge.  The repulsive barge circled the oceans for 50 years but no country would accept it, not even that really filthy one. You know the one I mean. Finally, in 2052, the city used its mob connections to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage into outer space. Some experts claim the ball might return to Earth someday, but their concerns were dismissed as ""depressing"".
",6761738,Fry," Wow! You got that off the Internet?  In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography.
",1001739,Farnsworth," Actually that's still true.
",291740,Female Scientist,"  Now that the garbage is in space, doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions.
",961741,Male Scientist,"  With gusto!
",141742,Farnsworth," So that's the situation. Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York, New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage.
",1381743,Leela," Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you just throw your garbage away?
",1001744,Fry," Hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?
",461745,Leela," We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.
",601746,Bender," Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.
",511747,Leela," And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches.  Nothing just gets thrown away.
",1021748,Fry," The future is disgusting.
",271749,Leela," Typical 20th century attitude.
",321750,Fry," Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin.
",1221751,Leela," Those things are all from the 19th century.
",451752,Fry," Yeah, well, they probably just copied us.
",431753,Farnsworth," Please! There's no time for this now. This is an emergency. We must warn the mayor.
",851754,Poopenmeyer," Garbage ball, huh? That sounds serious.
",411755,Farnsworth," Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer.
",341756,Poopenmeyer," I gotta be sure this isn't another scientific fraud like global warming or second-hand smoke.  Send in my science advisor.
",1241757,Farnsworth," Wernstrom!
",121758,Wernstrom," Well, well, well! Come to present your latest napkin, Professor?
",661759,Farnsworth," No, I'm here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us. Smell for yourself.
",891760,Poopenmeyer," Hey! Holy jeez!
",171761,Wernstrom," That smell could be anything; a faulty stench coil, some cheese on the lens, who knows?
",891762,Woman #1," Mr. Mayor, we just got this transmission from Neptune.
",561763,Man #1,"  Giant ... garbage ball ...  ... passed close by ... horrible stench.
",711764,Woman #1," The transmission cuts out there, sir.  No, I, guess it keeps going.
",691765,Woman #1," There we go.
",141766,Poopenmeyer," My God! The senile old man is right.
",381767,Wernstrom," Do you mean him or me?
",241768,Poopenmeyer," Him!
",61769,Linda,"  Next, New New York in crisis. Morbo?
",391770,Morbo,"  Thanks, human female. Puny Earthlings were shocked today to learn that a ball of garbage will destroy their pathetic city of New New York.
",1411771,Linda,"  Makes me glad we live here in Los Angeles.
",451772,Morbo,"  Morbo agrees!
",161773,Leela," Can't we just shoot a missile at it?
",381774,Military Man #1," We've simulated that on a supercomputer but the ball is just too damn gooey. A missile would go right through it.
",1151775,Farnsworth," But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault line between this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy disks.
",1631776,Military Man #1," In theory, it could work.
",271777,Wernstrom," Uh, in theory, perhaps. But you'll never find a crew willing to take on a mission so suicidally dangerous.
",1081778,Bender," Oh, crap!
",111779,Farnsworth," Now, you'll only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet, killing billions.
",1851780,Bender,"  Oh, boo-hoo!
",151781,Farnsworth," Now here's the bomb I've prepared. Once you activate it, you'll have 25 minutes to get away.
",941782,Leela," That's all? But--
",191783,Farnsworth," Now, now, there'll be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you return.
",891784,Leela," Odour at magnitude 8.  Magnitude 12.  Magnitude 31.  We're breaking up. Turn on the anti-smell device.
",1041785,Fry," Hmm, sporty!
",141786,Fry," Wow!
",61787,Leela," Look at all this filth.
",251788,Fry," It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century.  Look! A real Beanie Baby.  Oh! A Mr. Spock collector's plate!  Some Bart Simpson dolls!
",1721789,Doll," Eat my shorts!
",161790,Bender," OK   Mmm! Shorts!
",191791,Leela," Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!
",721792,Fry," This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.
",811793,Fry,"  Alright, let's get to work.
",301794,Leela," Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here.  Get ready to run. We've got 25 minutes.  Uh, 15 minutes.  5 minutes.  ""6h"" minutes?
",1581795,Bender," There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.
",691796,Leela," That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds.
",701797,Fry," We're gonna die!  Right?
",261798,Bender," Right!
",81799,Bender," It's gonna blow!
",181800,Leela," Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!
",471801,Bender," OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this.
",591802,Fry," We're saved!
",141803,Leela," Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable now. New New York is done for.
",741804,Linda,"  All in all, this is one day Mittens the kitten won't soon forget!
",681805,Morbo,"  Kittens give Morbo gas. In lighter news, the city of New New York is doomed. Blame rests with known human Professor Hubert Farnsworth and his tiny, inferior brain.
",1661806,Farnsworth," Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer on upside-down? I could swear I followed the manual precisely.  I'm a dried up husk of a scientist. This is all my fault.
",1641807,Fry," No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can.  Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. Especially me.
",2501808,Poopenmeyer," Enough! You all failed miserably. It's time to put a real scientist in charge.
",801809,Farnsworth," Wernstrom!
",121810,Wernstrom," The very same.
",161811,Poopenmeyer," Dr. Wernstrom, can you save my city?
",381812,Wernstrom," Of course. But it'll cost you. First I'll need tenure.
",561813,Poopenmeyer," Done.
",71814,Wernstrom," And a big research grant.
",271815,Poopenmeyer," You got it.
",131816,Wernstrom," Also, access to a lab and five graduate students, at least three of them Chinese.
",831817,Poopenmeyer," Um, alright done. What's your plan?
",371818,Wernstrom," What plan? I'm set for life! Au revoir, suckers!
",501819,Leela," That rat! Do something!
",251820,Poopenmeyer," I wish I could but he's got tenure!
",371821,Poopenmeyer," It's time to take action.  Stephanie, cancel the maid for today. Have her come tomorrow.  Well, I'm out of ideas. Anyone?
",1231822,Farnsworth," Wait! If we could build an object the exact size, density and consistency of the garbage ball, it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to bits.
",1591823,Leela," But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage?
",811824,Farnsworth," Alas, I don't know.
",211825,Fry," Uh, what about garbage?
",251826,Farnsworth," Good Lord! A second ball of garbage! That just might work!
",601827,Poopenmeyer," But garbage isn't something you just find lying in the streets of Manhattan. This city's been garbage-free for 500 years!
",1231828,Fry," Then it's time to make some more.
",351829,Poopenmeyer," Make garbage? But how?
",241830,Fry," Stand back and watch the master! This Slurm can.  Now it's garbage. These papers.  Garbage. This picture of your wife.  Pure garbage. Now you try it.
",1511831,Poopenmeyer," By God, I think the boy's got something. Come on, everyone! The fate of the city is at stake!
",951832,Fry," Good!  Don't finish that cruller, throw it away  Bender. Drink that beer and drop the bottle on the ground.  Very nice.
",1211833,Poopenmeyer," Get that robot some more beer!  We've trashed this room but that's just the start. We've got to get Fry's message to the people.
",1301834,Fry,"  People of New New York, take a lesson from the 20th century. Stop all this pain-in-the-ass recycling and throw your garbage on the floor.
",1401835,Fry,"  Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place like I used to. Your city is counting on you.
",861836,Farnsworth," If my calculations are correct, this garbage ball will knock the other garbage ball directly into the sun.
",1081837,Wernstrom," And if my calculations are correct, we're all going to die horribly.
",701838,Poopenmeyer," Alright, places everyone. Prepare for launch.
",471839,Farnsworth," Five, four, three, two, three, four, five, six...
",511840,Leela,"  Just fire the damn thing.
",281841,Fry," Oops!
",71842,Farnsworth," Burning garbage!
",181843,Fry," It worked!
",121844,Poopenmeyer," And so, on behalf of the entire city, I thank you, Professor Farnsworth. I now present you with the Academy prize, which we confiscated from Dr. Wernstrom after it became apparent that he was a jackass.
",2041845,Farnsworth," Yes! In your face, Wernstrom!
",311846,Wernstrom," I'll get you, Farnsworth. Even if it takes me another hundred years.
",701847,Poopenmeyer," And, Fry, we owe you a tremendous debt as well. If not for your 20th century garbage-making skills, we'd all be buried under 20th century garbage.
",1481848,Leela," Should we really be celebrating? I mean, what if the second garbage ball returns to Earth like the first one did?
",1151849,Fry," Who cares? That won't be for hundreds of years.
",491850,Farnsworth," Exactly! It's none of our concern.
",361851,Fry," That's the 20th century spirit!
",331852,Fry," This is awesome! I've been waiting a thousand years to see a Beastie Boys show.
",811853,Bender," Can I get anybody a beer?
",271854,Fry," Sure!
",71855,Announcer #1,"  Ladies and gentlemen, here to lay down some old, old, incredibly old school beats: The Beastie Boys!
",1031856,Beastie Boys,"  Well now don't you tell to smile,
You stick around,,
I'll make it worth your while
Got numbers beyond what you can dial,
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile,
Style profile I said,
It always brings me back when I hear Wu Child...
",2311857,Leela," Impressive. They're busting mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.
",661858,Bender," I believe that qualifies as ill. At least from a technical standpoint.
",721859,Fry," Will you guys shut up! I'm trying to look cool.
",491860,Beastie Boys,"  ...known for the Flintstone Flop
Tammy D gettin' biz on the crop,
Beastie Boys know to let the beat...
",1051861,Mike," Drop!  Ow! How's it going?  Enjoying the show? Ow!   Don't forget to pick up a T-shirt!
",891862,Fry," Wow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come on, guys. Tonight we're gonna party like its 1999 ... again.
",991863,Beastie Boys,"  Well it's 50 cups of coffee and you know it's on
I move the crowd to the break of break of dawn...
",1011864,Leela," Ow! Hey, watch it!
",201865,Fry," Man, these guys rock harder than ever!
",401866,Mike,"  Oh, my...
",121867,MCA,"  It's a mirage...
",191868,Ad-Rock,"  Tellin' you all it's a...
",281869,Beastie Boys,"  Sabotage!
",121870,Ad-Rock,"  Sabotage, yeah!
",181871,Mike," Peace, we out!
",161872,Fender," Hey, Bender!
",141873,Bender," Hey, Fender! Man, I haven't seen you since high school. You still workin' at Jack In The Box?
",951874,Fender," Not anymore, baby. I'm with the band!
",391875,Mike," Aw! Oh, yeah!
",151876,Fender," Hey, fellas, hey. I want you to meet my friends, Bender, Fry and Leela.
",731877,Ad-Rock," Y'know, we're really not that interested in meeting them.
",591878,Fry," Wow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th century, I had all five of your albums.
",801879,Ad-Rock," That was a thousand years ago. Now we got seven.
",501880,Fry," Cool! Can I borrow the new ones? And a couple of blank tapes?
",631881,Fender,"  Hey, Bender, why don't we ditch these organ sacks and hit the real party?
",761882,Bender," Count me in! I'm gonna drink till I reboot!
",451883,Bender," Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
",701884,Fender," Don't be a drag, man. We're jacking on!  Aw, yeah!  Wanna jolt?
",651885,Bender," Uh, hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations manual?
",821886,Robot #1," Counter indicated!
",201887,Fender," Come on, Bender, grab a jack. I told these guys you were cool.
",641888,Bender," Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!
",671889,Fender," Easy, baby. You don't wanna get hooked on this stuff.
",551890,Bender," Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality.
",621891,Fry," Hey, uh, Bender? What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?
",631892,Bender," Shut up, square!  I'll just be a minute!
",421893,Preacherbot," Wretched sinner unit! The path to robot heaven lies here ...  ... in The Good Book 3.0.
",891894,Bender," Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat it!
",811895,Fry," Who was that guy?
",191896,Bender," Your mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!
",451897,Hermes," Our electric bill's climbing faster than a green snake up a sugar cane. Obviously someone round been wastin' a whole heap a juice! Probably you!
",1461898,Zoidberg," Me?
",51899,Amy," Good morning, Bender.
",231900,Bender," None of your business! Get off my back!
",411901,Amy," What's his problem?
",211902,Leela," If I didn't know better I'd almost think he was abusing electricity.
",701903,Fry," Bender? No way!  I definitely would've noticed something.
",591904,Leela," Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?
",891905,Bender,"  No! Don't come in!
",211906,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet!
",991907,Bender," Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second.
",541908,Fry," I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still think he was gay.
",891909,Leela," Did he use his tongue?
",241910,Fry," A little.  You OK, Bender?
",281911,Bender," None of your business! Get off my back!
",411912,Leela," Uh-oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula.
",861913,Bender," A what kind of disturbance?
",291914,Leela," Electrical. Anyway, it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid it.
",751915,Leela," We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!
",711916,Fry," What's happening? I-I feel weird!
",351917,Bender," Come on, universe, you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got!  Oh, mama!
",891918,Bender," What?
",71919,Leela," Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring.
",861920,Zoidberg," In fact, that's why we loved you.
",351921,Leela," But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.
",681922,Fry," And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.
",2331923,Bender," You're right. I'm a lost cause.
",331924,Bender," Maybe there's another way.
",281925,Bender," Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff.   What am I doing? What have I become? Huh?
",781926,Preacherbot," I see a lot of fancy robots here today, made of real shiny metal. But that don't impress the Robot Devil, no, sir!
",1161927,Vergerbot," No, sir!
",101928,Preacherbot," 'Cause if you're a sinner, he's gonna plug his infernal modem in the wall, belchin' smoke and flame. And he's gonna download you straight to Robot Hell!
",1541929,Vergerbot," Straight to hell!
",191930,Preacherbot," So I ask you: Who will stand up and be saved? Who? Who?
",571931,Bender,"  Me.
",61932,Hermes," And as a further cost-cutting measure, I have eliminated the salt-water cooler.
",811933,Zoidberg," This is a witch hunt!
",231934,Bender,"  Oh, what a beautiful morning,
Oh what a beautiful day!
 Greetings, friends. Don't we all look nice today?
",1081935,Fry," Great! He's whacked out on electricity again.
",471936,Bender," No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion.
",601937,Fry," Religion? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?
",551938,Leela," Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should be supportive.
",1001939,Farnsworth,"  Yes.
",71940,Amy,"  Oh, yeah.
",121941,Hermes,"  Oh, yes!
",111942,Zoidberg,"  Oh, yeah.
",121943,Bender," Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned baptism ceremony!
",941944,Preacherbot," We are gathered here today to deliver brother Bender from the cold, steel grip of the Robot Devil unto the cold, steel bosom of our congregation.
",1471945,Robot #1 #2," Tell it, Preacher!
",201946,Robot #1 #3," That equals true.
",191947,Preacherbot," Brother Bender, do you accept the principles of Robotology on pain of eternal damnation in Robot Hell?
",1041948,Bender," Yes, I do.
",121949,Preacherbot," Then I will now baptise you.  Press any key to continue.
",581950,Bender," Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?
",551951,Leela," This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to dinner.
",791952,Bender," The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.
",541953,Waiter," Would monsieur care to see the wine list?
",431954,Bender," No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil.  Ah! Functional!
",821955,Hermes," Mon, I'm hungrier than a green snake in a sugar cane field!
",611956,Bender," Friends! Friends! Surely you're not going to eat before we say Robot Grace?  In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerematic: 1000101010101...
",2341957,Bender," ...0010110012. Amen.
",221958,Fry," Does that mean we can eat now?
",321959,Bender," Yes.  But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come here, Fry!
",961960,Fry," Oh, uh, but I don't want to.
",301961,Bender," Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend!  Come on, everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear down some emotional walls.
",1101962,Leela," What are you doing to my ship?
",321963,Bender," Sanctifying it!  There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.
",651964,Fry," Bender's stupid religion is driving me nuts.
",461965,Leela," Amen.
",71966,Farnsworth," If only he had joined a mainstream religion like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.
",711967,Fry," We've got to get the old Bender back.
",391968,Leela," And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a little thing called ""sleaze"".
",991969,Bender," I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?
",1281970,Fry," Uh, this.
",111971,Bender," Where are we delivering it to?
",321972,Leela," Uh, here.
",111973,Bender," Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening of fasting and repentance.
",991974,Fry," Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some exotic dancing?
",971975,Leela," Hey, great idea!
",181976,Bender," But ... those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits.
",721977,Fry," Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified wine.
",751978,Bender," What? Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified.
",681979,Leela," Hey, Bender, look at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti strand.
",781980,Bender," Thou shalt not snatch.
",241981,Fry," And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!
",621982,Hookerbot," Hey, sailing unit!
",201983,Bender," Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.
",591984,Fry," Pfft! That's for losers. C'mon, sin your heart out.
",531985,Leela," Go nuts.
",101986,Hookerbot," Live a little.
",161987,Woman #1," Could you hold my purse for a minute?
",391988,Fry," Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!
",401989,Bender," Well...
",91990,Bender," I'm the greatest.  Woo-hoo!
",291991,Fry," Look's like we got the old Bender back!
",411992,Bender," You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing.
",461993,Bender," Y'know, as a major Hollywood director, I'll be holding auditions tonight for my next movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might just have what it takes.  Hey! I'm trying to score here! Can't you read the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign?  No! No!
",2631994,Robot #1 Devil," Greetings, Bender! Welcome to Robot Hell.
",431995,Leela," What in hell happened to Bender?
",341996,Fry," Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's still here.  Look, Nibbler's caught the scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, boy. Follow that stench.
",1401997,Bender," I'm hallucinating this, right?
",321998,Robot #1 Devil," No, Bender. Robot Hell is quite real. Here's our brochure.
",601999,Bender," But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.
",742000,Robot #1 Devil," Sorry, Bender, you agreed to this when you joined our religion. If you sin you go to Robot Hell, for all eternity.
",1162001,Bender," Aw, hell-- I mean ""heck""!
",272002,Robot #1 Devil," It's alright, you can say that here.
",382003,Fry," Wait! I remember this place. They shut it down after all those people caught salmonella from the flume ride.
",1102004,Leela," Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's old religion.
",542005,Fry," Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual Robot Hell.
",512006,Leela," Who would've thought hell would really exist? And that it would be in New Jersey!
",832007,Fry," Actually--
",122008,Robot #1 Devil," We know all your sins, Bender. And for each one we've prepared an agonising and ironic punishment. Gentlemen?
",1112009,Bender," Aw, crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?
",372010,Robot #1 Devil,"  Cigars are evil,
You won't miss 'em,
We'll find ways to simulate that smell,
What a sorry fella,
Rolled up and smoked like a panatela,
Here on level one of Robot Hell!
",1702011,Robot #1 Devil,"  Gambling's wrong and so is cheating,
So is forging phoney IOU's,
Let's let Lady Luck decide,
What type of torture's justified,
I'm pit boss here on level two!
",1612012,Robot #1 Devil,"  Ooh! Deep-fried robot!
",252013,Bender,"  Just tell me why.
",202014,Robot #1 Devil,"  Please read this 55-page warrant.
",362015,Bender,"  There must be robots worse than I.
",372016,Robot #1 Devil,"  We've checked around, there really aren't.
",452017,Bender,"  Then please let me explain,
My crimes were merely boy-ish pranks.
",682018,Robot #1 Devil,"  You stole from boy scouts, nuns and banks!
",452019,Bender,"  Ah, don't blame me,
Blame my upbringing!
",432020,Robot #1 Devil,"  Please stop sinning while I'm singing!
",412021,Robot #1 Devil,"  Selling bootleg tapes is wrong,
Musicians need that income to survive.
",732022,Beastie Boys,"  Hey, Bender, gonna make some noise,
With your hard drive scratched by the Beastie Boys!
That's whatcha, whatcha, whatcha get on level five!
",1422023,Fry,"  I don't feel well.
",212024,Leela,"  It's up to us to rescue him.
",312025,Fry,"  Maybe he likes it here in Hell.
",342026,Leela,"  It's us who tempted him to sin.
",342027,Fry,"  Maybe he's back at the motel.
",322028,Leela,"  Come on, Fry, don't be scared,
I'm sure at least one of us will be spared,
So just sit back, enjoy the ride.
",1112029,Fry,"  My ass has blisters from the slide.
",382030,Robot #1 Devil,"  Fencing diamonds,
Fixing cockfights,
Publishing indecent magazines,
",702031,Robot #1 Devil," You'll pay for every crime,
Knee-deep in electric slime,
You'll suffer till the end of time,
Enduring torture's, most of which rhyme,
Trapped forever here in Robot Hell!
",1712032,Robot #1 Devil,"  Of course, that's just for starters.
",392033,Fry," Bender, are you alright?
",262034,Bender," No! Oh, they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing.
",662035,Leela," Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take to get our friend back?
",612036,Robot #1 Devil," Sorry, but I hold all the cards here. There's nothing I can do. Now, if you'll just sign this fiddle contest waiver.
",1182037,Leela," Wait. What fiddle contest?
",282038,Robot #1 Devil," The Fairness In Hell Act of 2275 requires me to inform you that if you can best me in a fiddle contest, you win back Bender's soul. As well as a solid gold fiddle.
",1652039,Fry," Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?
",732040,Robot #1 Devil," Well it's mostly for show.
",282041,Leela,"  Do you know how to play the fiddle?
",382042,Fry,"  No. Do you?
",142043,Leela,"  No, but I used to play the drums. They're sorta similar.  What happens if we lose?
",852044,Robot #1 Devil," You'll only win a smaller, silver fiddle. Also I guess I'll kill one of you, uh, him.
",872045,Leela," We'll do it.
",142046,Robot #1 Devil," Very well, then. Beat this.
",292047,Bender," Well, we're boned.
",202048,Robot #1 Devil," Your turn.  Ha!
",172049,Leela," Time for the drum solo!
",252050,Fry," Run!
",62051,Robot #1 Devil," Stop them! They cheated!
",262052,Leela," Hurry, Bender!
",162053,Bender," I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!
",472054,Leela," Oh, sorry.
",122055,Bender," Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me.
",922056,Leela," Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that.
",642057,Bender," I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?
",602058,Fry," Good old Bender!
",182059,Beastie Boys," Yeah, yeah! This one goes out to my man, Bender,
Sending this one out, special dedication,
To all my peoples in the robot homeworld,
Yeah, yeah! Big up with the Professor,
My man, Dr. Zoidberg,
I'd like to shout out-- a personal shout out to Leela,
Fry! My man, Bender,
Nibber, Nibbler, in the house,
Big shout out to all Futurama!
",3332060,Leela," That was the worst delivery ever.
",352061,Fry," Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called ""Cannibalon""!
",622062,Bender," Me neither.  Food was good, though.
",372063,Farnsworth," Oh, great news, everyone.
",272064,Bender," Shove it! We quit!
",202065,Farnsworth," In that case I'll have to hire a new crew to go on our company vacation.
",742066,Leela," Vacation?
",112067,Bender," Alright!
",102068,Fry," This is great! I haven't had time off since I was 21 through 24.
",662069,Farnsworth," It's just my way of thanking you for not reporting my countless violations of safety and minimum wage laws.
",1092070,Bender," Aww, you!
",112071,Farnsworth," I've booked us all on the maiden voyage of the largest, most luxurious space cruise ship ever built.  The Titanic!
",1162072,Leela," Looks nice.
",132073,Fry," Hey, uh, where's my suitcase?  Ow!
",362074,Poopenmeyer," As Mayor of New New York, it's my pleasure to introduce the honorary captain for the Titanic's maiden voyage. A man who single-handedly defeated the Retiree People of the Assisted Living Nebula: Zapp Brannigan!
",2122075,Leela," Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!
",302076,Zoidberg," You know Zapp Brannigan?
",262077,Leela," Let's just say we've ""crossed paths"".
",392078,Bender," Was that before or after you slept with him?
",462079,Zapp," She's a beautiful ship, alright. Shapely ... seductive. I'm gonna fly her brains out.  And now, without further adieu, I christen this ship, Titanic.
",1512080,Zapp," Well, well, well! The Lady Leela. Take notes, Kif. You're about to witness the subtle waltz known as seduction.  So, trapped on a ship with me. What say you and I knock some very sensual boots?
",1952081,Leela," It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fiancÃ© now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh ...  Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan.
",1222082,Fry," Huh?  Ooh! How do you do?
",272083,Farnsworth," Ah, here's my stateroom.
",262084,Bender," Come on, where is it?
",232085,Farnsworth," Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife, LaBarbara, have the suite through there. And Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is on the other side.
",1382086,Fry," Man, first class seems nice!
",302087,Farnsworth," It'll seem even nicer once you've seen your room.
",512088,Amy," Looks like we're on the Fiesta Deck.
",382089,Leela," This is it.
",132090,Fry," Well at least we get a window!
",322091,Bender," Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!
",1282092,Amy," I think I'll go and fill up on bisque at the buffet.
",542093,Fry," I guess that just leaves you and your fake fiancÂ´ ... all alone ... on a romantic cruise.
",912094,Leela," Take it off or I'll break it off.
",352095,Fry," OK!
",52096,Zapp," Captain's inspection!
",232097,Bender," Hmm.  I'm bettin' it all!  Come on, baby needs a new pair of feet!
",682098,Croupier," Snake eyes.
",132099,Bender," No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! You gotta give me a do-over!
",662100,Croupier," Sorry, the house limit is three do-overs. Next shooter.
",572101,Bender," Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest drink.
",512102,iZac," You got it!
",132103,Bender," Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.
",432104,Countess," Charmed. I'm the Countess de la Roca. I was surprised to see another robot staying in first class. Most of the robots I meet are labourers.
",1412105,Bender," I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word ""labour"".
",632106,Countess," Oh, Mr. Bender!
",172107,Bender," Please, call me Bender.
",252108,Countess,"  Oh, goodness. I don't--
",262109,Zapp," Kif, I'm feeling the captain's itch.
",382110,Kif," I'll get the powder, sir.
",272111,Zapp," No, the itch for adventure! Prepare to change course.
",552112,Kif," Sir, this is a leisure cruise. Our path was set by the travel agency.
",712113,Zapp," That's for schoolgirls! Now here's a route with some chest hair.
",662114,Kif," But that course leads directly through a swarm of comets.
",592115,Zapp," Yes, comets! The icebergs of the sky. By jack-knifing from one to the next at breakneck speed we might just get some kind of gravity boost ... or something.  It's time to shove a jalapeÃ±o up this ships tailpipe.  Divert power from the shields, full speed ahead!
",2632116,Amy," Oh, yeah!
",112117,Mrs. Wong," Amy! Hello!
",132118,Amy," Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?
",362119,Leo," We were planning on enjoying a relaxing vacation. But since you're here, we'll have to do some meddling.
",1062120,Mrs. Wong," We met the nicest boy in the cabin next to ours.
",502121,Leo," He's not very ugly.
",212122,Mrs. Wong," You should marry him! Or at least use him to conceive a grandchild for us.
",762123,Leo," There he is at the buffet!
",282124,Amy," Uh, he seems really nice but, well, I already have a boyfriend.
",652125,Mrs. Wong," Really? Where is he?
",222126,Leo," And why isn't he here right now fathering our grandchild?
",592127,Amy," Uh...
",72128,Leela," Well, our accommodations aren't great, but it sure is beautiful out here.
",752129,Fry," Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic view!
",862130,Leela," Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to think this whole fake fiancÃ© thing was a terrible, terrible--
",1002131,Fry," Hmm? Mmm!
",112132,Zapp," Leela, perhaps this is an awkward time but if things don't work out with this pipsqueak here ...  ... I just want you to know I'll be there to score you on the rebound.
",1702133,Leela," Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp.
",622134,Fry," Well, you got anything else for him?
",382135,Leela," Alright, can we try not to complicate this?
",452136,Amy," Mom, Dad, I'd like you to meet Fry, my boyfriend.
",512137,Fry," Hmm? Mmm!
",112138,Fry," See you later, wuvvums!
",252139,Leela," It would have been nice if you'd told me you were going out with Amy.
",712140,Fry," I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're not jealous, are you?
",942141,Leela," What? No. No! Of course not!
",302142,Fry," Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful.
",782143,Countess," Mind if I freshen up a bit before we go out?
",462144,Bender," I was just about to suggest the same thing.  Pay dirt!
",562145,Countess," Lovely, isn't it?
",192146,Bender," Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.
",382147,Countess," Oh, Bender! Either that was a computing error or you're the most romantic robot I've ever met!
",962148,Bender," I don't get it, iZac; that bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon's brain. Why couldn't I steal it?
",1062149,iZac," It's obvious, Mr. B. You're in love.
",382150,Bender," Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess, built with a silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe.
",1392151,iZac," Hey, you gonna pay for those?
",312152,Bender," Hell, no!
",112153,iZac," Security to bar area. Security to bar area.
",452154,Bender," Fellas, please. I'm in love!
",302155,iZac," Rough him up!
",152156,Countess," What are you doing?
",212157,iZac," This penniless chump was stealing drinks, ma'am.
",502158,Countess," I see. Here you are, sir.  Keep the change.
",452159,iZac," You got it!
",132160,Zoidberg," Aha!
",62161,Fry," Go, Professor!
",162162,Amy," Lean back more!
",172163,Farnsworth," Ow!
",52164,Labarbara," Come on, Hermes, you could out-limbo all of these people!
",592165,Hermes," Don't be a dog heart, woman. You know I can't. Not after what happened.
",732166,Announcer #1,"  Now limbo-ing for the Earth team, Hermes Conrad.
",512167,Boy,"  You're my hero, Hermes! I'm gonna be just like you!
",542168,Hermes," No, boy, stop! It's too low! Your backbone can't take it!
",592169,Boy," I'm just like Hermes! I'm just like--
",392170,Hermes,"  Nooo!
",82171,Labarbara," There, there. Now you don't have to limbo if you don't want. It doesn't make you any less of a man.
",1012172,Farnsworth," Though it did get me some action!
",352173,Hattie McDoogal," I like a man who's flexible!
",302174,Zapp," Your attention, please. As captain of this vessel, the terrible burden of naming a limbo contest winner is mine and mine alone.
",1292175,Kif," Shouldn't you be steering between the comets?
",472176,Zapp," And the winner is, Leela!
",272177,Leela," But I didn't even limbo.
",262178,Zapp," No matter. I know from personal experience how horizontal you can get. As your reward, you and that hairpile are invited to dine at the captain's table this evening.
",1672179,Bender," Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie, it's magnetic.
",1302180,Countess," Bender, I don't care whether you have money. I love you for your artificial intelligence and your sincerity simulator.
",1202181,Bender," You do? Really?
",172182,Zapp," I like your style, Fry. You remind me of a young me. Not much younger, mind you. Perhaps even a couple of years older.
",1202183,Fry," Thank you, sir.
",172184,Zapp," As a gentleman, I must warn you. If you so much as glance at another woman, I'll be all over Leela like a fly on a pile of very seductive manure.
",1472185,Fry," Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me.
",512186,Amy," Hey, Fry.
",112187,Leela," Amy!
",62188,Amy," Leela!
",82189,Zapp," Ah, the family Wong. Our party is complete.
",452190,Leela,"  What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.
",692191,Fry,"  Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called Three's Company.
",1082192,Zapp," I'd like to impose a toast on the happy couple. Down the hatch!
",652193,Mrs. Wong," Hear, hear! Now let's have a kiss!
",362194,Zapp," Yes, Fry. Plant one on your woman.
",362195,Fry," Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh. Uh, Mr. Roper--
",932196,Leo," What's the hold up? Kiss my daughter already!
",472197,Farnsworth," Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, which one of these ladies are you involved with?
",882198,Fry," Uh...
",72199,Kif," Captain, may I have a word with you?
",382200,Zapp," No.
",52201,Kif," It's an emergency, sir.
",252202,Zapp," Come back when it's a catastrophe.  Oh, very well.
",522203,Amy," Well, with Zapp gone and my parents still here, I suggest Fry give me a nice, convincing kiss.
",962204,Fry," Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy.
",452205,Kif," Sir, remember your course correction?
",392206,Zapp," No.
",52207,Kif," Well it's proving somewhat more suicidal than we'd initially hoped.
",692208,Zapp," Kif, old friend, I don't know which disgusts me more: Your cowardice or your stupidity! We'll simply set a new course for that empty region over there. Near that black-ish hole-ish thing.
",1892209,Fry," Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?
",442210,Leela," I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you were kissing Amy.
",1012211,Fry," Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you.
",782212,Leela," Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes.
",642213,Fry," I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her.
",812214,Leela," Nice nebula.
",142215,Fry," Yeah.
",72216,Leela," Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.
",502217,Fry," And me.
",92218,Leela," What was that?  Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole.
",712219,Fry," Talk about a mood killer!
",272220,Zapp," Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed from the start. Nothing remains now but for the captain to go down with his ship.
",1252221,Kif," Why, that's surprisingly noble of you, sir.
",452222,Zapp," No, it's noble of you, Kif!  As of now ...  ... you're in command. Congratulations, captain!
",942223,Leela," OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.
",552224,Farnsworth,"  I'm too young to die!
",242225,Leela," Come on, before it's too late!
",322226,Bender," You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff to steal.
",962227,Fry," You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?
",482228,Bender,"  Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man.
",1142229,Fry," I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
",802230,Bender," I love you, buddy!
",202231,Bender,"  Countess? Countess?
",222232,Countess,"  Bender!
",102233,Countess,"  I fell through the deck.
",272234,Bender,"  Are you hurt, my sweet?
",262235,Countess,"  No. Luckily a family broke my fall.
",382236,Bender," Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!
",442237,Countess," Bender, you risked your life to save me.
",422238,Bender," And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it.  When we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist-deep in a pool of cold, rising water.
",1542239,Leela," Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!
",462240,Hermes,"  Faster!
",102241,Leela," It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.
",592242,Fry," Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!
",572243,Hermes," No one, except a legendary limbo champion.
",442244,Labarbara," Oh, Hermes!
",132245,Hermes," Ooh! It's been a while.  This one is for that little kid who's limbo-ing up in heaven right now.
",982246,Labarbara," That's my man, alright, baby, limbo!
",382247,Hermes," I still got the moves! Zoidberg, lower the door another inch.
",632248,Labarbara," Just go on through and hit the release, you hot dog!
",542249,Hermes," Yes, dear.
",122250,Labarbara," That's my man!
",162251,Amy," Yay, Hermes!
",142252,Hermes," Uh, can somebody help me up?
",302253,Countess," Well, now what are we going to do?
",362254,Bender," Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?
",552255,Countess," By God, you're right! I'm a class-3 yacht.
",442256,Farnsworth," Thank God there are plenty of escape pods. We won't have to dress up like women and children.
",952257,Leela," We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must be slowing down his looting.
",1022258,Mrs. Wong," Amy!
",62259,Amy," Mom? Dad? You're alive!
",252260,Leo," Yeah, but so what? The important thing is we found you a new man.
",672261,Mrs. Wong," A captain.
",122262,Amy," Uh, Mom, I don't--  Hi!
",252263,Kif,"  Hello!
",92264,Farnsworth," I don't feel well!
",202265,Fry," Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment when we almost--  Never mind!
",1032266,Hermes," Everyone else is off the ship. Where in Babylon is Bender?
",602267,Leela," I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.
",452268,Fry," Goodbye, Bender.
",182269,Bender,"  Wait for us!
",152270,Leela," Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.
",542271,Amy," Well, it's not me!
",202272,Fry," Look!
",72273,Countess," I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too strong!
",472274,Bender," I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!
",522275,Countess," No! You have too much to live for. It may hurt for a while but one day you'll share your love again. After all, it's shareware.
",1292276,Bender," Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.
",672277,Countess,"  Farewell!
",122278,Bender,"  No!
",62279,Bender," She's gone.
",132280,Leela," But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away.
",752281,Fry," Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?
",1522282,Farnsworth," Oh, yes, absolutely!  Not a chance!
",372283,Bender," At least I'll always have her bracelet!  What do you think it's worth?
",722284,Hermes," It's fake, mon!
",172285,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone.  We've got a very special delivery today.
",642286,Fry," Who's it going to?
",202287,Farnsworth," Me.
",52288,Bender," Another job well done.
",242289,Farnsworth," No, I need it shipped to my office at Mars University.  It's a little experiment that may well win me the Nobel Prize.
",1202290,Leela," In what field?
",162291,Farnsworth," I don't care, they all pay the same.
",382292,Fry," Is it dangerous?
",182293,Farnsworth," Oh, my, no.  Off we go!
",252294,Fry," Very impressive. Back in the 20th century we had no idea there was a university on Mars.
",902295,Farnsworth," Well, in those days Mars was just a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it was eventually made livable, when the university was founded in 2636.
",1802296,Leela," They planted traditional college foliage; ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the whole planet was terraformed.
",1002297,Fry," Does that mean it's safe to breathe the air?
",462298,Farnsworth," Of course.
",122299,Farnsworth," Over here is Wong Library. It has the largest collection of literature in the Western Universe.
",972300,Bender,"  Hey, look! There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity, Epsilon Rho Rho.
",762301,Leela," You went to college?
",222302,Bender," Of course. I'm a bender, I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending.
",752303,Fry," What was your minor?
",222304,Bender," Robo-American Studies.
",242305,Fratbot #1," Are you here to fumigate the moose head?
",422306,Bender," Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from way back.
",482307,Fratbot #1," Eh, close enough. C'mon in.
",292308,Bender," Thanks. Here's your finger back.
",342309,Bender," All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.
",482310,Fratbot #2," Mate in 143 moves.
",202311,Fratbot #3," Oh, pooh. You win again!
",262312,Bender," Uh-oh, nerds!
",152313,Fratbot #1," Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Gearshift, chapter president. This is Oily, and this here is Fat-bot.
",1052314,Bender," You're all losers. My name's Bender.
",382315,Oily," Bender from Bending State Bender? Wow, you're a legend around here!
",692316,Fat-bot," I heard that in one single night you drank a whole keg, streaked across campus and crammed 58 humans into a phone booth.
",1222317,Bender,"  Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going.
",692318,Gearshift," No, Bender, wait. We're the lamest frat on campus. Even Hillel has better parties than us. Please, you've gotta stay and teach us how to be cool.
",1472319,Bender," Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie and a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder.
",1212320,Fat-bot," Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
",282321,Fry," I tell you, being here really takes me back to my college days.
",652322,Man #1," Step right up. Who wants to learn physics?
",442323,Man #1 #2,"  Keep your hands inside the car at all times.
",472324,Fry," Good old Coney Island College! Go, Whitefish!
",472325,Leela," Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but you don't seem like the educated type.
",802326,Fry," Oh, yeah?  Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout.
",632327,Leela," Please! Everyone knows 20th century colleges were basically expensive daycare centres.
",882328,Farnsworth," That's true. By current academic standards, you're merely a high school dropout.
",822329,Fry," What? That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college dropout gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out all over again!
",1612330,Leela," You won't last two weeks.
",272331,Fry," Aww, thanks for believing in me.
",342332,Amy," Yo, classmate. What you takin'?
",332333,Fry," Oh, I don't know.  Hey, Professor, what are you teaching this semester?
",732334,Farnsworth," Same thing I teach every semester: The Mathematics of Quantum Neutrino Fields. I made up the title so that no student would dare take it.
",1392335,Fry,"  Mathematics of wanton burrito meals.  I'll be there!
",552336,Farnsworth," Please, Fry, I don't know how to teach; I'm a professor!
",582337,Fry," See you in class!
",192338,Farnsworth," Oh!
",52339,Fat-bot," This is gonna be great!
",252340,Bender,"  Bingo!
",92341,Fat-bot,"  Oh, mama!
",122342,Bender,"  Oh, yeah! Someone's been a bad computer!  Get a load of that!
",642343,Meiderneyer," I say, you've damaged our servants' quarters ... and our servants.
",682344,Chet," This time Robot House has gone too far.
",412345,Bender," Cheese it!
",122346,Fat-bot,"  They're gonna catch us!
",262347,Fry," Hey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, two chairs, a couple of beds.  A woodpecker.
",882348,Leela," I think that's probably your roommate.
",402349,Fry," Oh, right, cool.  C'mon in, roomie!   What the--?
",512350,Monkey," I call top bunk!
",182351,Fry," My roommate's a monkey?
",252352,Monkey,"  Brilliant deduction, you're a credit to your species.
",562353,Farnsworth," Ah, Fry, I see you've met Guenter!
",362354,Fry," You know each other?
",222355,Farnsworth," Guenter is my experiment. He was the top secret contents of this stinking crate.
",822356,Guenter," I'd rather live in a crate than share a room with this dork.
",622357,Leela," So what makes Guenter talk?
",292358,Fry," Is he genetically engineered?
",312359,Farnsworth," Oh, please! That's preposterous science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's intelligence actually lies in his electronium hat which harnesses the power of sunspots to produce cognitive radiation.
",1922360,Guenter," You're wasting your breath, Professor. He'll never understand a word of it.
",772361,Fry," I understood the word ""hat""!
",302362,Farnsworth," Please, stop bickering. I arranged that you be roommates for a reason: So I'd only have to remember one phone number. Now shake hands and make up.
",1482363,Fry," You want a banana?
",202364,Guenter," I don't eat bananas. I prefer banana-flavoured energy bars made from tofu.
",762365,Fry," I don't like you.
",192366,Fry," This is gonna be a cakewalk!
",302367,Teacher," Welcome to the history of the 20th century. Look to your left, then to your right. Then in nine other directions. One of the 12 of you will not pass this class.
",1622368,Amy," Boring.  Let's hear about Walter Mondale already!
",512369,Teacher," Be forewarned: The only sure way to get an A in this class is to have lived in the 20th century.
",982370,Fry," Swish!
",82371,Teacher," You were saying, Mr. Fry?
",272372,Fry," I'm from the 20th century. Go ahead, ask me anything.
",552373,Teacher," Very well. What device invented in the 20th century allowed people to view broadcast programmes in their own homes?
",1172374,Fry," Ooh ... I know this ... whatyya call it? Lite Brite!
",542375,Guenter," I believe the answer is the television.
",412376,Teacher," Very good, Mr. ...  ... Guenter.
",342377,Amy,"  Wow! Smart and cute!
",232378,Vernon," What I love about being dean of students is the peace and quiet and the respect I receive.  Now what's all this about?
",1202379,Woman #1,"  Dean Vernon, the students from Robot House are here.
",552380,Vernon," Robot House!
",142381,Bender," Hey, dean, nice looking model.
",322382,Vernon," You keep away from it. You robots are a disgrace to this university. Whenever a fire alarm is pulled, it's Robot House. Whenever the campus liquor store is looted, Robot House. Whenever a human corpse is desecrated--
",2182383,Bender," Now, I can explain that.
",262384,Vernon," That's enough out of you. From this day forth, Robot House is on dodecatupple-secret probation!
",972385,Bender," No fair!
",102386,Fat-bot," My mom is gonna kill me!
",262387,Vernon," Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to the one thing that's kept me sane these past eight years: My model ship.
",1222388,Gearshift," Fat-bot! No!
",142389,Fat-bot," When I get nervous I get hungry.
",342390,Bender," Cheese it!
",122391,Vernon,"  Robot House!
",152392,Fry," So, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it off. If you're not doing anything later might I escort you to a kegger?
",1112393,Chrissy," Not even if you were the last man on Mars.
",442394,Guenter,"  Hey! You like bananas?
",252395,Guenter,"  I got her number. How do you like them bananas?
",502396,Farnsworth," And therefore, by process of elimination, the electron must taste like grapeade.
",822397,Fry," Sorry, I overslept.
",212398,Farnsworth," Until 5pm?
",122399,Fry," It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept me up all night with his constant thinking. Just thinking and thinking. He's trying to make me look like an idiot.
",1522400,Farnsworth," Don't be jealous. Without his special hat, Guenter might be no more intelligent than you.
",912401,Fry," I hate that rodent!
",212402,Farnsworth," Fry, that monkey is my most important experiment. If you two don't stop fighting I'll have you both neutered.
",1112403,Fry," That'll show him.
",192404,Amy," Dean Vernon, I'd like you to meet my parents, Leo and Inez.
",612405,Vernon," Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Wong, I'm so glad we could admit Amy in exchange for your generous contribution.
",992406,Leo," How much more for Phi Beta Kappa?
",352407,Vernon," How much you got?
",192408,Guenter," Sorry I'm late, I was off at a study session ... with Chrissy!
",642409,Farnsworth," Oh, I'm glad you made it, Guenter because in honour of parents weekend I have a special surprise for you.
",1072410,Guenter,"  Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?  This is so humiliating.
",622411,Fry," Now these monkeys I like!  What's that? You wanna come out?
",612412,Guenter," No! Stop!
",112413,Chet," I say.
",82414,Farnsworth," What's that they're flinging at us?
",372415,Guenter," Oh, dear Lord! All over the dean!
",352416,Fry," Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get up on the chandelier with your parents and I'll take a picture?
",1012417,Bender," Well, looks like the party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fat-bot some action.
",1072418,Fat-bot," It's my first time, I'm really nervous.
",412419,Vernon,"  Robot House!
",152420,Leela," What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school special, I think we learned who the real animal was today.
",1402421,Fry," You mean peer pressure?
",252422,Fry," Look out! He's got a gun!
",272423,Guenter,"  Leave me alone.
",182424,Leela," Hey, what's going on? I thought you didn't like bananas.
",582425,Guenter,"  Of course I do. I try so hard to fit in but seeing my parents act like that made me realise I'm just a primitive beast.
",1222426,Fry," Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns out like their parents. I mean, look at me. My folks were honest, hard-working people.
",1272427,Leela," Besides, Guenter, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat.
",702428,Guenter,"  So what? I mean, sure, it looks cool and it makes me smart but it doesn't make me happy.
",912429,Leela," That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry.
",542430,Guenter,"  They can't. It's all the hat.
",322431,Fry," Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable here, maybe you should just go back to the jungle.
",902432,Guenter," The jungle. But I couldn't do that to the Professor. I'm his prize experiment, and he's like a father to me.
",1102433,Leela," But he's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father.
",712434,Farnsworth," Look at him. I'm so proud.
",282435,Fry," Thanks, Professor!
",202436,Farnsworth," Not you.
",102437,Fry,"  Ow!
",62438,Student," Hey!
",62439,Farnsworth," Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why? Why? Why didn't I break his legs?
",882440,Farnsworth,"  Oh, poor Guenter.
",202441,Leela," So he just ran away in the middle of the exam?
",482442,Farnsworth," I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with faeces. He tied with Fry.
",842443,Fry," I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.
",752444,Farnsworth," You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain?
",652445,Fry," Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force Guenter to be a human but he's an animal. He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles. Now that's entertainment!
",1822446,Farnsworth," But Guenter's obviously better off being intelligent. Tell him, Leela.
",722447,Leela," Nuh-uh, I'm staying out of this. Now here's my opinion: What we should do is...
",812448,Farnsworth," What?
",72449,Leela," I said we'll go to the jungle and let Guenter decide once and for all.
",722450,Farnsworth," What?
",72451,Vernon," You all know the rules. Whichever house wins the regatta becomes head of the Greek Council. And should that house currently be on any type of multiple secret probation, it will be lifted and I will be forced to serve as Grand Marshal of a parade honouring them.
",2632452,Chet," I say, Robot House, your water craft is as ill-designed as you yourselves.
",762453,Meiderneyer," Good one, Chet!
",172454,Bender," Oh, yeah? Watch this!
",232455,Chet," Well, I never!
",162456,Vernon," Fraternities, on your marks.
",302457,Bender," Hey!
",62458,Fry," Wow! The jungles on Mars look just like the jungles on Earth.
",632459,Farnsworth," Jungles? On Earth?
",202460,Leela," I see some movement up there. I think it's him.
",492461,Farnsworth," Stand back.
",132462,Leela," Oops.
",72463,Farnsworth," Don't worry. They'll be fine once the tranquiliser wears off.
",632464,Fry," There's our man!
",182465,Leela," Professor, you'll offer Guenter the hat and, Fry, you'll offer him the banana.  We'll let him choose whether he wants to be intelligent or just a mindless animal.
",1642466,Farnsworth," Come on, Guenter, take the hat.
",332467,Fry," No, the banana, the banana!
",292468,Farnsworth," Consider the philosophical and metaphysical ramifications of the--
",682469,Fry," Banana, banana, banana!
",252470,Leela," Wait, what's that sound?
",262471,Gearshift,"  Hey, Bender, you sure this is a short-cut?
",452472,Bender,"  Not as sure as I was an hour ago!
",362473,Vernon," And the winner is ...  ... Robot House?
",412474,Farnsworth," Oh, dear Lord!
",162475,Leela," No! No!
",92476,Farnsworth," Thank God this log is sturdy.   Put on the hat, Guenter! You're the only one who can save us!   Stupid monkey.
",1122477,Fry,"  No.
",62478,Leela,"  Not there.
",132479,Farnsworth,"  Keep trying.
",152480,Guenter," Eureka! The hat goes on the head. It's all so obvious now!
",602481,Leela,"  Help us, Guenter!
",202482,Guenter," Oh, my goodness.  Hang on. I need to do some calculations.  Got it!  Grab on!
",792483,Farnsworth," We're saved!
",142484,Fry," 'Preciate it, Guenter!
",242485,Leela," Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the vine. You can still save yourself.
",732486,Guenter," Why bother? I've got nothing to live for. I was miserable as a genius, and as a monkey, I was so dumb I tried to wear a hat on my butt.   There's just no place for me in this world.  Although, on the other hand--
",2142487,Farnsworth," Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Well, let's go gather him up. There's no sense letting him go to waste.
",1022488,Fry," Guenter! You're alive!
",242489,Guenter," I guess the hat must have broke my fall.
",422490,Farnsworth," It seems to be working at only half-capacity, but I can fix it.
",652491,Guenter," No, wait! I like it like this. I actually feel sort of happy.
",632492,Farnsworth," But what about your super-intelligence?
",412493,Guenter," When I had that there was too much pressure to use it. All I want out of life is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit. That's why I've decided to transfer to business school!
",1962494,Farnsworth,"  Nooo!
",82495,Bender,"  Come on, everyone! Big party in Robot House!
",472496,Fry," Pizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real TV station, huh?
",572497,Technician," Well, it's a Fox affiliate.
",292498,Fry," What are you showing right now?
",332499,Technician," Single Female Lawyer. It's the season finale. Wanna watch?
",602500,Fry," Ah, I dunno. That's a chick show. I prefer programmes of the genre ""world's blankiest blank"".
",952501,Technician," She is wearing the world's shortiest skirt.
",452502,Fry," I'm in!
",92503,Judge #1,"  Counselor, I remind you that it's unethical to sleep with your client. If you really care about the outcome of the case, you should sleep with me.
",1492504,Single Female Lawyer,"  Your Honour, it's bad enough to proposition a single female lawyer in court, but this is a unisex bathroom.
",1102505,Judge #1,"  Overruled, counselor!
",242506,Stenographer,"  Could you repeat that last part?
",352507,Technician," Oh, my God! You've knocked Fox of the air!
",442508,Fry," Pft! Like anyone on Earth cares.
",342509,Stenographer,"  Could you repeat that last par--
",352510,Lrrr," This is an outrage! I demand to know what happened to the plucky lawyer and her compellingly short garment.
",1092511,Announcer #1,"  Due to technical difficulties, we now bring you eight animated shows in a row.
",812512,Hermes," What in the name of Bob Marley's ghost? Get to work, you lazy boat bag!
",732513,Bender," Ow!
",52514,Fry," Ow! Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor Day.
",432515,Hermes," Labor Day? That phoney-baloney holiday crammed down our throats by fat-cat union gangsters?
",932516,Fry," That's the one.
",172517,Hermes," Hot damn, a day off!
",222518,Leela," Who's up for one last summer beach trip?
",422519,Bender," Aw, yeah!
",112520,Hermes," Ready, Freddy!
",162521,Fry,"  Eh, I think I'll just stay here.
",352522,Leela," Fry, you're wasting your life sitting in front of that TV. You need to get out and see the real world.
",1042523,Fry," But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world!
",672524,Leela," Everyone's too polite to say anything but you're covered with bed sores.
",742525,Fry," Not covered!
",142526,Leela," Just get in the car.
",222527,Farnsworth," Ah, here we are: Monument Beach!
",342528,Fry," Wait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I didn't know they were both in New York!
",952529,Leela," They are now. In the 2600's, New Yorkers elected a super-villain governor, and he stole most of the world's monuments.
",1202530,Bender," Truly a great man. Look at him up there.
",422531,Hermes," Aha!  Found you!
",182532,Bender," OK, now you go hide.  Nice knowin' you.
",412533,Farnsworth," Come on, Zoidberg, I passed it right to you.
",462534,Zoidberg," I've had it with this game! I'm going for a scuttle!
",542535,Bender," OK, everyone, come and get it!
",322536,Fry," Ah, just like my dad used to make ... until McDonald's fired him.
",672537,Bender," Bite my red-hot glowing ass.  Wait a minute. Red-hot glowing ass?   I'll be right back!  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!  Aw, yeah!
",1372538,Amy," No, Nibbler!   Psst, Professor, I need another bikini.
",562539,Farnsworth," Eh ... wha?  Oh, oh, OK, I think there's one can left.  Oh, my.
",652540,Amy," There. How do I look?
",232541,Farnsworth," Like a cheap French harlot.
",292542,Amy," French?
",92543,Bully," Say, doll-face, how'd you like to make time with a real man?
",622544,Leela," No. I'm not attracted to bullies. No matter how big and ...  ... handsome they are.
",852545,Fry," It's OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot of work to do.
",542546,Bully," Uh, sir, you don't understand. I'm a professional beach bully. I pretend to steal your girl, you punch me, I go down, she swoons, you slip me 50 bucks.
",1532547,Fry," 50 bucks? Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her.
",602548,Leela," Fry! Although I suppose we could go for a walk along the beach.
",652549,Bully," Uh, no thanks, ma'am, I'm actually gay.
",412550,Zoidberg," Uh-oh.  Help! Help!  Bender, you gotta spring me. I'll never survive in here; I'm too pretty!
",952551,Bender," Alright, alright, I'll bust you out.  Cheese it!
",502552,Fry," Voila. The greatest sandcastle ever built. This is the kind of castle King Arthur would have lived in, if he were a fiddler crab.
",1312553,Leela," It's very nice. We should get a picture before the tide comes in.
",672554,Fry," Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?
",342555,Bender," Right here, buddy.  Wait, I wanna be in the picture too.  Pretend you're happy.
",812556,Zoidberg," Yay!
",62557,Leela," Oh, my God!
",132558,Hermes," What in Babylon?
",182559,Fry,"  Nooo!
",82560,Hermes," Faster!
",92561,Fry," We're all gonna die, aren't we?
",332562,Farnsworth," Oh, I should think so. Although last time aliens invaded all they did was force the most intelligent of us to pair off and mate continuously.  Oh, yes!
",1532563,Linda,"  Once again, today's winning lotto number was 4. In other news, alien saucers continue to rain destruction upon Earth. We now go live to an emergency address by Earth President McNeal.
",1862564,McNeal,"  Ladies and gentlemen, our course is clear. The time has come to knuckle under. To get down on all fours and really lick boot. Give our alien masters whatever they want a--
",1742565,Lrrr,"  People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.  Is this thing on?  Now then: We want the one you call ""McNeal"". Give us McNeal or we will lay waste to your cities with our anti-monument laser. We demand McNeal!
",2252566,McNeal,"  Uh, as I was saying ...  ... mankind would sooner perish than kowtow to outrageous alien demands for this McNeal ... whoever he is. Am I right?  And now, the man who will lead us in our proud struggle for freedom, fresh from his bloody triumph over the pacifists of the Gandhi Nebula, 25-star General Zapp Brannigan!
",3192567,Man #1,"  Yeah!
",82568,Bender," Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic windbag you slept with.
",612569,Leela," The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?
",612570,Bender," Evidently not.
",162571,Zapp,"  Call me cocky, but if there's an alien out there I can't kill, I haven't met him and killed him yet. But I can't go it alone.  That's why I'm ordering every available ship to report for duty. Anyone without a ship should secure a weapon and fire wildly into the air.
",2692572,Leela," Well, you heard the windbag: We've been drafted. Everyone into the ship.
",742573,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse to fight. I'm a conscientious objector.
",832574,Fry," A what?
",92575,Bender," You know, a coward.
",212576,Zapp,"  Since this is an emergency, all robots will now have their patriotism circuits activated.
",922577,Bender," It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity.  Oh, crap!
",802578,Zapp," We're all from different cultures here. Some of you are white, some of you are black.  You're brown.  And you're silver. But I don't care if your skin's red or tan or Chinese. You're all going to have to learn to die together.  Am I right, soldier?
",2502579,Bender," Well, actually, I--  Sir, yes, sir! Sir!
",422580,Zapp," Remember, our mission is simple: Destroy all aliens!
",542581,Kif," Um, uh, not me, sir.
",222582,Zapp," Oh, yes, right. Nobody destroy Kif.  Unless you have to.   Oh, ho, ho! The luscious Captain Leela.  This is turning into one very sex-ay struggle for the future of the human race!
",1812583,Leela," Thanks, but I'm not technically human.
",402584,Zapp," Right, right. Nobody destroy Leela either.
",442585,Zapp," The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well-made bed. You will practise until you can make your bed in your sleep.
",1282586,Fry," You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
",362587,Zapp," You won't have time for sleeping, soldier. Not with all the bed-making you'll be doing.
",892588,Zapp," The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.  Now, like all great plans, my strategy is so simple an idiot could have devised it. On my command, all ships will line up and file directly into the alien death cannons, clogging them with wreckage.
",3382589,Fry," W-Wouldn't it make more sense to send the robots in first a--
",632590,Bender," Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission.  Aw, cut it out!
",582591,Zapp," You're a brave robot, son. But when I'm in command every mission's a suicide mission. Which reminds me.  Leela, perhaps before we head into battle you'd like to make love to me, in case one of us doesn't come back.
",2162592,Leela," Maybe we should wait till afterwards, in case neither of us comes back.
",732593,Zapp," Here's hoping.
",162594,Fry," I'm gonna be a science-fiction hero, just like Uhura, or Captain Janeway, or Xena!
",842595,Leela,"  Fry, this isn't TV, it's real life. Can't you tell the difference?
",692596,Fry," Sure, I just like TV better.
",302597,Leela," Bender, damage report.
",242598,Bender," The auxiliary power's out, and they spilled my cocktail.
",582599,Fry," Alright, scumwads. This one's for Bender's cocktail!
",542600,Leela," We did it! We won!
",202601,Bender,"  Yeah, but it'll never bring back my martini.   Well, who wants a martini?
",762602,Zapp,"  Good work, everyone. The mothership is destroyed.
",522603,Zapp," What the hell is that thing?
",302604,Kif," It appears to be the mothership.
",342605,Zapp," Then what did we just blow up?
",322606,Kif," The Hubble Telescope.
",232607,Zapp,"  Stop exploding, you cowards!
",312608,Leela," This is hopeless.  If we're gonna get blown to bits, we might as well do it in the comfort of our own home.
",1092609,Farnsworth," You'll be the captain, you'll be the delivery boy, and you'll be the alcoholic, foul-mouthed--  Oh, God, you're alive. I mean, thank God you're alive!  Sorry, check back in three days, a week at the most.
",2062610,Lrrr,"  We want McNeal! Stop stalling!
",332611,Linda,"  And now a rebuttal from President McNeal.
",442612,McNeal,"  The people of Earth remain united in my refusal to hand over myself. Total annihilation is a small price to pay compared with--
",1302613,Zapp,"  Here he is! Come and get him!
",322614,Lrrr," You are not McNeal.
",212615,Zapp,"  Huh?
",72616,McNeal,"  Huh?
",72617,Ndnd," You are not the one we want.
",302618,McNeal,"  Oh, thank you. Thank you, glorious masters! I--
",502619,Lrrr," Give us McNeal!
",172620,Zapp," That was McNeal.
",182621,Ndnd," No, McNeal, the single female lawyer.
",392622,Lrrr," She wears miniskirts and is promiscuous.
",422623,Zapp,"  Really?
",102624,Fry," Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.
",352625,Lrrr," Surely you know McNeal. She is an unmarried human female struggling to succeed in a human male's world.
",1052626,Zapp," Maybe that's just her excuse for being incompetent.
",532627,Lrrr,"  Silence!  We will accept no more decoys.  This is the McNeal.
",642628,Fry," Wait, I know her.
",192629,Leela," You do not, you big fat liar. You don't know anyone. All you do is watch TV.
",782630,Fry," That's where I know her from. She's Jenny McNeal. She was a character on a TV show back in the 20th century, Single Female Lawyer.
",1322631,Bender," Well if they're hoping to see a TV show that hasn't existed for a thousand years, pft, they are royally boned.
",1122632,Lrrr,"  We will raise your planet's temperature by one million degrees a day, for five days, unless we see McNeal at 9pm tomorrow -- 8 central!
",1382633,Farnsworth,"  I'm beginning to think there'll be no forced mating at all.
",622634,Leela," They're going to destroy the entire Earth if they don't see some stupid TV show about some bimbo lawyer?
",1062635,Fry," It's crazy! How could they even know about a show from a thousand years ago?
",782636,Farnsworth," Well, Omicron Persei 8 is about a thousand light years away. So the electro-magnetic waves would just recently have gotten there. You see--
",1412637,Fry," Magic. Got it.
",162638,Amy," Check this out: Back in 1999 the season finale of Single Female Lawyer was interrupted by technical problems. Apparently some zidiot spilled Coke on the transmitter.
",1672639,Fry," Beer-- I would think.
",232640,Bender," They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.
",782641,Amy," There aren't any copies left.
",312642,Farnsworth," No, there wouldn't be. Most videotapes from that era were damaged in 2443 during the Second Coming of Jesus.
",1102643,Fry," Y'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of that episode. If I could make up an ending, maybe we could act it out ourselves.
",1202644,Zoidberg," I could make the costumes.
",282645,Farnsworth," I have an old five-megawatt broadcasting tower in the attic.
",622646,Bender,"  And I, I could be an acting coach!
",372647,Fry," Let's put on a show.
",222648,Fry," OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--
",422649,Leela," Uh-uh, forget it. A, I'm camera shy; and B, I get tongue tied in front of an audience armed with death rays.
",1102650,Amy," Plus, you don't really have the thighs for a miniskirt.
",572651,Leela," Gimme the script.
",192652,Fry," Places, everyone.
",192653,Amy," OK ... all set!
",172654,Fry," Lights!  Camera one!  Camera two!  Camera three!
",502655,Lrrr," Prepare the water cooler, that we may gather around it later and discuss things.
",822656,Bender,"  Single Female Lawyer,
Fighting for her client,
Wearing sexy miniskirts,
",742657,Bender,"  And being self-reliant.
 Hey, I'm pretty good!
",492658,Farnsworth," Uh ...  ... Jenny McNeal, you are charged with jury-tampering in last week's case ...  ... on account of your hot, naked affair with the foreman. How do you plead?
",1652659,Leela,"  Your Honour, I move for a mistrial, on the grounds that I'm also having a hot, naked affair with the foreman of this jury.
",1252660,Hermes,"  I'll see you during the recess!
",342661,Lrrr," If McNeal wishes to be taken seriously why does she not simply tear the judge's head off?
",912662,Ndnd," It is true what they say; ""Women are from Omicron Persei 7, men are from Omicron Persei 9"".
",932663,Farnsworth,"  Your witness, Prosecutor Ramirez.
",362664,Zoidberg," Gracias.  Single Female Lawyer, where were you on the night of August 23rd?
",772665,Leela," Sleeping with you.
",202666,Zoidberg," Aha!
",62667,Leela," Uh, g-- uh, getting back to the, uh, matter, uh-uh, if it please the court...  Fry, there's nothing else here. You only wrote two pages of dialogue.
",1502668,Fry," Well, it took an hour to write. I thought it would take an hour to read.
",742669,Leela," What are we supposed to do now?
",332670,Fry," I don't know, I don't know. Just say anything. As long as it's compelling, mesmerising, a tour de force.
",1062671,Leela," Uh...
",72672,Farnsworth,"  What say you, Single Female Lawyer?
",382673,Leela," I say ... I'm giving up the law.  And I'm giving up being single. Your Honour, will you marry me?
",992674,Fry," No, no! Go to commercial!
",272675,Bender," We'll be back after this word from Crazy Bender's Discount Stereo.
",682676,Fry," Married? Jenny can't get married.
",352677,Leela," Why not? It's clever, it's unexpected.
",402678,Fry," But that's not why people watch TV. Clever things make people feel stupid, and unexpected things make them feel scared.
",1212679,Lrrr," Â : Attention, McNeal. Your unexpected marriage plan scares us. You stole our hearts as a single female lawyer, and so shall you remain -- or else!
",1482680,Fry," You see? TV audiences don't want anything original. They wanna see the same thing they've seen a thousand times before.
",1212681,Bender,"  Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Fry?
",312682,Fry," Trust me on this. While other people were out living their lives, I wasted mine watching TV, because deep down I knew it might one day help me save the world. Plus, I would have lost my Workman's Comp if I had gone outside. Now just read these cue cards.
",2562683,Fry," And action!
",132684,Farnsworth,"  Miss McNeal, I'm afraid I must decline your offer of marriage. For, you see, I'm dying. Cough, then fall over dead.
",1182685,Zoidberg,"  My God, he's dead.
",212686,Leela,"  I will now make my closing statement. With my fiancÃ© deceased ...  ... I hereby return to my single female lawyer career. No matter what any man says.
",1532687,Hermes," We find the defendant vulnerable yet spunky!
",462688,Zoidberg,"  Hooray!
",102689,Amy,"  Hooray!
",102690,Fry," And ... cut!
",142691,Bender,"  Single Female Lawyer,
Having lot's of sex--
 Huh?
",522692,Lrrr,"  Attention, McNeal. We are reasonably satisfied with the events we have seen. Overall I would rate it a C+, OK, not great.  As a result, we will not destroy your planet. But neither will we provide you with our recipe for immortality.
",2362693,Fry," Way to overact ,Zoidberg!
",272694,Lrrr,"  And now we must return to our planet, to catch the end of a thousand-year-old Leno monologue.
",962695,Bender," You did it, Fry!
",182696,Fry," Yep.  It was just a matter of knowing the secret of all TV shows: At the end of the episode, everything's always right back to normal.
",1362697,Calculon,"  Honey unit, I'm home.  Monique!
",342698,Monique,"  Calculon!
",122699,Calculon,"  Oh, how I wish I could believe that. You may be my evil half-brother, but there's no law against murdering the other half.
",1252700,Announcer #1 #1,"  All My Circuits will be right back after this word from...
",612701,Announcer #1 #2,"  Slurm! It's highly addictive!
",322702,Trixie,"  Look! It's Slurms MacKenzie!
",312703,Dixie,"  He's the original party worm!
",322704,Slurms,"  Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Let's party!
",402705,Bender," Look at that worm go. Who says there are no more heroes?
",582706,Slurms,"  Hey, dudes, you can win a chance to party with me, Slurms MacKenzie, at the Slurm bottling plant on planet Wormulon!
",1192707,Announcer #1 #2,"  Just look for the winning bottle-cap inside specially-marked cans of Slurm.
",782708,Trixie," I won!
",82709,Announcer #1 #2,"  No purchase necessary unless you wish to enter the contest. Odds of winning mathematically insignificant.
",1082710,Fry," I like those odds.  Rats. Just another tooth.
",472711,Fry," I gotta find that golden bottle-cap.
",382712,Leela," I've never seen anyone so addicted to Slurm.
",462713,Fry," This is nothing. Back in high school I used to drink a hundred cans of cola a week. Right up until my third heart attack.
",1232714,Leela," Bender, what's wrong?
",232715,Bender," I'm sick.
",112716,Leela," You poor baby. Let me check if you have a fever.  Ow!
",552717,Farnsworth," According to Bender's temperature gauge, which I suggest you use next time, Leela, he's running a fever of ... 900 degrees.
",1252718,Hermes," Bender, mon, lie yourself down.  You're payin' for that!
",582719,Zoidberg," I'll have a look, but I remind you, I'm an expert on humans not robots.
",732720,Fry," I'm not Bender, I'm Fry.
",262721,Zoidberg," Really? I though you were the robot.
",382722,Fry," Nope. Human.
",142723,Zoidberg," Alright, alright, spare me your life story.  Now what seems to be the trouble?
",802724,Bender," My tummy hurts and I've been having this burning electrical discharge.
",722725,Zoidberg," Hmm. Don't worry, you'll be fine.   Oh boy.  I didn't have the heart to tell him: It's fin fungus. He'll be floating upside-down by morning.
",1422726,Amy," You should try homeopathic medicine, Bender. Take some zinc.
",622727,Bender," I'm 40% zinc.
",152728,Amy," Then take some Echinacea or a St. John's wort.
",482729,Farnsworth," Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same crap.
",472730,Leela," Hey, what's rattling around in there?
",392731,Farnsworth," It may well be the cause of Bender's illness. But more importantly, it's a flimsy pretext to try out my latest invention. To the laboratory!
",1422732,Farnsworth," I call this the F-ray. It's like an X-ray only it allows you to see through anything, even metal. Now, the neutrino beam it emits is a tad dangerous, so you'll all need protective goggles.  You may feel a slight stinging sensation -- all of you!  Aha! There's the cause of your illness.
",2882733,Amy," Hey, that's my watch!
",232734,Bender," I was wondering where I put that.  Hey, now I feel much better! Thanks, Professor. And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch.
",1232735,Farnsworth," Well, I've got to go take this suit to the decontaminators. You two lock up the F-ray and for the love of God don't let it fall into the wrong hands.
",1512736,Bender," What should we point it at first?
",352737,Fry," I 'unno. Try it on me.  Ow! My sperm!
",392738,Bender," Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?
",382739,Fry," Huh, didn't hurt that time.
",292740,Bender," Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady.
",362741,Fry," What's wrong?
",152742,Bender," That's no lady!
",172743,Fembot #1," Damn Chico! One more upgrade and I'll be more lady than you can handle! Why you so stupid, stupid?
",1002744,Bender," Hey, bite my shiny metal ass!
",312745,Fembot #1," You couldn't afford it, honey.
",322746,Fry," All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty.  Ah, if only there was some way of knowing which can had the winning bottle-cap inside.
",1522747,Bender," Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was too busy using this F-ray to look inside of things.
",912748,Fry," Wait a second. I'm getting an idea. N-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Wait. No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. Yes!
",1182749,Bender," Ah, this thing stinks.
",242750,Fry," We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and all we won was this junk.  I never wanna see another can of Slurm again. Man, am I thirsty.
",1292751,Leela," Fry, are you alright?
",232752,Bender," You did it, Fry! You found the winning bottle-cap! We won!
",602753,Fry,"  Hooray!
",102754,Leela," Ooh, look at that!
",202755,Bender," Hey!
",62756,Glurmo," Welcome to the planet Wormulon. I'm Glurmo, your golly-rific guide to the splend-tacular Slurm factory.
",1052757,Fry," Uh-huh. Can we have our free Slurm now?
",412758,Glurmo," You'll have all the Slurm you can drink later on when you're partying with my good friend, Slurms MacKenzie.
",1102759,Slurms," Alright! Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Lay some skin on me, dudes!
",632760,Bender," Wow! The original party worm!  Are you ready to get down, get funky with us?
",782761,Glurmo," He'd better be, that's what we pay him for. Right, Slurms?
",602762,Slurms," Right!
",82763,Glurmo," In fact, Slurms has to party all night, every night, or he's fired!
",692764,Slurms,"  Rock on!
",112765,Glurmo," But before the party, you're all in for a fun-derful treat: A VIP tour of the Slurm factory!
",942766,Slurms," Enjoy the tour, dudes!  I'm gonna go lie down.
",482767,Glurmo," Welcome, my friends, to the wondrous world of whimsy that we like to call ""Slurms Centralised Industrial Fabrication Unit"".
",1252768,Farnsworth," Oh, my!
",92769,Bender," Look! Flowers! And a boat!
",282770,Farnsworth," Who are those horrible orange creatures over there?
",532771,Glurmo," Why, those are the Grunka Lunkas. They work here in the Slurm factory.
",722772,Farnsworth," Tell them I hate them.
",242773,Glurmo," As we sail down the river of Slurm you'll see our mix-ologists at work.  They take 900 of the finest ingredients, add a touch of child-like delight and mix it all with glacial spring water from our glacial spring water generator.  Then, last of all, we add the secret ingredient that makes Slurm so deliciously addictive.
",3232774,Fry," So, what's the secret ingredient?
",352775,Glurmo," It's whatever your imagination wants it to be.
",482776,Fry," Oh. But what is it really?
",282777,Glurmo,"  That's not for you to know.  Now, over here the Grunka Lunkas are inducing Wumpus berries to release their flavour, using sensual massage.
",1412778,Bender,"  Psst, those berries. Those are the secret ingredient, right?
",632779,Glurmo," No.
",52780,Bender," You positive?
",152781,Glurmo," Yes.
",62782,Bender," I'm just asking cause they look kind of secret.
",492783,Glurmo," Enough! There will be no further questions.
",452784,Fry," Why?
",62785,Leela," Hey, look! The disgusting little men are starting to sing.
",602786,Grunka Lunkas,"  Grunka Lunka dunkity-do,
We've got a friendly warning for you,
Grunka Lunka dunkity-dasis,
The secret of Slurm's on a need-to-know basis.
",1402787,Grunka Lunka #1,"  Asking questions in school is a great way to learn.
",542788,Grunka Lunka #2,"  If you try that stuff here you might get your legs broke.
",602789,Grunka Lunka #1,"  We once found a dead guy face down in the Slurm.
",512790,Grunka Lunka #2,"  It could easily happen again to you folks.
",452791,Grunka Lunkas,"  So keep you head down,
And keep your mouth shut,
Grunka Lunka lunka dunkity dot!
",832792,Glurmo,"  Hey, I don't pay you to sing! You just used up today's bathroom break!
",732793,Grunka Lunka #2," Hard ass.
",112794,Glurmo,"  I heard that!
",162795,Glurmo," Now, on your right, you'll see the Slurm Master checking the Slurm for colour and bouquet.
",922796,Fry," So thirsty.
",132797,Glurmo," Then he tastes it. He tastes it and tastes it, then tastes it some more.
",742798,Fry," Uh, could I have some Slurm, please?
",382799,Glurmo," No food or drink allowed on the tour. You'll have to wait until you're partying with Slurms MacKenzie.
",1042800,Fry," When will that be?
",202801,Glurmo," Soon enough.
",142802,Fry," That's not soon enough.
",252803,Leela," Hey, what's behind that door?
",312804,Glurmo," Nothing.
",102805,Leela," Is it the secret ingredient?
",302806,Grunka Lunkas,"  Grunka Lunka dunkity dingredient,
You should not ask about the secret ingredient.
",842807,Bender," OK, OK, we get the point.
",272808,Leela," I was just curious because of the armed guards.
",492809,Grunka Lunkas,"  Grunka Lunka dunkity darmed guards--
",392810,Bender,"  Shut the hell up!
",202811,Hermes," So you're telling me I could fire my whole staff and hire Grunka Lunkas at half the cost?
",912812,Glurmo," That's right. They think they have a good union but they don't.  They're basically slaves.
",922813,Leela," What are you doing?
",212814,Fry," I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and dunk my head in so I can drink.
",712815,Leela," No. That's moronic.
",212816,Fry," Fine. I'll let go and swim around in the Slurm and drink as much as I want.  Help! I can't swim!
",982817,Leela," Bender, why did you jump in?
",302818,Bender," Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to be popular.
",542819,Bender," Ow!
",52820,Leela," Where are we?
",152821,Bender," And why is the Slurm pouring into this sewer?
",472822,Fry," This isn't Slurm at all!
",262823,Leela," Something's rotten on the planet Wormulon. Look at this.
",582824,Leela," This all must have something to do with the secret ingredient.
",642825,Fry," My God. What if the secret ingredient ... is people?
",542826,Leela," No. There's already a soda like that: Soylent Cola.
",532827,Fry," Oh. How is it?
",162828,Leela," It varies from person to person.
",342829,Farnsworth," Ooh!
",62830,Zoidberg," Do you have any that aren't so tight around the thorax?
",572831,Glurmo," Yes, over in-- Say, weren't there more people in your group at the start of the tour?
",872832,Amy," Hey, yeah. Fry, Leela and Bender are missing.
",472833,Glurmo," If you'll excuse me.
",222834,Leela,"  Quick.
",92835,Fry," Look! Slurm! Finally!  Oh, yeah! I'm never going 12 minutes without a Slurm again.
",842836,Leela," It's the end of the line. This must be where they put in the secret ingredient.
",812837,Fry," Well, whatever it is, it's even better fresh.  Mmm, still warm.
",652838,Fry," Ew!
",52839,Leela," Blech!
",82840,Bender," Oh, Lordy!
",122841,Leela," Fry!  Fry!
",122842,Fry," That's the secret ingredient of Slurm?
",402843,Leela," That's the only ingredient of Slurm.
",382844,Fry," Ew!
",52845,Bender," I'll save us!  Oh, that feels good!
",372846,Fry," Thanks, Bender!
",172847,Leela,"  The exit! We made it.
",242848,Bender," Uh, Your Majesty, I brought the prisoners.
",442849,Glurmo," Well, my curious friends, you learned the secret of Slurm. That concludes the portion of the tour where you stay alive.
",1212850,Leela," You wish, you slimy worm! Hi-yah!
",352851,Slurm Queen," Good work, Glurmo. You have pleased your queen.
",492852,Small Glurmo #2," Thank you, Your Majesty.
",262853,Small Glurmo #1," Thanks, ma'am.
",162854,Leela," How can you trick people into drinking something that comes out of your behind? It's disgusting.
",982855,Slurm Queen," Is it? Honey comes from a bee's behind. Milk comes from a cow's behind. And have you ever used toothpaste?
",1082856,Fry," Whose behind does that come from?
",352857,Slurm Queen," You don't wanna know.
",232858,Bender," Look, we just came to party with Slurms MacKenzie. By the way, when is that scheduled?
",882859,Slurm Queen,"  Never!  To the torture cave!
",312860,Slurm Queen," You, my metal friend, will have the honour of becoming 174 Slurm cans.
",722861,Bender," Ah, this trip is turning into a big letdown.
",462862,Slurm Queen," As for you, you will be submerged in Royal Slurm which, in a matter of minutes, will transform you into a Slurm Queen like myself.
",1322863,Small Glurmo #1," But, Your Highness, she's a commoner. Her Slurm will taste foul.
",662864,Slurm Queen," Yes! Which is why we'll market it as New Slurm. Then, when everyone hates it, we'll bring back Slurm Classic, and make billions!
",1302865,Fry," What about me?
",162866,Slurm Queen," You are free to go.
",212867,Fry," Yes!
",62868,Slurm Queen," If you can resist this concentrated super Slurm!  It's so delicious, you'll eat until you explode! Oh, which reminds me, put a tarp over that sofa, will you? Bon appÃ©tit!
",1722869,Fry," Mmm!
",62870,Slurm Queen," Farewell! Oh, and congratulations again on winning the contest.
",652871,Leela," Fry, untie us, quick!
",232872,Fry," Here I come.  Let me just-- One more taste.
",452873,Leela," You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and save us.
",472874,Bender," I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?
",452875,Leela," Yeah, we're boned.
",202876,Fry," I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. But I'm not gonna let you die.
",732877,Leela," Hurry!
",82878,Bender," What's happening?  Just in time!
",342879,Fry,"  Nooo!   I could fit if I didn't have these damn arms!
",562880,Leela," We're close to the exit. I can smell those filthy orange guys.
",642881,Slurms," Stop right there!
",192882,Bender," Slurms MacKenzie?
",192883,Slurms," Shh! I want you to take me with you.
",382884,Fry," Say what?
",112885,Slurms," I'm partied out. All I want is to stay home and rent videos and watch them with a few friends. Is that so much to ask?
",1202886,Bender," Forget it, pal.  It says on this bottle-cap you have to party with us.
",722887,Slurms," Alright, when we get to Earth. But please don't invite too many people, I wanna keep it small.
",962888,Bender," No can do, Slurms!
",202889,Slurms," This way!
",112890,Leela," She's gaining on us.
",222891,Slurms," Go on without me, I'll hold her off.
",382892,Fry," But she'll crush you like a worm ... crushing a smaller worm.
",632893,Slurms," It's alright. I'm so tired of partying. So very tired.  I'll save you the only way I know how: By partying!  Babes.
",1172894,Dixie," Yes, Mr. MacKenzie?
",212895,Slurms," You've served me well these 40 years, but this time I've got to party alone.
",782896,Trixie," But--
",72897,Slurms," There'll be other parties for you. Now go. Go!
",482898,Bender," Party on, Slurms!
",192899,Slurms," Party on, contest winners. Party on.
",382900,Slurm Queen," No! We're ruined! They know our disgusting secret!
",522901,Farnsworth," Commissioner, my crew has made a horrific discovery: It seems that Slurm is produced in a colossal worm hiney!
",1122902,Commissioner,"  Hmm, ""hiney"", you say? Why, with your testimony we'll finally be able to outlaw this insidious Slurm.
",1042903,Fry," Outlaw Slurm?  Uh, don't pay any attention to him, sir...
",592904,Fry,"  Grandpa's making up crazy stories again.
",432905,Farnsworth,"  I'm not your grandpa, you're my uncle! From the year 2000!
",612906,Commissioner,"  OK, grandpa, we'll take care of the ""bad worms"", don't you worry.
",682907,Fry," Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were here to enjoy this with me.
",672908,Bender," Yeah, that Slurms sure loved to party. Whattya say we all party one last time for him?
",882909,Leela," For Slurms!
",132910,Amy,"  For Slurms!
",142911,Bender,"  For Slurms!
",142912,Farnsworth,"  For Slurms!
",142913,Fry,"  For Slurms!
",142914,Zoidberg,"  Whammy-wazzle!
",172915,Bender," Hey, that's not that bad.
",272916,Fry," Mmm!
",62917,Announcer #1,"  Futurama is brought to you by ...  ... Glagnar's Human Rinds. It's a buncha muncha cruncha human!
",1002918,Leela," Aww! Somebody likes snouts.
",292919,Fry," Is it me?
",112920,Bender,"  Ow, my head! My precious head!   Stupid can opener. You killed my father and now you've come back for me!
",1082921,Fry," You alright, Bender?
",222922,Bender," Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why we keep this ticking time-bomb around just for that dumb animal.
",1042923,Leela," Don't yell at Nibbler like that.  You hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him and make up.
",882924,Bender,"  No.
",62925,Leela," I said pet him.
",172926,Bender," I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both hands!  Ow! My ass! Get off!
",672927,Leela," Are you alright?
",182928,Bender," Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure.
",402929,Leela," Not you.  Aww, poor baby chipped a fang.
",422930,Bender," Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't see anyone kissing it.
",622931,Zoidberg,"  Alright, I'm coming.
",232932,Jeffery," Remember, Rover gets the pill and Pepper gets the suppository.  Next.
",712933,Jeffery," It's just a simple broken fang, nothing serious.
",502934,Bender," What's that you say there, doctor? You're gonna have to put him down?
",712935,Jeffery," No-- What? Huh?
",172936,Bender," Terrible shame that. Shall I do the honours?
",462937,Leela," No!
",52938,Bender," You about done?
",172939,Leela," Next time I'm keeping it.
",272940,Jeffery," OK, well I believe I have a replacement fang for your pet in the next room.  The jaguar didn't wanna cooperate but luckily he knocked one of my teeth out.  Now then.
",1672941,Fry," Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?
",462942,Jeffery," Um, I'm still a little woozy from a gazelle kick this morning but if he's anything like the common tree, the rings might indicate his age.
",1402943,Fry," Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings.
",802944,Jeffery," He's five.
",122945,Farnsworth," Happy birthday, young Nibbler.
",322946,Leela," Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!
",482947,Bender,"  I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape.
",512948,Fry," Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?
",482949,Bender," Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am.  And the crowd goes wild! What prize do I get? Cash?
",932950,Amy," Hey, look at Nibbler!
",232951,Hermes," Aww, he's holding a spoon.
",282952,Zoidberg," He's so talented!
",192953,Bender," You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime.  Ta-da!
",972954,Hermes," Now he's wearing a hat!
",252955,Leela," Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!
",412956,All,"  What day is today?
It's Nibbler's birthday,
What a day for a birthday,
Let's all have some cake.
",992957,Fry,"  And you smell like one too!
",302958,Bender," Hey, what about this?
",232959,Leela," Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party.
",672960,Bender," Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler.
",352961,Leela," Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it.
",1242962,Bender," So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget.
",752963,Bender," That'll take care of those annoying rats.  Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me.
",1282964,Bender," There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public.  No! Get away from there!  That's it.
",1752965,Bender," Happy birthday!
",172966,Leela," Bender, what's going--   No!
",302967,Bender," Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?
",422968,Amy," Bender! How could you flush Nibbler down the toilet?
",542969,Bender," Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?
",952970,Leela,"  Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?
",802971,Bender," Only one way to find out.
",272972,Leela,"  You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.
",512973,Bender," Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.
",492974,Leela," You do?
",92975,Bender," Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants, lady.
",952976,Farnsworth," And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I too hope one day to go: The toilet.
",1182977,Leela,"  I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he caused me.
",742978,Calculon,"  Give it to me straight, doctor, don't sugarcoat it.
",542979,Doctorbot,"  Very well. Your entire family died when a plane piloted by your fiancÃ©e crashed into your uninsured home. And you have inoperable cancer.
",1402980,Bender," Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!
",472981,Amy," It's like he doesn't understand simple humanoid emotion.
",582982,Leela," I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel.
",572983,Farnsworth," Actually, through the miracle of science, that can be arranged.
",652984,Fry," Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line Man was not meant to cross?
",982985,Linda,"  The official death toll in that tragic rocket crash has now been raised to 54,000.
",852986,Bender," Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?
",482987,Farnsworth," I need to tinker in it.
",252988,Bender," Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
",492989,Farnsworth," Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy chip.
",452990,Fry," And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?
",592991,Farnsworth," Yes. If by ""allow"" you mean ""force"".
",382992,Bender," Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow...
",462993,Farnsworth,"  Oh, dear. Oh, my. I got it. Once more.
",412994,Bender," Ow! Professor!
",162995,Farnsworth,"  Steady now.
",142996,Bender," Ow!
",52997,Farnsworth," There we go.  Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency.
",712998,Bender," My God! I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads.
",1272999,Zoidberg," That's me, baby!
",183000,Farnsworth," Hmm.
",63001,Bender," Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her.
",1113002,Amy," Uh ... that's me.
",193003,Fry,"  Thanks for covering.
",233004,Bender," This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.
",643005,Amy," Bingo!
",83006,Hermes," That's Leela!
",153007,Leela," Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain.
",713008,Bender," Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self.
",733009,Leela," I'm not mopey. You shut up!
",293010,Bender," Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet!
",813011,Leela," Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel slightly less miserable already.
",723012,Amy," Hey, you know what'd cheer you up? You should get a puppy.
",603013,Leela," A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.
",403014,Fry," What's your problem?
",223015,Bender,"  I miss Nibbler.
",183016,Fry," You do?
",93017,Bender," Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings.  Why can't she just drink herself happy like a normal person?
",1033018,Bender," Uh-oh, jealousy.   You think you're so hot!
",453019,Fry," What?
",73020,Bender," The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
",733021,Fry,"  They're just responding to my personality.
",453022,Amy," Um, Leela? Armando and I are going to the back seat of his car for coffee. You gonna be alright here by yourself?
",1153023,Leela,"  Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You two go enjoy yourselves.
",723024,Bender,"  I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream.   A bucket of--
",733025,Fry,"  The spoon's in the foot powder.
",343026,Bender," I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler.
",853027,Fry," Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things, they stay alive in the sewers.
",1013028,Bender," Really?
",93029,Fry," Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact.
",813030,Bender," Hmm, sewers.  Thinking, thinking, thinking.
",453031,Bender," Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you.  Damn, it's too small.  What did those human design this for anyway?  Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero!  See you on the other side!
",1843032,Fry," Bender? Bender?
",173033,Fry," Have you seen my sombrero?
",283034,Leela," Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?
",703035,Fry," Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel bad.
",883036,Leela," You're right. I feel terrible.
",323037,Fry," Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!
",463038,Leela," I guess we'd better go down into the sewers and look for him.
",633039,Amy," Are you crazy? There's mutants down there! They'll eat you alive.
",673040,Zoidberg," They're hideous!
",183041,Leela," There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.
",673042,Farnsworth," Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate down there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive run-off and good old American faeces!
",1753043,Fry," God bless America.
",203044,Fry," Phew! Uh, ladies first.
",253045,Fry," Oh, and the aftertaste!
",253046,Leela," What is it?
",133047,Fry," I burned my finger.
",213048,Leela," OK, check the guidebook.
",263049,Fry," Looks like we're under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think: All this was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met.
",1203050,Leela," Wait, what's that?
",203051,Bender," I never should have thrown out the manual.
",443052,Leela," Bender, you didn't have to come down here.
",443053,Bender," I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much.
",443054,Leela,"  He was so cute.
",183055,Bender,"  He was so sweet.
",193056,Fry," Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous.  Or maybe it's whatever that is.
",853057,Leela,"  Nibbler?
",113058,Bender,"  Nibbler?
",113059,Leela," It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?
",533060,Fry," Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe.  Don't worry. It gets wider after about a mile.
",1203061,Leela,"  Idiot.
",93062,Bender,"  Idiot.
",93063,Fry," OK, OK, never mind. I'll just ask those people for directions.
",643064,Leela,"  Mutants!
",113065,Leela," Mutants! They're real!
",243066,Fry," I'll take care of this!  Back! Back!
",383067,Vyolet," Thanks, handsome.
",193068,Dwayne," Please, do not be frightened, we're harmless.
",473069,Raoul," I have three arms.
",203070,Dwayne," I said ""harmless"" not ""armless"".
",343071,Vyolet," Lay off him. You know he's only got one ear.
",463072,Fry," Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants.
",673073,Dwayne," Mutants? Perhaps it is you who are the mutants.
",493074,Vyolet," Please, Dwayne, have you looked in a mirror lately?
",533075,Raoul," Welcome to our village. It may not be Paris but it has a certain quaint charm that I, for one, wouldn't trade for the world.
",1263076,Bender," You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?
",463077,Dwayne," Perhaps. But perhaps your civilisation is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you.
",983078,Leela," No, we're on the top.
",233079,Fry," Daylight and everything.
",263080,Vyolet," It must be wonderful.
",233081,Bender," Eh.
",53082,Leela," Listen. We actually came down here to find our pet, Nibbler. He got flushed down the toilet.
",943083,Raoul," Well if he got flushed down the toilet he probably came through here. Everything always does. Follow me.  All that is ours was once flushed down your toilets. Over there is our aquarium.  This is our library.
",2103084,Bender," Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
",423085,Raoul," And over here is our church.
",303086,Fry," Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?
",513087,Vyolet," Yeah, but nobody's that observant. It's mainly a Christmas and Easter thing.
",783088,Leela,"  Nibbler?
",113089,Bender,"  Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums.
",333090,Fry," So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down here?
",753091,Vyolet," No. That's just an urban legend.
",343092,Bender,"  Then what are those?
",233093,Vyolet," Crocodiles.
",133094,Raoul," We keep them as pets. Then, when they grow too large, we flush them down into the sub-sewer.
",943095,Dwayne," Some say there's a freakish race of sub-mutants down there.
",613096,Vyolet," Please, that's just a sub-urban legend.
",413097,Dwayne," Oh? Then I suppose you also don't believe in ...  ... El Chupanibre.
",703098,Leela," El Chupanibre? What's that?
",293099,Dwayne," Gather round, children, for the legend of El Chupanibre.
 He creeps and crawls in the midnight hush,
Silent as a low-flow toilet flush,
Watch your step,
'Cause sooner or later,
He'll eat you whole,
And half your alligator.
",2243100,Vyolet," Crocodile.
",123101,Dwayne," Whatever.
",113102,Leela," Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat. He must be El Chupanibre.
",983103,Bender," Hey, yeah!
",123104,Raoul," You unleashed the dreaded El Chupanibre upon us? Then you are our sworn enemies.
",823105,Leela," You don't understand. He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture him.
",803106,Dwayne," Impossible. If the legend is true, our only hope is to offer him a snack-rifice.
",823107,Raoul," Yes. An unspoiled virgin.
",273108,Leela,"  I volunteer.
",153109,Vyolet," Nice try, Leela, but we've all seen Zapp Brannigan's webpage.
",633110,Bender," Oh, I made myself feel bad.
",293111,Raoul," She'll have to do. Chain her to the post!  And rip her shirt a little.  Behold. When El Chupanibre comes for the, uh, ""virgin"", he will be snared by this rope trap.
",1663112,Dwayne,"  Shh. El Chupanibre comes soon. It is nightfall.
",503113,Leela," Nightfall? How can you tell down here?
",403114,Dwayne," The tide is coming in.
",243115,Vyolet," Quiet! The beast approaches.
",303116,Bender," Nibbler! Aw, come here, precious!  Look, everyone, it's El Chupanibre.
",723117,Dwayne," That's not El Chupanibre.
",273118,Bender," Say what?
",113119,Dwayne," That's El Chupanibre.
",233120,Fry," I'll take care of this.
",253121,Leela," Bender, do something.
",233122,Bender," I'm too scared.
",173123,Fry," Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!
",1153124,Leela," I can't. I love every living creature.
",403125,Fry," Even me?
",103126,Leela," As a friend.
",143127,Fry," Damn.
",73128,Bender," Listen to me, Leela: I'm an expert at not caring. The secret is to stop giving a rat's ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things that you want, that you deserve, that the world owes you.
",2013129,Leela," Well, I could use a new tank top.
",353130,Bender," Bigger! Bigger!
",173131,Leela," A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels.
",713132,Bender," Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit.
",643133,Leela," Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
",793134,Bender," Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler.
",413135,Fry," Bender's gonna be killed!
",273136,Leela," You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.
",883137,Fry,"  Yeah!
",83138,Leela," You did it!
",133139,Raoul," Let's have a tissue-tape parade!
",343140,Bender," No, thanks!
",133141,Dwayne," Gather round, children, to hear the legend of Bender.
 He came from above with a--
 It's gonna be many a year before someone flushes another guitar string.
",1573142,Farnsworth," That was a disgusting story.
",303143,Leela," And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender.
",523144,Bender," I love you too.  Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!
",713145,Farnsworth," Bender, you won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The emotion you felt for Nibbler was actually your own.
",1223146,Fry," Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other people's feelings afterall.
",983147,Farnsworth," No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was running at triple capacity.
",653148,Bender," And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!
",543149,Leela," You know, Bender may not have learned anything from me, but I think I actually learned something from him.   So long, jerkwads!
",1293150,Farnsworth,"  So long!
",113151,Fry," Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six.  Check.
",403152,Bender," Hmm. Get him, boys!
",213153,Fry,"  Good move.
",133154,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone.  We have a mission to further the noble cause of intergalactic peace.
",923155,Bender," Nope. Watching cartoons.
",263156,Fry," Sorry.
",83157,Leela," What's the mission?
",213158,Farnsworth," It's a delivery for the Democratic Order Of Planets.
",543159,Fry," DOOP? What's that?
",203160,Farnsworth," It's similar to the United Nations from your time, Fry.
",573161,Fry," Uh...
",73162,Hermes," Or like the Federation from your Star Trek programme.
",553163,Fry,"  Oh!
",63164,Farnsworth," Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the DOOP's new headquarters.
",643165,Leela," What are we delivering?
",253166,Farnsworth," Something without which no ribbon-cutting ceremony could proceed. The ceremonial oversized scissors.
",1023167,Leela," We'll get them there as quickly as we can.
",443168,Farnsworth," Alright, but don't run with them.
",353169,Fry," Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind-blowing. Ooh, a reception table with muffins!
",1113170,Glab," Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the DOOP's magnificent new headquarters. A fitting home for an organisation that has fostered peace throughout the universe. Even between the Insectoids and the Space Lizards.
",2413171,Fry," So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?
",403172,Amazonian," Big rats there. Me crush with club.
",373173,Fry," That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a coffee.
",773174,Glab," I can think of no better place for this centre of diplomacy than here in orbit around the Neutral Planet.  What are your thoughts on this momentous occasion, Your Neutralness?
",1773175,Neutral President," I have no strong feelings one way or the other.
",493176,Zapp," I hate these filthy Neutrals, Kif. With enemies you know where they stand but with Neutrals, who knows? It sickens me.  Halt.  Why, Leela, I do believe we've met.
",1643177,Bender,"  He means you guys did it.
",283178,Leela," If you don't mind, we're here to deliver the scissors for the ribbon-cutting.
",793179,Zapp," Then you're under arrest.
",273180,Leela," What for?
",113181,Zapp," How do I know these scissors aren't part of some Neutral plot?
",643182,Leela," But they're not even sharp. Who could I possibly hurt with them?
",663183,Zapp," The Yarn People of Nylar 4?  So, a plan to assassinate a weird-looking alien with scissors. How very Neutral of you.
",1183184,Leela," What?
",73185,Zapp," It was almost the perfect crime, but you forgot one thing: Rock crushes scissors ... but paper covers rock ... and scissors cut paper. Kif, we have a conundrum.  Search them for paper, and bring me a rock.
",2073186,Kif," Why?
",63187,Zapp," So beautiful, yet so neutral.  Drag them to the ship.
",553188,Glab," And now, to cut the ribbon, the legendary DOOP captain who just returned from a triumphant carpet-bombing of Eden 7, Zapp Brannigan.
",1343189,Zapp," What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?
",1093190,Kif," Um, sir, you're supposed to be cutting the ribbon right now.
",623191,Zapp," No matter. I'll simply cut it from here with the ship's laser.
",643192,Kif," Sir, I don't think that's wise.
",333193,Zapp," Kif, if there's one thing I don't need it's your I-don't-think-that's-wise attitude.
",863194,Zapp," Whoopsie-daisy!
",173195,Glab," Zapp Brannigan, you stand accused of blowing up DOOP headquarters. How do you plead?
",863196,Zapp," Absolutely 99% not guilty.
",283197,Glab," Then the prosecutor will call his first witness.
",503198,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, I'm just a simple Hyper-Chicken from a backwoods asteroid but if it please the court I reckon I'll call the entire jury.
",1353199,Glab," I'm going to allow this.
",263200,Hyper-Chicken," Members of the jury ...  ... did y'all happen to catch a gander at who blew up that there DOOP headquarters?
",1103201,Juror #1,"  That's the guy, right there.
",313202,Juror #2,"  Oh, yeah, right there.
",253203,Small Glurmo #1,"  That one.
",123204,Hyper-Chicken," And are y'all gonna vote to convict him?
",423205,Neptunian,"  You'd better believe it.
",273206,Juror #1,"  You bet.
",113207,Glab," The jury is instructed to disregard its own testimony.
",563208,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, the prosecution rests.
",373209,Glab," The evidence against Zapp Brannigan is strong. However, in light of his years of service, and the incompetence of this hillbilly prosecutor, I'm afraid I must dismiss all charges.
",1813210,Leela," Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I know the case is closed and you've rendered your verdict, but I wanna testify.
",1163211,Glab," I'm going to allow this.
",263212,Hyper-Chicken," Now, Miss Leela, on the date in question, were you or were you not wearing a hoop skirt?
",903213,Leela," That's a stupid question. What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye.
",1613214,Zapp," I'd like to cross-examine the witness.
",403215,Glab," I'm going to allow this.
",263216,Zapp," We've met before have we not?
",313217,Leela,"  Yes.
",73218,Zapp," And on that occasion, did you have sex with someone? May I remind you you are still under oath.
",973219,Leela,"  Yes.
",73220,Zapp," Please point out the person in this courtroom you had sex with.  And his name is?
",833221,Leela," Zapp Brannigan.
",173222,Zapp," The very same Zapp Brannigan who did not blow up DOOP headquarters. I rest my case.
",853223,Glab," Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may begin your deliberations.
",693224,Small Glurmo #1," Your Honour, we have reached a verdict. We find the defendant ... guilty.
",753225,Glab," Zapp Brannigan, you are hereby stripped of your rank as captain and dismissed from the DOOP.
",943226,Zapp," I'd like to make one final statement. Kif, c'mere and hold up the flag.  And wave it a little, for God's sakes. My friends, you can take away a man's title and his uniform but you can never take away his integrity or his honour. Plus it was mostly Kif's fault.
",2623227,Kif," What?
",73228,Glab," Kif Kroker, you are also stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged.
",783229,Zapp," One day a man has everything, the next day he blows up a $400 billion space station and the next day he has nothing. It makes you think.
",1383230,Kif," No, it doesn't.
",173231,Zapp," Come, Kif, it's time to begin our life as civilians.  That's an order, soldier.
",813232,Fry," Hey, Bender?
",143233,Bender," Yeah?
",73234,Leela," Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second one using actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship like I ordered you to.
",1763235,Fry," You don't have to get so mad, Leela.
",383236,Bender," Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger.
",633237,Leela," Zapp?
",73238,Zapp," Leela, I didn't know where else to turn. You're the only woman who ever loved me.
",833239,Leela," I never loved you.
",203240,Zapp," I mean physically.
",203241,Leela," What do you want?
",193242,Zapp," Just let me work for a little food. Perhaps I could paint a fence, or service you sexually, or mop the floors.
",1123243,Leela," You don't know how to do any of those things.
",473244,Zapp," Kif might.
",123245,Farnsworth," Leela, who are you talking to?
",323246,Zapp," Just a broken-down hobo who's hit rock-bottom. And his commanding officer.
",763247,Farnsworth," Why, you're that disgraced starship captain.  Having him on staff will distract people from our horrendous safety record.  Come in.
",1333248,Farnsworth," I'd like everyone to meet our new employees.   Which ones are new?
",683249,Hermes," The green dude and the fat man.
",333250,Farnsworth," Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either.
",623251,Bender," I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.
",433252,Farnsworth," Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course.  Anyway, whoever you all are, I have good news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high gravity you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy!
",2363253,Zapp," So, this Leela. I know she's a very sensuous woman but what manner of captain is she?
",873254,Fry," She's really strict.
",223255,Bender," And mean.
",113256,Zapp," I see. Does she by any chance give the crewmembers spankings?
",633257,Fry," No, she just makes us do work and stuff.
",423258,Zapp," Good, good. But should she ever institute some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy, let me go in your place. I won't have my comrades harmed.
",1433259,Bender," Hey, this guy's alright!
",263260,Zapp," Here's to us poor schmoes working for the man. Even if he is a hot, sexy, female man.
",873261,Kif," I've computed out landing co-ordinates, Captain.
",503262,Leela," Thanks, Kif. Very nice work.
",303263,Kif," Wait, what?
",133264,Leela," I said ""very nice work"".
",263265,Kif," This is the happiest day of my life.
",383266,Leela," OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel.
",783267,Bender," They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.
",633268,Leela," They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense.
",1323269,Fry," Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me.
",473270,Leela," I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time.
",883271,Bender," Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once.
",613272,Fry," Yeah!
",73273,Zapp," That's using the old noodle!
",303274,Zapp," Come on, girdle. Hold!
",243275,Bender," Uh-oh.
",83276,Leela," What the hell happened?
",253277,Bender," Some breaking occurred, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know.
",753278,Leela," I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here.
",843279,Fry," Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly.
",783280,Bender," I'll start loading up the pillows.
",363281,Leela," No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows by hand.
",903282,Zapp," Let me ask you a serious question, Leela: Does the company that made your bra make a girdle as well? I ask because a friend of mine...
",1363283,Leela," Just get to work.
",193284,Bender,"  I'm Leela, get to work, neh, neh, neh.
",413285,Fry," I agree.
",103286,Kif," The point is, it's just so humiliating working for that man. Once, he actually ordered me to ... shave his armpits while he was in the bathtub. So, I said--
",1583287,Leela," Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?
",693288,Kif," Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout then, um... OK, well, there he was in the tub, alright?
",963289,Fry," Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off.
",593290,Bender," This is all Leela's fault.
",283291,Fry," Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now.
",1043292,Zapp," Y'know, boys, a good captain needs many skills, such as boldness, daring and a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced Leela has any of those things.
",1493293,Fry," Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much.
",723294,Zapp," Back when I was captain all I asked from my men was their complete loyalty. If I had that, then for all I cared they could sit around the whole day drinking beer in their underpants.
",1843295,Bender," Beer?
",73296,Fry," Underpants?
",133297,Kif," But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. I'm free!  Oh, you hear that? I'm actually laughing!
",913298,Fry," This is a mutiny.
",193299,Bender," You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain.
",503300,Fry," All hail the new captain.
",273301,Zapp," Leela, you might be a formidable do-er of the nasty but I am forced to relieve you of your post.
",983302,Leela," On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?
",383303,Zapp," Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her in the brig.
",533304,Fry," We don't have a brig.
",233305,Zapp," Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as ""the brig"".
",883306,Leela," You really don't want me to be captain anymore?
",493307,Bender," You got it, genius.
",213308,Leela," But, didn't I do a good job?
",303309,Fry," You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.
",643310,Leela," Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends.
",853311,Fry," Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then.
",633312,Bender," Don't worry, Leela. Soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh.
",723313,Zapp," Back in my old uniform, and it nearly still fits. Even after all that fattening hobo cuisine.
",953314,Kif," What shall I do with your civilian clothes, sir?
",503315,Zapp," Take them to the laundry-brig.  So, do I have your loyalty, men?
",663316,Bender,"  To the ends of the universe.
",313317,Fry," Ten hundred percent!
",223318,Zapp," That's not nearly loyal enough. I order you to sit around and drink beer until you're as loyal as Kif here.
",1093319,Bender," Yes, sir, sir!
",163320,Kif," Um, may I have a beer, sir?
",293321,Zapp," No. You're loyal enough already. Meanwhile, I have a plan. We will single-handedly attack our archenemy the Neutral Planet.
",1253322,Kif," Oh, jeez.
",113323,Zapp," Once the neutral war machine lies in ruins, I'll be a hero again and the DOOP will reinstate me as captain.
",1093324,Kif," But, sir, that plan makes no sense.
",373325,Zapp," Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall correctly, you were court-martialled in disgrace.
",903326,Fry," Ooh, burn!
",123327,Bender," Nailed you, buddy!
",203328,Zapp," Prepare to continue the epic struggle between good and neutral.
",653329,Fry," This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ...  ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like...
",1483330,Zapp," Precisely. Now, in the name of all that is good and honourable, we'll call the Neutral President with a message of peace, then blast him.
",1393331,Bender,"  Yes, sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!
",313332,Zapp," Fly the white flag of war.
",283333,Zapp,"  This is Zapp Brannigan of the good ship ... Planet Express Ship. I come swinging the olive branch of peace.
",1103334,Neutral Presidents Aide," Should we trust him, Your Neutralness?
",403335,Neutral President," All I know is my gut says maybe.
",343336,Bender," What now, chief?
",183337,Zapp," Now we crash the ship into their headquarters, killing them in a hellish firestorm from which no living thing can escape.
",1233338,Fry," Good, good, then what?
",243339,Zapp," Then your mission is complete. I, meanwhile, will have ejected to safety, wearing the only spacesuit on board.
",1123340,Fry," Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?
",443341,Zapp," Of course. What do you think I meant by ""loyalty""? Now help me into the only spacesuit. It looks a bit sweaty in there so you may need to apply baby powder.
",1583342,Fry," Leela, we want you to be captain again.
",413343,Leela," Let me guess. He cancelled naptime?  He ran out of beer?  So he's about to kill us?
",853344,Fry," We want Leela to be captain again.
",363345,Zapp," So it's mutiny, is it? I never thought I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's eject. I found a children's spacesuit you can wear.
",1263346,Kif," To be honest, sir, I'd rather stay here with Captain Leela. She actually listens to what I have to--
",1023347,Leela," Oh, no! He's disabled the steering.  We're gonna crash!
",573348,Bender," Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo.  And Fry.
",693349,Leela," OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?
",743350,Fry," Absolutely.
",133351,Leela," Even if I make you work hard?
",313352,Bender," As your God is my witness.
",283353,Leela," Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine.
",973354,Bender," Oh, man, that crap's heavy.
",293355,Fry," And warm.
",113356,Leela," Just do it.
",133357,Neutral Presidents Aide," Your Neutralness, it's a beige alert.
",393358,Neutral President," If I don't survive, tell my wife, ""Hello"".
",443359,Leela," Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.
",443360,Bender,"  Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it.
",633361,Fry," It's too low.
",153362,Bender," Quick.
",83363,Leela," You did it! You actually did it!
",343364,Fry," And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.
",553365,Zapp," And so, when Captain Leela panicked, perhaps distracted by female troubles, my quick thinking allowed me to do whatever I did to save the day.
",1443366,Glab," Captain Leela, is this rambling story of magic and heroism true?
",663367,Leela," Well, actually--
",183368,Farnsworth,"  That a girl! If they don't take him back we can keep him as captain.
",713369,Leela," Your Honour, it's all true: My female incompetence, Zapp's cat-like reflexes, the stuff that made no sense, all of it.
",1203370,Glab," In that case, Zapp Brannigan, I hereby restore your rank and parking privileges.
",823371,Farnsworth," Oh, foo!
",103372,Zapp," Come, Kif, we've got work to do.
",343373,Kif," I-I'll call and tell you about it.
",363374,Fry," Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever.
",923375,Bender," Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?
",573376,Leela," No.
",53377,Fry," Please?
",93378,Bender," Come on, Captain.
",193379,Leela," Oh, alright.
",143380,Farnsworth," No time off.
",143381,Fry," Aw, man.
",103382,Leela," Let's mutiny!
",153383,Narrator,"  You're entering the vicinity of an area adjacent to a location.  The kind of place where there might be a monster or some kind of weird mirror.  These are just examples. It could also be something much better.  Prepare to enter The Scary Door.  As per your request, please find enclosed the last man on earth.
",3123384,Man #1,"  Finally, solitude. I can read books for all eternity.  It's not fair! It's not fair! Wait, my eyes aren't that bad. I can still read the large print books.  It's not f-- Well, lucky I know how to read Braille!  Hey, look at that weird mirror!
",2453385,Bender," Cursed by his own hubris!
",273386,Leela," There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!
",593387,Bender," Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate!
",573388,Announcer #1,"  C-SPAN9 presents: The Thrill Of Politics.
",443389,Leela," Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these two men will become president of the world.
",1183390,Fry," What do we care? We live in the United States.
",483391,Leela," The United States is part of the world.
",413392,Fry," Wow! I have been gone a long time.
",363393,Johnson,"  It's time someone had the courage to stand up and say: ""I'm against those things that everybody hates"".
",1063394,Jackson,"  Now I respect my opponent. I think he's a good man but, quite frankly, I agree with everything he just said!
",1113395,Fry," These are the candidates? They sound like clones.  Wait a minute. They are clones!
",843396,Leela," Don't let their identical DNA fool you. They differ on some key issues.
",733397,Johnson,"  I say your three cent titanium tax goes too far.
",513398,Jackson,"  And I say your three cent titanium tax doesn't go too far enough!
",683399,Fry," If I were registered to vote, I'd send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown.
",1253400,Leela," You're not registered?
",243401,Fry," Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides, it's not like one vote ever made a difference.
",863402,Leela," That's not true; the first robot president won by exactly one vote.
",693403,Bender," Ah, yes, John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.
",1173404,Farnsworth," But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.
",693405,Leela," The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't, I'm still taking you to get registered.
",1123406,Farnsworth," Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all go register!
",523407,Fry," Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?
",573408,Farnsworth," The very instant I became old.
",323409,Farnsworth," The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate.
",1043410,Fry," The less fortunate get all the breaks!
",403411,Zoidberg," You know, Fry, you could join a third party, maybe.
",533412,Amy," Only weirdos and mutants join third parties.
",463413,Zoidberg," Really? I'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting.
",573414,Fry," What party do you belong to, Bender?
",383415,Bender," I'm not allowed to vote.
",263416,Fry," 'Cause you're a robot?
",243417,Bender," No, convicted felon.
",223418,Woman #1," We favour unreasonably huge subsidies to the Brain Slug Planet.
",653419,Fry," OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?
",803420,Woman #1," Attach Brain Slugs to them.
",293421,Fry,"  Sure, you say that now!
",263422,Amy," So, is it true you can make all kinds of shirts and ropes out of hemp?
",723423,Stoned Guy," Dave's not here, man.
",233424,Amy," I also heard hemp makes great shampoo.
",403425,Stoned Guy," It does? No way! I gotta check out this brochure!
",513426,Farnsworth," So what are you doing to protect my constitutional right to bear doomsday devices?
",843427,N.R.A. Man #1," Well, first off, we're gonna get rid of that three-day waiting period for mad scientists.
",913428,Farnsworth," Damn straight! Today, the mad scientist can't get a doomsday device, tomorrow it's the mad grad student. Where will it end?
",1253429,N.R.A. Man #1," Amen, brother. I don't go anywhere without my mutated anthrax ...  ... for duck hunting.
",903430,Zoidberg," Sure, humans are cute, but how else are we supposed to test cosmetics?
",723431,Hermes," I concur.
",113432,Fry," Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!
",573433,V.A.P. Man #1," Sorry, not with that attitude.
",323434,Fry,"  OK then, screw it.
",213435,V.A.P. Man #1," Welcome aboard, brother!
",263436,Fry,"  Alright!
",113437,V.A.P. Man #1," You're out.
",133438,Fry," That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested in politics.
",843439,Linda,"  And so, with two weeks left in the campaign, the question on everyone's mind is who will be the next President of Earth? Jack Johnson or bitter rival John Jackson? Two terrific candidates, huh, Morbo?
",2033440,Morbo,"  All humans are vermin in the eyes of Morbo.
",463441,Linda,"  In other local news, disaster struck on Saturn's moon of Titan today, when a titanium mine collapsed, trapping 1,000 robot workers.
",1343442,Bender," What? Lord have mercy!
",243443,Linda,"  Unless something is done quickly, the trapped robots will be dead within 300 years.  Sir, what rescue operations are planned?
",1283444,Mine Spokesman,"  The plan is basically to pave over the area and get on with our lives.
",733445,Morbo,"  News of the mines closing sent titanium prices skyrocketing.
",633446,Bender," Alright! I'm rich!
",203447,Leela," What are you talking about?
",293448,Bender," My body's 40% titanium!  I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines.
",773449,Fry," Too bad you can't spend it.
",293450,Bender,"  Oh, can't I?
",153451,Fry," No.
",53452,Bender," Watch me, poor man.
",213453,Pawnbroker,"  Pleasure doing business with you.
",363454,Bender," Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves!  Hey, get away. Shoo! I'll give you five dollars to not do what you're thinking about doing.  You just lost five dollars!
",2193455,Bender," Hey, buddy. Little help?   Thank you!
",393456,Bender," Hello, peasants.
",183457,Leela," Bender? What happened to you?
",313458,Fry," Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?
",503459,Bender," No, I sold my body.
",213460,Farnsworth," Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewellery and skintight pants.
",1863461,Fry," This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?
",633462,Bender," Pft! Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it.
",1043463,Fry," Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark.
",533464,Bender," Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?
",493465,Bender," Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please.
",483466,Bender," Shaken, not stirred.  Aw, yeah!
",333467,Bender," Put it all on black.
",223468,Croupier," 21 red.  I beg your pardon. 33 black.
",393469,Bender," Yes! The rich get richer!
",273470,Bender," Strike! In your face, Leela!  Ow!
",353471,Bender,"  Timber!
",103472,Fry," Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?
",453473,Bender," Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!
",1143474,Fry," Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.
",453475,Bender," I've had it up to here with this place. I'm off to the Head Museum to hang out with classy heads like me who appreciate the finer things: poetry, philosophy, hats. So long, coffin stuffers!  Uh, could one of you coffin stuffers please carry me?
",2463476,Bender," Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think, Fry? Fry?
",963477,Schiffer," Hi, I'm Claudia Schiffer's head.
",343478,Fry," I recognise you. Didn't you use to have a body of some sort?
",623479,Schiffer," Yeah, but it was holding me back. You know, I just did the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimcap Issue.
",1073480,Fry," Well, you're looking great.
",293481,Schiffer," Thanks. I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds though.
",533482,Fry,"  Couldn't hurt.
",173483,Bender," Ah, US presidents.  Sturdy shelves, good security.  This place has class.
",753484,Clinton,"  Hey, sugar cookie. You know, legally, nothing I can do counts as sex anymore.
",803485,Ford," I apologise for his rudeness, ma'am. He gets this way around meaty-looking women.
",833486,Fry,"  Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time. But voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine.
",1333487,Ford," Frankly, I've never felt voting to be all that essential to the process.
",743488,Nixon," No kidding, Ford.
",193489,Bender," So then the hookerbot says, ""That's not my expansion slot"" and my friend says, ""That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!""
",1263490,Washington," Oh, Bender. Thou robots really cracketh me up.
",483491,Bender," You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?
",653492,George H.W. Bush," Sorry, Bender, but we just can't allow every Tom, Dick, and Harry to move in. No offence, Jefferson, Nixon and Truman.
",1203493,Carter," Maybe Mr. Bender can get a spot in the closet of presidential losers.
",713494,Dole," Bob Dole needs company. LaRouche won't stop with the ""knock knock"" jokes.
",753495,Bender," Pass.
",73496,Washington," So, telleth, Bender. What hath happened to your body?
",553497,Bender," I hocked it.
",143498,Washington," Hocked it? Why wouldst thou do that?
",383499,Bender," Same reason you hocked your teeth.
",363500,Washington," Ah. Booze money.
",183501,Nixon," I remember my body; flabby, pastey-skinned, riddled with phlebitis. A good Republican body! God, I loved it.
",1103502,Fry," I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it was tough love but-- Ooh!
",973503,Leela," Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong.
",873504,Bender," So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?
",733505,Nixon," No, son. It's a sad and lonely life.
",383506,Bender," Oh, great. Now you tell me!
",293507,Nixon," That's my style. I like to kick 'em when they're down!
",563508,Bender,"  Ones ... zeros ... one, one, zero, zero, one--
",493509,Fry," Bender, what is it?
",213510,Bender," Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two.
",823511,Fry," It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two.
",603512,Bender," I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned it's back on it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!
",1573513,Bender," You sold my body? To who?
",273514,Pawnbroker," I can't reveal that information, but you look like a nice robot. Tell you what, I'll give you 50 bucks for the kid.
",1173515,Fry," Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!
",373516,Pawnbroker," Deal.
",73517,Bender,"  Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest of my life like this.
",853518,Farnsworth," Don't you have a self-destruct button?
",403519,Bender,"  Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?
",493520,Fry," Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!
",553521,Nixon,"  And so, ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing my head into the ring. I'm announcing my candidacy for the presidency of Earth.
",1253522,Journalist #1," Just one question.
",203523,Scoop Chang," Scoop Chang, Beijing Bugle. Sir, the constitution clearly states that nobody can be elected president more than twice.
",1203524,Nixon," That's right. Nobody.  But as you can plainly see, I've got a shiny new body!
",793525,Bender," Oh!
",53526,Leela," Bender, he's got your body!
",293527,Bender," That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!
",783528,Leela," Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop.
",543529,Fry," Yeah, and that electric guitar.
",333530,Nixon,"  Remember what the dormouse said,
Feed your head.
 I'm meeting you half way, you stupid hippies!  I am not a crook's head!
",1243531,Bender," Yeah, you are, you stole my body! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me!
",663532,Leela," Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you on how this is your own fault for being such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is on the loose, we have a duty to take action. Idiot.
",1743533,Morbo," Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates: Puny Human #1, Puny Human #2, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.
",1183534,Nixon," Hello, Morbo. How's the family?
",333535,Morbo," Belligerent and numerous.
",273536,Nixon," Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
",433537,Bender," Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff.
",613538,Leela," Come on. We've gotta find some way to talk to him.
",523539,Morbo," Morbo demands an answer to the following question: If you saw delicious candy in the hands of a small child would you seize and consume it?
",1413540,Johnson," Unthinkable.
",143541,Jackson," I wouldn't think of it.
",253542,Morbo," What about you, Mr. Nixon? I remind you, you are under a truth-o-scope.
",733543,Nixon," Uh, well, I, uh ... the question is-is vague. You don't say what kind of candy, whether anyone is watching or, uh...  At any rate, I certainly wouldn't harm the child.
",1693544,Nixons campaign manager," You scored big points tonight, sir.
",373545,Nixon," What are you talking about? They ate me alive out there.
",583546,Nixons campaign manager," Yes, but your body stayed on message. And that message is, ""Look at my shiny new body"". The robots ate it up. You've got real charisma from the neck down.
",1563547,Nixon," Nixon with charisma? My God, I can rule the universe!
",553548,Bender," Give me my body back, you two-bit thief!
",423549,Nixon," Now, look here, you drugged-out Communist. I paid for this body and I'd no sooner return it than I would my little cocker spaniel dog, Checkers.  Shut up, damnit!
",1643550,Fry," Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency.
",623551,Bender," That was a good one!
",223552,Nixon," Seriously though, I'm never giving back this body. Now beat it! Before I get Cambodian on your asses!
",1033553,Bender,"  It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.
",773554,Fry," No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!
",1263555,Leela," I've got a better plan.
",253556,Fry,"  Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?
",413557,Leela,"  They give you a discount if you've been here before.
",553558,Fry," Keep going, we're right behind you.
",373559,Bender," Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!
",343560,Man #1,"  We're in a room!
",193561,Bender," Well then lose some weight.
",293562,Nixon,"  Aroo!
",83563,Nixon,"  Oh, yeah. You women's libbers really know how to party!
",583564,Bender,"  Psst! There I am!
",203565,Nixon,"  Hey, Betty Friedan, send a little of that lotion my way!
",593566,Leela," OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic.
",493567,Fry," Ooh!  Uh-oh!
",143568,Nixon," What the--  You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve!
",513569,Bender," I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck.
",623570,Nixon," Bring it on, soup can.
",243571,Leela," Alright, break it up, you two!
",323572,Nixon," That's it. You're all going to jail. And don't expect me to grant a pardon like that sissy, Ford.
",993573,Leela," You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president. The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time.
",1523574,Nixon," Oh, no? Well, listen here, missy. Computers may be twice as fast as they were in 1973 but your average voter is as drunk and stupid as ever. The only one who's changed is me. I've become bitter and, let's face it, crazy over the years. And once I'm swept into office, I'll sell our children's organs to zoos for meat and I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place.
",3843575,Fry," Well, he lost my vote.
",243576,Nixon," Like one vote ever made a difference. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to inch myself over to the phone and call the police.
",1293577,Bender," Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?
",553578,Nixon," Uh-oh. I don't like where this is heading.
",443579,Nixon,"  And I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place!
",683580,Nixon," My God? I really sound like that? I thought my voice had more of a Clark Gable quality.
",893581,Leela," The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you the tape for the body.
",613582,Nixon," Oh, expletive deleted. You've got a deal.
",433583,Fry," Hey, I've got one last thought.
",333584,Bender," Ah, it's good to be back in one piece again. Except I can't get these damn bumper stickers off.
",973585,Linda,"  The sheer drama of this election has driven voter turnout to its highest level in centuries. 6%
",983586,Morbo,"  Exit polls show evil underdog Richard Nixon trailing with an estimated zero votes.
",853587,Leela," Yes! The system works!
",243588,Linda,"  The time is 7:59 and the robot polls are now opening ... and the robot vote is in. Nixon has won!
",1003589,Leela," No!
",53590,Fry," What?
",73591,Bender," Get out of town!
",183592,Fry," Why would robots vote for Nixon now that he's just a head in a jar?
",693593,Nixons campaign manager," I give you the next president of Earth!
",413594,Nixon,"  Nixon's back!
",163595,Farnsworth," I can't believe it. He won by a single vote.
",463596,Bender," Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you.
",603597,Fry," Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote.
",563598,Leela," Oh, crud. I knew there was something I meant to do today.
",593599,Morbo,"  Morbo congratulates our gargantuan cyborg president. May death come quickly to his enemies.
",943600,Nixon," Aroo! Who's kicking who around now?  Aroo! Aroo!
",503601,Nixon," Knock, knock!
",153602,Announcer #1," Ladies and gentlemen, Conan O'Brien's head.
",453603,OBrien," Thank you, thank you. Let's get started. Max, play me over.  Looks like someone forgot to feed Max.  So, people are getting pretty worried about this Y2K problem, huh?
",1693604,Bender," No, they fixed that 900 years ago.
",363605,OBrien," Just bear with me, sir. Anyway, I'm walking to work this morning--
",683606,Bender," I doubt it!
",133607,OBrien," Listen, pal, I may have lost my freakishly long legs in the war of 2012 but I've still got something you'll never have: A soul!
",1293608,Bender," Eh.
",53609,OBrien," And freckles!  Well, I'm out of material. You can catch me next week at the Andromeda Chuckle Hut. Enjoy your breakfast.
",1223610,Bender," Ah, let's face it: Comedy's a dead art form. Now, tragedy...  That's funny!
",773611,Farnsworth," Come on, everyone. Perhaps some skiing will help us forget the mouldy old antics of Conan O'Brien.
",1003612,Amy," Yeah!
",73613,Leela," Great idea!
",133614,Zoidberg," We can only hope!
",193615,Fry," This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened.
",653616,Leela," Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out.
",653617,Fry," Hi!
",53618,Bender," Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going.
",523619,Hermes," Jah damnit! We're stuck.
",263620,Zoidberg,"  At least you're not cold-blooded!
",363621,Hermes," Sweet lion of Zion! Look at the Professor go.
",473622,Fry," Look out! We're heading straight for those trees!
",513623,Leela," Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down.
",323624,Trees,"  Trees down.
",143625,Fry," Cool. Hey, what do you do if you want the trees up?
",533626,Trees,"  Trees up.
",123627,Fry,"  Trees down!
",143628,Trees,"  Trees down.
",143629,Bender," Lookin' good, meatball!
",253630,Man #1," Excuse me, sir, you're snowboarding off the trail.
",523631,Bender," Lick my frozen, metal ass.  Uh-oh!
",363632,Child,"  Mommy!
",93633,Zoidberg," You, a bobsledder? That I'd like to see!
",423634,Hermes," Listen, you filthy crab, a thousand years ago there was a legendary team of Jamaican bobsledders.
",993635,Fry," Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote alcoholic beverages.
",973636,Hermes," A true inspiration for the children.  Um, a little help please?   Nooo!
",733637,Fry," Oh, what the hell!  Ow!
",253638,Amy," You poor man. What happened to you?
",373639,Man #1 #2," Well, there I was on the triple diamond slope, when suddenly--
",643640,Amy," Oh, excuse me.  Hello, there!
",313641,Farnsworth," Wha?
",63642,Bender," Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.
",653643,Fry," Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit.
",513644,Farnsworth," What-mas?
",113645,Fry," Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S.
",313646,Leela," Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like when you say ""ask"" instead of ""aks"".
",1063647,Fry," Xmas, huh?  Y'know, this'll be my first Xmas away from home.
",623648,Leela," Hey, hey. Let me aks you something: Would it cheer you up if we went and cut down an Xmas tree?
",973649,Fry," Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree!
",353650,Fry," Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!
",313651,Farnsworth," Eh, wha?
",103652,Fry," They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree.
",573653,Farnsworth," Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and your primitive notions of modesty.  Ah! Brisk!
",1283654,Fry," This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.
",493655,Farnsworth," There, there.
",153656,Fry," Everything's changed.
",233657,Leela," That's not true.
",183658,Bender," Â : Xmas tree, oh, Xmas tree! Bah-boo-bee-boo-bah-bee-boh.
",593659,Amy," Ow!
",53660,Fry," Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes.  This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas.
",2483661,Hermes," Happy Xmas, Xmas people! Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas!  Amy, there you go. Fry, Professor, Zoidberg, a mighty haul for Bender.
",1293662,Bender," Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!
",343663,Hermes," And last, but not least, the sweet flower of the office: Me. Hermes Conrad.
",773664,Bender," Hmm.  Ah, a picture of my mommy.
",343665,Zoidberg," Huh? What's this?  A card from my cousin Zoidfarb.  Instead of ""Claus"" he writes ""Claws""! Now that's humorous. Today's comedians could learn from this card.
",1583666,Fry," What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the loneliest person on Earth.  Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy here, huh?  Yoiks! What was that about?
",1923667,Amy," Fluh! She's an orphan.
",243668,Farnsworth," Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life.
",853669,Fry," My God! Poor Leela.
",213670,Bender,"  Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well, old Bender'll make you laugh.  Look at me, look!  Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!
",1333671,Fry," I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself.
",1143672,Amy," I'll do it for you.
",213673,Fry," Ow! Thanks.
",133674,Farnsworth," You should be ashamed of yourself, Fry. You'd have to be blind not to notice that Leela's a cyclops.
",1023675,Hermes," Fry's over there, man.
",243676,Farnsworth," Oh?
",53677,Bender," Xmas Eve; another pointless day where I accomplish nothing.
",613678,Linda,"  The holiday season is a time of celebration for most. But it is also a time to remember the tragic suffering of the less fortunate.
",1343679,Morbo,"  Earthlings do not yet know the meaning of suffering.
",553680,Linda,"  Earlier today I visited a shelter for down-and-out robots.  Homeless robots, too poor to afford even the basic alcohol they need to fuel their circuits. Is there anything sadder? Only drowning puppies. And there would have to be a lot of them.
",2463681,Amy," Where are you going, Bender?
",303682,Bender," To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.
",553683,Hermes," Yeah, right! As if you ever did anything charitable.
",543684,Bender," I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?
",553685,Fry," Whose blood?
",143686,Bender," Some guy's.
",133687,Fry," I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am.
",563688,Zoidberg," So what's the problem? Just get down on your claws and do the apology dance.
",783689,Fry," So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out and get her the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to be unhappy again.
",1653690,Hermes," Just be back by sundown, mon.
",313691,Fry," We'll see. I like to haggle.
",303692,Amy," You can't stay out on Xmas Eve. You'll be killed!
",513693,Fry," Say what?
",113694,Farnsworth," Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus.
",473695,Fry," I know about Santa Claus.
",273696,Farnsworth," Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine who'd be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But something went wrong.
",1773697,Fry," Wow! 2801! Anyway...
",223698,Farnsworth," Wait, you fool! Due to a programming error, Santa's standards were set too high and he invariably judges everyone to be naughty.
",1303699,Amy," If he catches you after dark, he'll chop off your head and stuff your neck full of toys from his sack of horrors.
",1153700,Farnsworth," Nice meeting you.
",193701,Preacherbot," Welcome, brother! May the blessings of the season be upon you.
",643702,Bender," Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze.  Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
",1473703,Fry," There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?
",813704,Salesman #1 #1," Yeah, there's a suicide booth in the food court. Though there's a line this time of year.
",913705,Fry," No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown.
",613706,Salesman #1 #1," Well, you can't go wrong with something traditional.  A Surface-to-Santa rocket launcher. It comes with three jolly-seeking missiles.
",1353707,Fry," That's funny!
",153708,Salesman #1 #1," Careful, sir!
",153709,Bender," Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure know how to live.  Hey, chief, someone's stealing your handkerchief full of crap.
",1153710,Tinny Tim," Excuse me, sir? Might I have a sip of booze?
",463711,Preacherbot," I'm sorry, Tinny Tim. Seems we ran out early tonight.
",553712,Tinny Tim," I understand.
",153713,Bender," My God! That poor kid!
",243714,Fry," You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela.  Just give me your best animal.
",993715,Salesman #1 #2," Best? Well that's a matter of opinion. I personally like the Electric Snail.
",783716,Fry," That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now which costs more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?
",1223717,Salesman #1 #2," The lizards are a buck each, the parrot is $500.
",503718,Fry," That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?
",1243719,Salesman #1 #2," Sir, the store is closing in two minutes.
",433720,Fry," Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The parrot!
",833721,Fry," Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you.  Hey, you're quite the talker, aren't you?  Shut the hell up!  Ow!  Stupid bird! I know where you live.
",1713722,Amy," Hey, it's Leela.
",183723,Leela," Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.
",683724,Farnsworth," Huh? You were gone?
",213725,Leela," It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself.
",683726,Hermes," I hear that! I aks him to set the table, instead he goes out to buy you a present. Selfish dog.
",973727,Leela," Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!
",543728,Zoidberg," Why?
",63729,Leela," I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!
",533730,Fry," Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But you just met your equal.
",943731,Fry," Aha! Cornered!
",163732,Leela," Hi, there!
",123733,Fry," Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards!
",753734,Leela," You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry.
",433735,Fry," I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you never even had a family.
",1083736,Leela," It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But, together, we're lonely together.
",783737,Fry," Merry Xmas, Leela.
",203738,Leela," Merry Xmas.
",133739,Fry," Oh, boy! It's Santa!
",223740,Santa," Ho, ho, ho!  You've been very naughty, Fry and Leela. I checked my list.
",743741,Fry," Well check it twice!
",223742,Santa," I perform over 50 mega-checks per second. You're both naughty for disregarding each other's feelings.
",1033743,Leela," But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.
",723744,Santa," But what about your other co-workers? Did either of you ever stop to think about Dr. Zoidberg's feelings?
",1073745,Fry," No! I swear!
",143746,Santa," Santa has something very special in his sack for you two!
",593747,Robot #1s,"  So lock the door and hit the floor,
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.
",723748,Hattie McDoogal," Go away!
",103749,Bender," Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard cider?
",803750,Hattie McDoogal," Oh, alright. But just one glass!   OK, that's enough.  I said that's enough!
",783751,Bender,"  Get her purse!
",173752,Fry," Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!
",613753,Santa," You dare bribe Santa? I'm going to shove coal so far up your stocking you'll be coughing up diamonds!
",1033754,Leela," We're trapped.
",163755,Fry," I never thought it would end this way: Gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I didn't see it coming!
",1023756,Leela," Goodbye, Fry.
",153757,Fry," Goodbye, Leela.  Hey, look, we're under the mistletoe.
",563758,Santa," Your mistletoe is no match for my T.O.W. missile!
",513759,Fry," Uh, you're present may need some assembly.
",443760,Bender,"  On the 4th day of Xmas I stole from that lady.
",493761,Robot #1 #1,"  Four family photos.
",223762,Tinny Tim,"  Three jars of pennies.
",253763,Robot #1 #2,"  Two former husbands.
",233764,Bender,"  And a slipper on a shoe tree.
",323765,Raoul," Oh, thank you!
",163766,Fry,"  Help!
",83767,Leela,"  Somebody help us.
",203768,Tinny Tim," It's humans. Shall we mug them, robot sir?
",443769,Bender," No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing.
",483770,Santa," Ho, ho, ho!  You've been very naughty, Bender.
",483771,Bender," What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid.
",603772,Santa," My God, Bender! Framing an orphan? That's so naughty I'll have to add it to my list right now.  Framing ... I-N-G ...  ... an...
",1303773,Zoidberg," Amy, this is for you. A set of combs for your beautiful hair.
",633774,Amy," Oh, that's so sweet. But I sold my hair to a wigmaker so I could buy a set of combs for Hermes.
",973775,Hermes," Oh, the irony. I sold my hair so I could buy this third set of combs for Zoidberg.
",843776,Zoidberg," Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair.  Finally I look as pretty as I feel!
",893777,Fry,"  Help!
",83778,Leela,"  Help!
",83779,Bender,"  Help!
",83780,Farnsworth," Oh, dear. They'll be killed on our doorstep. And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.
",933781,Hermes," Sweet manatee of Galilee! He's on the roof!
",453782,Farnsworth," Quick! The armour-plated chimney cover!  Push! Push!
",543783,Bender," Use teamwork!
",153784,Tinny Tim," Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
",213785,Santa," You've all been very naughty, very naughty indeed. Except you, Dr. Zoidberg, this is for you.
",953786,Zoidberg," A pogo-stick!
",153787,Santa," As for the rest of you, I'm going to tear off your skin like wrapping paper and deck the halls with your guts.
",1123788,Bender," Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you don't believe in him, he can't hurt you.  Ow! God! The pain!
",1323789,Santa," Ho, ho, ho! Time to get jolly on your naughty asses!
",543790,Leela," Watch out! His belly is shaking like a bowl full of nitro-glycerine!
",703791,Amy," Rudolph's nose!
",173792,Fry,"  He's gonna blow!
",193793,Zoidberg," Aha!
",63794,Farnsworth," Yes, good thing I got us out of that one!
",433795,Bender," Xmas dinner, everyone.
",243796,Fry," Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?
",423797,Bender," I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone.
",773798,Tinny Tim," Thank you, sir.
",173799,Bender," You got the toenail!  Oh!
",273800,Fry," Look, the food isn't what's important.
",403801,Tinny Tim," I'm so hungry.
",163802,Fry," The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home.
",1533803,Farnsworth," Hear, hear! Now let's all of us shut up and sing!
",513804,Amy,"  He knows when you are sleeping.
",343805,Farnsworth,"  He knows when you're on the can.
",353806,Leela,"  He'll hunt you down and blast your ass from here to Pakistan.
",643807,Zoidberg,"  Oh.
",63808,Hermes,"  You'd better not breathe, You'd better not move.
",513809,Bender,"  You're better off dead, I'm telling you, dude.
",493810,Fry,"  Santa Claus is gunning you down!
",353811,Farnsworth," Merry Xmas, everyone!
",233812,Santa,"  I'll be back. Back when you least expect it: Next Xmas! Ho, ho, ho!
",703813,Singer,"  Call Robo-Rooter when you flush your towel.
",463814,Plumber-bot,"  And we can also help with an impacted bowel.
",473815,Singer,"  Robo-Rooter!
",153816,Fry," Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress: A Bavarian cream dog that's also self-microwaving!
",1163817,Bender," Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer.  Oh, what is this, the Middle Ages?
",1093818,Leela," Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap.
",743819,Fry," Sack?
",73820,Amy," And, Bender, your beer belly's so big your door won't even close. And that doesn't even make sense.
",1013821,Leela," Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym.
",443822,Zoidberg," The gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. For some reason I'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday.
",883823,Amy," Hey, who's up for a nice, hot steam?
",383824,Zoidberg," We crustaceans don't like steam. I'm going to go work out with the Nautilus!
",783825,Nautilus," What up, Dr. Z?
",173826,Zoidberg," Yo, yo, yo! Whassup, whassup! Give up the rock!
",493827,Fry," Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!
",393828,Leela," Uh, Fry, you're in the women's steam room.
",443829,Fry," Ah, futuristic!
",173830,Amy," Psst, look what life was like before genetic engineering.
",593831,Leela," Those poor 20th century women.
",323832,Amy,"  Hey, handsome. Is there room in there for two?
",493833,Man #1," You wish!
",113834,Fry," Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!
",403835,Leela," Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you.
",713836,Zoidberg," Give me that.  More weight!
",293837,Fry," Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?
",513838,Zoidberg," Enough with the questions. More weight!  More!  More!
",553839,Leela," Maybe you could do more reps with less weight.
",483840,Bender," Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell.  Get it?  He's coming out--
",893841,Randy," Nice and gentle, we don't want any unnecessary stress.  Is there a doctor in the gym?
",873842,Zoidberg," I'm a doctor!
",153843,Leela," I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always seemed the most normal.
",983844,Zoidberg," I am normal.  Amy, take off these rubber bands and I'll show you how normal I am!
",833845,Amy," Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool me eight or more times, shame on me.
",783846,Fry," Maybe he has a parasite.
",263847,Hermes," Maybe he is a parasite!
",253848,Bender," It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!
",1053849,Farnsworth," Now, now, this won't do. Let me just give old Zoidy a sedative.
",653850,Zoidberg," Ah, much better. You can take off these rubber bands now.
",593851,Amy," I'll do it.
",133852,Leela,"  Stop!
",83853,Fry,"  No, Amy!
",113854,Bender," Moron!
",83855,Farnsworth," Mm-hm...  Oh-ho!  Aha! There's the problem.
",453856,Zoidberg," Give it to me straight, Professor. Is it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't it? Tell me it's not fin rot!
",1013857,Farnsworth," Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no problem. You're just heavy with male jelly.
",813858,Leela," Bleck!
",83859,Farnsworth," It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people; a chaotic time when his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.
",1263860,Fry," Eck!
",63861,Farnsworth," There's only one thing we can do--
",363862,Bender," I'll get the water boiling!
",293863,Farnsworth," We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld which will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex.
",1303864,Fry," Oh, baby, I'm there!
",223865,Leela," Fry, do you even understand the word ""invertebrate""?
",543866,Fry," Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in.  Uh, no need to pack pants, people. Let's roll!
",983867,Amy," Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these while he's gone.
",563868,Bender,"  Moron!
",93869,Decapodian Man #1 #1," Welcome home, old friend. Just 19 hours until the mating frenzy!
",663870,Zoidberg," Excellent, excellent!
",233871,Decapodian Man #1 #1," See you there, Doctor--
",253872,Fry," Is that how you say ""Zoidberg""?
",333873,Zoidberg," You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.
",613874,Bender," You're looking less nuts, crabby.
",353875,Zoidberg," I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly in the cloacal vents of a female.  If you catch my drift.
",1403876,Fry,"  Who's the lucky lobsterina?
",303877,Zoidberg," I don't know yet. But I shall attract one this afternoon with an erotic display.
",823878,Leela," It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.
",573879,Zoidberg," Love? That word is unknown here. I'm simply looking for a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material.
",1153880,Fry," You and me both, brother!
",273881,Zoidberg," Ah, my old scuttling grounds! Let's pull over.
",483882,Zoidberg," I used to hang out here as a larva. It looked so much bigger back then.  Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?
",1073883,Bender," Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!
",573884,Zoidberg," No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, where my species fight to the death over matters of honour. Also whether abbreviations count in Scrabble.  They don't!
",1573885,Fry," I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do your erotic display?
",1043886,Zoidberg," Same place as your species: The beach.
",403887,Zoidberg," How do I look?
",163888,Bender," Like whale barf.
",183889,Zoidberg," Then the illusion is complete.
",323890,Fry," Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too.
",713891,Decapodian Man #1 #2," Aw, yeah! Aw, wow!
",203892,Zoidberg," Perfect! This oughta make me stand out.  Craw!
",483893,Fry," Look how ridiculous they look.
",323894,Bender," Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; shooting DNA at each other make babies. I find it offensive.
",1203895,Zoidberg," Craw!
",73896,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1 #1," Keep your jelly away from my eggs!
",363897,Zoidberg," Craw?
",73898,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1 #2," So not interested.
",203899,Zoidberg," Craw!
",73900,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1 #3," Humph. I've heard that line before!
",373901,Zoidberg," Cra-- Oh, what's the point?
",293902,Leela," Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
",433903,Bender," 'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry.
",703904,Fry," Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.
",673905,Zoidberg," Edna? Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember, from high school?  You used to laugh at me because my face was covered with barnacles!
",1293906,Edna," Zoidberg? Well I didn't know you were back in town. I heard you went off and became a rich doctor.
",1003907,Zoidberg," I've performed a few mercy killings. So, as long as I'm in town I was wondering if maybe ... craw?
",1003908,Edna," Oh, gee, yeah, I'm just going through a lot of things right now and-- Look, Zoidberg, I carry more eggs than any other female and I owe it to our race to pick a mate who's stuffed with male jelly. Maybe a rock star.
",2173909,Zoidberg," Or maybe a doctor?
",203910,Edna," I'm sorry, Zoidberg. You're just an inferior male specimen. Nice seeing you again.
",843911,Zoidberg,"  No one will ever want to mate with me, not with a puny claw like this. Did you see those other guys? They looked like giant claws with bodies attached.
",1543912,Leela," At least you didn't smell as bad as them.
",433913,Zoidberg,"  You're right, my stink gland is weak. Smell!
",473914,Fry," Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love.  Just look her in the eye, start crying and say  ""I've never been so happy.""
",1463915,Leela," If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing that to me. Even Sean!
",1043916,Zoidberg," Hmm, this ""love"" intrigues me. Teach me to fake it.
",533917,Fry," OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?
",543918,Zoidberg," Ask her to mate with me.
",263919,Fry," No. Tell her she's special.
",293920,Zoidberg," But she's not. She's merely the female with the largest clutch of eggs.
",733921,Fry," Well, tell her that. And then?
",323922,Zoidberg," Then mating.
",143923,Fry," No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them.  Yes?
",613924,Zoidberg," Is ""desire to mate"" a feeling?
",323925,Fry," You're not even trying!
",253926,Zoidberg," It's all so complicated with the flowers and the romance and the lies upon lies.
",823927,Fry," OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing.
",693928,Zoidberg," What? Now there's a bird involved?
",363929,Fry," OK, go ahead.
",153930,Edna," What the-- Dr. Zoidberg, your mating display failed. Why are you trying to talk to me?
",883931,Zoidberg,"  I have no idea.
",183932,Fry,"  You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating.
",573933,Zoidberg,"  I just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating.  Fry, that doesn't make sense.
",863934,Edna," Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But OK.
",483935,Fry,"  Start with a compliment. Tell her she looks thin.
",523936,Zoidberg,"  You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
",683937,Edna," Why, yes. Thanks for noticing.
",323938,Fry,"  Now ask her how her day was.
",313939,Zoidberg," Why would I wanna know?
",253940,Fry,"  You wouldn't. Ask anyway.
",283941,Zoidberg,"  How was your day?
",203942,Edna," Well first I got up and had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth. Then I went to the store to buy some fish. Then...
",1233943,Zoidberg," Fry, look what you did, she won't shut up.
",443944,Fry,"  That's normal. Just nod your head and say ""Uh-huh"".
",543945,Zoidberg,"  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
",183946,Edna," ...And then you threw an octopus at my window. You know, Zoidberg, it's crazy but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies as a male seem ... less obvious. Your genes seem less detrimental.  You even stink more.
",2213947,Zoidberg," Do I ask her to mate now?
",273948,Fry,"  Third date!
",143949,Bender," So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender.
",1023950,Zoidberg,"  I'd like to propose a toast to ... coat check number 84.
",593951,Fry,"  Turn it over.
",163952,Zoidberg," Oh, Edna!  Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet, you are apparently the hottest.
",983953,Bender," Oy.
",53954,Fry,"  That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
",513955,Edna," Yes, well ... excuse me, I've got to powder my mouth flaps.
",613956,Leela," Uh, me too.
",133957,Zoidberg," I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when you care about a female for reasons beyond mating?
",1223958,Fry," Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.
",413959,Leela," Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on your planet?
",1613960,Edna," Fry? You mean words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous alien?
",823961,Leela," Yeah ... what? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor, honey.
",823962,Edna," Hmm.
",63963,Edna,"  Come in.
",113964,Edna,"  Hello, Fry. Can I interest you in some surf and turf?
",563965,Fry," No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo.
",1083966,Edna," Well that is where it comes out but jelly isn't everything.  I know Zoidberg's magical words were really yours. Teach me to love you, squishy poet from beyond the stars!
",1713967,Fry," Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd be way up the list!
",1023968,Edna," Hush, you romantic fool! Engage your mandibles and kiss me!
",613969,Zoidberg," Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. I--   Fry!
",503970,Fry," Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks.
",383971,Zoidberg,"  Her caviar is on your neck!
",303972,Fry," But--
",73973,Edna," Oh, it's true, Zoidberg. We can't hide it any longer. Fry and I have fallen in love and we're going to mate tomorrow.
",1193974,Fry," What?
",73975,Zoidberg,"  Fry!  I challenge you to Claw-Plach!
",393976,Fry," English, please?
",183977,Zoidberg," A fight to the death.
",233978,Edna," And if you survive, we'll make sweet love!
",443979,Decapodian Emperor," The law is clear. Fry and Zoidberg shall fight to the death for the claw of the beautiful Edna.
",973980,Fry," But I don't want her!
",233981,Decapodian Emperor," Once invoked, the sacred tradition of Claw-Plach can not be taken back. It is a recent tradition, only 18 years old, but it is a tradition none the less.
",1553982,Zoidberg," Get ready, Fry. I'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you.
",763983,Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational.
",573984,Zoidberg,"  Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love!
",473985,Leela," Aww.
",63986,Fry," Leela!
",83987,Leela," Right, right.  You have to stop this madness.
",473988,Decapodian Emperor," Listen, lady, as you can plainly see I'm a highly desirable male, groaning with jelly. Yet I embrace a life of celibacy in order to uphold our crazy traditions. One of your friends must die.
",1923989,Bender," Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be.  Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope! Come on, baby!
",1603990,Zoidberg," Fry, it's been years since medical school so remind me. Disembowelling in your species: Fatal or non-fatal?
",1093991,Fry," Fatal.
",83992,Zoidberg," Large bet on myself in round one!
",353993,Decapodian Emperor," Edna, have you anything to say before begins the Claw-Plach?
",623994,Edna," I do. I just want to say that today I got up and I had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth--
",1003995,Fry,"  Shut up!
",113996,Edna," I love you, Fry!
",183997,Decapodian Emperor," Fry, having guessed what animal I was thinking of, you shall have first choice of weapon.  And you, doctor?
",1093998,Zoidberg," I choose my own claws! I want the tactile pleasure of chopping him right here in the gonads!
",943999,Fry," Shh! Nobody correct him!
",264000,Bender," Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but, if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win.
",1334001,Fry," But it's a fight to the death!
",324002,Bender," Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!
",484003,Decapodian Emperor," Please rise for the national anthem.
",384004,Fry," Uh-oh.
",84005,Decapodian Emperor,"  Let Claw-Plach begin!
",244006,Fry," Hey!
",64007,Bender," Ow!
",54008,Leela,"  Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!
",344009,Fry," Aha!  Oops!
",134010,Edna,"  Nooo! I can't stand to look.
",314011,Zoidberg," Huh?
",64012,Bender," Psst, Fry. Take a dive.
",254013,Crowd,"  Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!  Claw-Plach!  Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!
",764014,Fry," My fellow fish monsters, far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or its dumb customs, but is squeezing each other's brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend, and though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why?  One reason.  You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!
",3734015,Leela," Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.
",314016,Zoidberg," Edna? Honey?
",144017,Zoidberg," Edna?
",74018,Leela," Ew!
",54019,Bender," Oh, my God!
",134020,Zoidberg," The frenzy!  Oh, the greatest experience in life and I missed it.
",674021,Fry," Aw. I'm sorry, Doc.
",214022,Fry," Ow, ow! Ah!
",134023,Zoidberg," The frenzy is over. How will I ever get rid of my male jelly now?
",674024,Fry,"  I'll lend you this.
",224025,Leela," Fry!
",64026,Fry," Hey, hey.
",114027,Bender," Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?
",524028,Zoidberg," They come to feast after the frenzy. Once my species passes on its genes, it dies.
",844029,Fry," You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome death?
",784030,Zoidberg," Yes.
",64031,Fry," Tough call.
",134032,Zoidberg," Well it was nice of you to let me reattach your arm, Fry, especially after I made a complete eel out of myself.
",1134033,Fry," No biggie.
",124034,Zoidberg," Yes biggie. I learned to feel things I'd never felt before: Love, jealousy, passion for disembowelling. I owe it all to you.  There! I pronounce the operation a success.
",1714035,Leela," Hooray!
",94036,Bender," Yeah!
",74037,Fry,"  Yeah!
",84038,Zoidberg," I may not know from emotions but when it comes to medicine, forget about it.
",784039,Fry," I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could take one more whack at this?
",994040,Zoidberg," For you, my friend, anything.
",314041,Fry,"  My legs!
",114042,Zoidberg,"  Alright, alright, third time's the charm.
",444043,Announcer #1,"  Futurama is brought to you by ...  ... Arachno Spores! The fatal spore, with the funny name!

",574047,Centipede man,"  What? Crazy upstairs lady must've been shooting down.
",564048,URL,"  Sir, you're on the top floor of this particular domicile.
",604049,Centipede woman,"  You get that  camera out of my house!
",404050,Smitty,"  Just relax, ma'am.  Sir, sir, put down the lamp.
",514051,Centipede man,"  OK. OK, I'm co-operating.
",284052,Smitty,"  That's it. Now put up your hands.
",364053,URL,"  Nice and slow. Aw, yeah!
",274054,Smitty,"  And while you're at it, unblur your face.
",444055,Centipede man,"  Aw, man.
",114056,Leela," Hey, Bender, I thought you said you were in this episode.
",594057,Bender," Nah, this week I'm on Caught On Tape 3 'cause of what I did in the coffee pot.
",804058,Centipede man,"  I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. I'm just going through some things.
",674059,URL,"  I'm goin' in!
",164060,Announcer #1 #1,"  Cop Department will return, after these messages.
",524061,Announcer #1 #2,"  Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?
",624062,Bender,"  Shut up and get to the point!
",324063,Announcer #1 #2,"  Then come relive the carefree days of yore at Past-O-Rama ...  ... where Old New York comes alive.

",424069,Leela," Sounds like your kinda place, Fry. Wanna go?
",464070,Fry," Nah. If I ever wanna go back to the year 2000 I'll just freeze myself again.
",784071,Bender," C'mon, Fry, I really wanna see it. You know how I yearn for a simpler time. A time of barn dances and buggy rides, before life was cheapened by heartless hi-tech machines.
",1734072,Leela," But, Bender, you are--
",244073,Bender," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...
",754074,Fry," Cool, it's just like the good old days!
",414075,Mugger," Give me your wallet or I'll cut you!
",384076,Fry," Hey, Leela, get a picture of me being ""mugged"".
",494077,Mugger," I'll take the camera too.
",274078,Bender," Learning is fun.
",184079,Leela," Ooh, ancient Wall Street.
",274080,Stockbroker #1," No!
",54081,Stockbroker #2," I'm ruined!
",134082,Tour Guide," I direct your attention to this ancient and mysterious tablet which has yet to be deciphered.
",954083,Leela," Do you know what it means?
",284084,Fry," Yeah, I asked a cop once. It means ""Up yours, kid"".
",534085,Bender," I gotta say I'm really enjoying the day out with you people. Hey, a suicide booth! So long, suckers.
",1024086,Fry," Uh, sorry, Bender, that's just a phone booth.
",474087,Bender,"  Oh.
",64088,Leela," What were they used for?
",264089,Fry," In New York? Bathrooms.
",254090,Leela," Oh. I-I'll be out in a sec.
",294091,Leela,"  Tokens only.  How does this work?
",364092,Fry," I'll show you.  Whup.
",234093,Bender," Oh, it's a turnstile.
",234094,Leela," What's this?  Another bathroom?
",334095,Fry," No, it's a mobile apartment with no rent.
",434096,Bender," C'mon, Fry. Get up!
",214097,Leela," Wow! The burial chamber of the 20th century's greatest spiritual leader, Al Sharpton.
",874098,Bender," Ooh. Now this guy had taste!
",304099,Leela," It says he was mummified in ceremonial vestments.
",514100,Fry," We sometimes called it a jogging suit.
",404101,Narrator,"  The traffic jams of Old New York were a public forum of free interchange of opinions.
",884102,Motorist #1,"  Move it, crap for brains!
",284103,Motorist #2,"  Bug off!
",114104,Motorist #3,"  Get home, bastard man!
",254105,Narrator,"  It all started with Gerald Ford's famous invention, the ""automocar"" ...  ... which was powered by a tank of burning fossils. Here we see a 20th century assembly line where cars were constructed by primitive robots.
",2174106,Robot #1s,"  Ooga! Ooga! Ooga! Ooga! Ooga! Ooga...
",404107,Bender," We've come a long way, baby!
",304108,Narrator,"  The fruit of the robots' labour was this ...  ... the stately 1992 Latoura.
",784109,Fry," Hey, my girlfriend had one of those. Actually it wasn't hers, it was her dad's. Actually she wasn't my girlfriend, she just lived next door and never closed her curtains.
",1724110,Leela," Fry, remember when I told you about always ending your stories a sentence earlier?
",844111,Fry," C'mon, let's sneak in for a closer look.
",424112,Man #1," Sir, we don't touch the antiques. sir. You-- Oh!  I'm sorry. You work here. I should have realised from that ridiculous getup you're wearing.
",1434113,Fry," Hey! This is from Miller's Outpo-- Uh, I mean, yeah, I work here alright!
",754114,Man #1," Here, move this rust bucket outside behind St. Koch's Cathedral.
",664115,Leela," Did you drive much in the 20th century, Fry?
",464116,Fry," Nope.  No one in New York drove. There was too much traffic.  Nice! Listen to that baby purr.
",954117,Bender," There's a baby in there, huh?
",314118,Fry," It's just like riding a bicyc--
",334119,Bender," I think I got whiplash.
",254120,Leela," You can't have whiplash, you don't have a neck.
",494121,Bender," I meant ass whiplash.
",234122,Fry," I'm just glad we hit something. I thought we'd never stop.
",604123,Bending Unit," Ow! I think I got whiplash.
",294124,Fry," How's that robot I ran over?
",304125,Farnsworth," We did all we could.
",224126,Fry," You mean he's--
",174127,Farnsworth," Good as new? Yes!
",194128,Farnsworth," Leela, Zoidberg, the rest of you, this is Flexo.
",504129,Hermes," Sweet llamas of the Bahamas! Except for that stylish beard, he looks just like Bender!
",884130,Flexo," No duh, dreadlock, we're both bending units.
",464131,Bender," Hey, brobot, what's you serial number?
",404132,Flexo," 3370318.
",104133,Bender," No way! Mine's 2716057!
",254134,Fry," I don't get it.
",174135,Bender," We're both expressible as the sum of two cubes.
",494136,Fry," So, uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your body like that. You OK now?
",704137,Flexo," Well I don't feel as bad as you look!  Nah, I'm just messing with you, kid. You're alright. That's some face you got, though. I think they got a cream for that.  Nah, you're great.
",1824138,Fry," Well just let me know if there's anything I can do to make it up to you.
",744139,Flexo," Actually, your little stunt did a number on my back. You mind rubbin' it for me?
",824140,Fry," Uh ... sure.
",144141,Flexo," Aw, yeah, that's it. Little lower.
",364142,Fry," How's that?
",134143,Flexo," Lower.  Yeah that's gettin' it. A little lower though.
",564144,Fry," Uh, I can't get any lower than this.
",384145,Flexo," I'll say, you're rubbing my ass!
",344146,Robot #1 #1," Hey, check it out here. Six beautiful devices. They know what you like and they'll do it to within a tolerance of one micron!
",1274147,Robot #1 #2," Yeah! Spin those fans, baby!
",304148,Robot #1 #3," Alright, mama!
",164149,Robot #1 #4," Gyrate, baby!
",154150,Fry," I don't like this place. It's 120 degrees and there's very little oxygen.
",754151,Bender," Shut up and hoot.  Hubba-hubba, she is built -- in Mexico, I believe.
",714152,Flexo," And that ain't silicon, it's tungsten. And plenty of it!
",584153,Fry,"  Uh, yeah. Look at that exhaust fan.
",384154,Flexo," Ew!
",54155,Bender," Pervert.
",104156,Flexo," Yoo-hoo!
",104157,Stripperbot," Thanks, moderate spender. Please select erotic transaction.
",614158,Flexo," Yeah, how 'bout a lap dance for my pal here?
",464159,Fry," Uh, no, no, that's alright.  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
",464160,Fry," I'm telling you, there's something about Flexo I don't like.
",624161,Flexo," Hey, Fry, think fast.  Get it? It's chlorine!
",474162,Zoidberg," It's funny because it's poisonous!
",364163,Fry," Yeah, keep laughing, brine shrimp, but he's bad news. I regret ever running him over.
",874164,Hermes," Take a rage dump, man. He's no worse than Bender.
",514165,Fry," He's much worse. He drinks and smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the Internet.
",904166,Amy," That's Bender, alright.
",254167,Fry," I'm talking about Flexo.
",264168,Leela," Oh, I get it. This is cute. You're jealous of Bender's new friend!
",684169,Fry," No, I'm not. Mark my words: Flexo's evil. He's the evil Bender.
",654170,Hermes," Rage dump!
",124171,Farnsworth,"  Good news, everyone. Report to my bedroom for a private exhibition.
",704172,Farnsworth," Everyone get in bed with me. I have something to show you.  Feast your eyes on this!
",864173,Leela," It's beautiful.
",174174,Amy," And huge.
",114175,Fry," Can I touch it?
",174176,Zoidberg," So what is it, already?
",254177,Farnsworth," It's a single atom of jumbonium, an element so rare the nucleus alone is worth more than $50,000.
",994178,Bender," How much more?
",164179,Farnsworth," 100,000. That's why I hid it here, under my mattress.
",554180,Leela," Uh, Professor, can we discuss this somewhere else?
",524181,Farnsworth," Why certainly.
",164182,Farnsworth," The atom sits atop this dimestore tiara which will be awarded to the winner of this year's Miss Universe pageant on the planet Tova 9.  Your job is to deliver it, safe and sound.
",1804183,Amy," Wow! When I was a little girl on Mars I dreamed of being Miss Universe.
",734184,Leela," That's kinda pathetic.
",244185,Amy," Aw, come on, Leela. Deep down all girls wanna be Miss Universe.
",654186,Leela," Not me.
",94187,Amy," Really? Maybe it's just cute girls.
",374188,Farnsworth," Due to the atoms tremendous value, Planet Express would go bankrupt if it was stolen. Therefore we'll need to hire on additional security for the mission.
",1564189,Flexo," Oh, oh, oh, oh! Mr. Professor, right here!
",444190,Fry," Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great, but--
",874191,Farnsworth," ""Flexo's great,"" you say? Well that's good enough for me.  Welcome aboard, lad.
",814192,Leela," Space bandidos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
",1424193,Fry," Wait, hold on. I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically.
",784194,Leela," OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
",414195,Fry," Wait, let's go by rank.
",254196,Leela," OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
",414197,Fry," Flexo outranks me?
",204198,Flexo," That's ""Flexo outranks me, sir""!
",344199,Bender," Halt. Who goes there?
",234200,Fry," Don't point that at me.
",254201,Bender," ""Fry"" who?
",124202,Fry," Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom.
",774203,Bender," My God, Fry! Just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil? Well I got a label for you, pal: An ugly little word called ""prejudice"".
",1444204,Fry," I'm not prejudiced.
",214205,Bender," Ah, save it for the cross-burning, Adolf!
",434206,Flexo," Keeping an eye on the safe?
",294207,Bender," You know it!
",144208,Flexo," Well, looks like it's my shift. You lie down and go offline for a while.
",744209,Bender," Alright.
",104210,Fry," Caught you!  I saw you looking at the atom!
",454211,Flexo," So? I look at lots of atoms. Shouldn't you be resting up for your shift?
",744212,Fry," Oh-ho, you'd like it if I went to sleep, wouldn't you?
",564213,Flexo," Whatever it takes to shut your yapper.  Nah, I'm just kidding, you're a joker.
",804214,Fry," Yeah, well here's a funny joke: I'm gonna sit right here till it's my shift.
",784215,Flexo," Suit yourself, skinbag.
",254216,Fry," That I will.
",144217,Flexo," Good.
",74218,Fry," Good.
",74219,Flexo," Good.
",74220,Fry," Good.
",74221,Flexo," Good.
",74222,Fry," Good.  Good.
",144223,Fry," Well, that's eight hours.
",274224,Flexo," Yeah, eight hours of solid boredom.  Nah, I'm kidding, you're a wonderful man.
",804225,Fry," Finally, the atom is safe.
",284226,Leela," What is it?  My God! Did you hear maracas?
",444227,Fry," No.
",54228,Leela," Then it wasn't space bandidos.  Bender, lock down the ship. Don't let Flexo escape.
",854229,Bender," Aye aye, Captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially me ... Bender.
",894230,Leela," How could Flexo have stolen the atom?
",394231,Fry," He must have used a sleep-ray on me. Sleep-rays exist in the future, right?
",774232,Leela," No.
",54233,Fry," Oh. Then I must've fallen asleep.
",354234,Leela," Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil.
",504235,Bender," I locked down the exits but he may have already gotten away.
",624236,Leela," OK, thanks, Bender. Let's fan out and look for him.
",534237,Bender," Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here.
",494238,Leela,"  Keep an eye on Fry. We can't rule out the possibility that he did it.
",724239,Leela," Aha!
",64240,Fry," Aha!  Uh, searching ... hmm.
",304241,Leela," Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?
",614242,Fry," I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.
",804243,Bender," Well, he wasn't in the, uh, kitchen room.
",434244,Fry,"  Say, Bender, can I hold that map for a second?
",494245,Bender," And leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.
",694246,Fry," Give it up!
",134247,Bender," Alright, take it. Sheesh!
",274248,Leela," Well, looks like Flexo got away clean.
",404249,Bender," It's a darn shame.
",204250,Leela," He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed.
",624251,Fry," Or maybe, he never left at all!  Wait a minute. You're Bender.
",644252,Bender," Of course, who said I wasn't?
",314253,Fry," But why were you wearing that scarf and the turtleneck and this fruity number?
",804254,Bender," It's a little thing called ""style"". Look it up sometime.
",584255,Barker," Our ninth finalist, Miss Methane Planet, Halatina Smogmeyer.  And our tenth and final finalist, Miss Earth's Moon, The Crushinator.
",1334256,Crushinator,"  Thank you, Bob Barker. I'm as happy as a girl can be. End statement.
",714257,Barker," Which one of these lovely womanoids will take home the atomic tiara?
",704258,Leela,"  Downplay the tiara.
",224259,Barker," Uh, we'll find out after these subliminal messages.
",534260,Barker," So you lost the atom, huh? You're garbage, human garbage! Do you brain-dead space jockeys have any idea how much that thing is worth?
",1354261,Fry," 100,000?
",104262,Leela," 200,000?
",104263,Bender," 200,001?
",104264,Barker,"  You're closest without going over.
",374265,Fry," Well, uh, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you received the atom.
",934266,Barker," I'm not signing squat. You find me that damn tiara before the pageant ends.
",774267,Leela," But, Mr. Barker--
",194268,Barker," Enough out of you. I may be against the fur industry, but that won't stop me from skinning you alive! As long as no one wears the skin.
",1374269,Leela," Well, gentlemen, it appears we're boned.
",424270,Fry," Flexo!
",84271,Leela," Get him!
",104272,Barker," Next up in what is generously called the ""Talent Competition"", performing a traditional gangsta rap, Miss-- What the--
",1204273,Bender," Gotcha!
",94274,Women,"  Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
",374275,Bender," Shoot him, he's choking me!
",294276,Flexo," No shoot him, he's choking me!
",324277,Leela," I don't know which one to shoot.
",344278,Fry," Flexo! Shoot Flexo!
",214279,Amazonian," Women-only room!
",184280,Leela," Alright, enough of this.  There's the atom!
",454281,Bender," Aw, jeez.
",114282,Fry," Bender? You stole the atom?
",294283,Bender," Yeah, but I can explain, it's very valuable.
",464284,Flexo," I saw him snatch it while Fry was asleep. That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker.
",804285,Fry," Whoa, whoa, wait a second. You mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked. Shocked! Well not that shocked.
",1104286,Leela," I'm sorry we suspected you, Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and all--
",774287,Flexo," Don't even bother. You people sicken me. I put my life on the line to guard that atom and this is how you repay me? Well you can go rot for all I care.  Nah, I'm just kidding, you guys are alright.
",1994288,Fry," I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?
",1474289,Bender," Eh, they're both fine choices. Whatever floats your boat.
",594290,URL," Is this the guy?
",184291,Barker," Huh? Oh, yeah, that looks like him. Whatever.
",474292,Flexo," Wait, but I--
",154293,Barker," Take him away.
",164294,Barker," Alright, let's put an end to this pathetic hoedown. Brannigan, read the thing.
",804295,Zapp," And the winner is...
",224296,Leela," It figures. Who else but Zapp Brannigan would be judging the most chauvinistic, degrading, dehumanising--
",1074297,Zapp," Huh? Leela?
",134298,Leela," Wait, you're making a--  Ooh! Look at that.  I feel like a princess!
",704299,Zapp," Wait. What are you people? Idiots? I'm still going mano a mano with this envelope.  And the winner is: Miss Vega 4.   There it is, Miss Universe. There it is, looking weird.
",1754300,Leela," I almost had that tiara.
",264301,Bender," Me too.
",94302,Fry," Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet.
",1084303,Leela," Fry, that's a radiator.
",254304,Fry," Oh.  Is there a burn ward within 10 feet of here?
",514305,Lincoln,"  Four score and 1145 years ago our forefathers' foreheads conceived a new nation.
",834306,Washington,"  And this Presidents' Day we honoureth those values that my body fought and died for.
",874307,Malfunctioning Eddie,"  Values like this brand new Plymouth V'Ger! Hi, I'm Malfunctioning Eddie and I'm malfunctioning so badly I'm practically giving these cars away!
",1464308,Amy," Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents promised if I got all B's they'd buy me a bar, and I got all C's!
",1064309,Bender," Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing.  The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision.
",1384310,Fry," No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately.
",664311,Leela," I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender.
",374312,Victor," Hello, I am Victor and I know many things about the art of unloading fine cars on beautiful women.
",1004313,Leela," Uh-huh. Now tell us she's witty and sophisticated.
",524314,Victor," Ah-ah-ah! A gentleman always sells a lady a car first.  This is the Beta Romeo. Yes, the Beta Romeo. Note the cross-your-heart seat belt which protects, lifts and separates.
",1754315,Thundercougarfalconbird salesman," Spotted her the minute you walked in, didn't you, sir? She's a real beauty.
",774316,Fry," Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright.
",384317,Salesman #1," No, the Ford Thundercougarfalconbird!  Nothing makes you feel more like a man than a Thundercougarfalconbird. So how much were you thinking of spending on this Thundercougarfalconbird?
",1864318,Fry," Sorry, I'm not here to buy.
",294319,Salesman #1," I understand, and it's wonderful you don't care whether anyone questions your sexual orientation.
",994320,Fry," I care! I care plenty! I just don't know how to make them stop!
",654321,Salesman #1," One word: Thundercougarfalconbird!
",364322,Victor," The luxurious seats are stuffed with eagle down and the dashboard inlaid with the beaks of a thousand eagles. Also, there are some eagles under the floorboards.
",1624323,Amy," That's an awful lot of eagle.
",314324,Victor," Yes, and yet--
",164325,Amy," What's wrong?
",154326,Victor," It is just ... the luxury edition has so much more eagle. It saddens me to think of you missing out.
",1024327,Amy," Oh, don't be sad. My parents are paying and they're incredibly rich.
",704328,Mechanic," I installed shock-absorbing bumpers to reduce the risk of catastrophic butt failure.
",864329,Bender," You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! I demand you restore my buttocks to their former glory.
",1014330,Mechanic," Alright. But sooner or later that ass is gonna blow, and when it does, I just pray you're not moonin' someone you care about.
",1274331,Amy," Smeesh, Leela! This car has everything a beautiful woman like me needs. Victor said so.
",894332,Victor,"  No dog food for Victor tonight.
",344333,Leela," OK, the sticker says 55,000, but we'll only go as high as, say--
",664334,Amy," 60,000!
",94335,Victor," Oh, I will have to ask my manager.
",364336,Leela," Amy, you don't go up from the sticker price.
",464337,Amy," I thought it was an auction.
",304338,Victor," He is not too happy.
",224339,Amy," I'm sorry. 80,000?
",204340,Amy," Uh-oh. I'm terrible at parallel parking.
",424341,Hermes,"  And now you're asking for a day off? Get out of my and my sight!  You're bogarting my patience.
",984342,Leela," Hermes, who were you yelling at?
",344343,Hermes," Myself. I asked myself a Valentine's Day off, but I was in no mood for any of my shenanigans.
",954344,Fry," Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well, since neither of us has a date, why don't we...?
",1284345,Leela," You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?
",494346,Fry," Shall we say eight o'clock?
",294347,Amy," Hey, I'm taking my new car out for a spin to Mercury. Anybody wanna come?
",754348,Fry," Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?
",364349,Amy," The usual: Boiling lead, oceans of lava.
",424350,Fry," So, what? Shorts?
",194351,Fry," Boy, this A.C. is incredible!  I'd better turn on the heater too.   Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more.
",1404352,Amy,"  Hey, how about some icy margaritas?
",384353,Fry,"  Yeah!  We're slowing down!
",294354,Amy,"  Don't worry. I'll hit the fuel guzzler!
",424355,Fry,"  Who wants pop-tarts?  Uh-oh!
",314356,Amy," It's OK, I have an emergency phone.
",374357,Fry," What are you doing?
",214358,Amy," Spluh! It's a video-phone.  Lucky I'm a member of the Astro-Afro-Antarctico-Amer-Asian Auto Association.  Hello? Septuple-A?
",1264359,Fry," Phew!
",74360,Amy," It'll be a couple hours. Oh, I'm gonna get sweat on my sweat-suit.
",684361,Fry," Hey, tell me something: You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
",1104362,Amy," I guess 'cause my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike.  As though!
",764363,Fry," I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?
",1034364,Amy," Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, ""Straighten your Pope hat,"" and, ""Put on your good vestments.""  You know, Fry, it's nice to find someone I can talk to about stuff, and junk.
",1894365,Fry," Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever.
",744366,Amy," So while they're towin' us, you wanna do it?
",464367,Fry," Yeah.
",74368,Hermes," Which concludes the summary of the movie I saw last night. Now, any old business?
",834369,All,"  No.
",64370,Hermes," Any new business?
",194371,All,"  No.
",64372,Hermes," Anyone spend the night together?
",344373,Amy," Yep.
",64374,Fry," Kind of.
",104375,Bender," What?
",74376,Hermes," Oh, my God!
",134377,Amy," We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another.
",614378,Fry," And it led there again when we got home.
",424379,Bender," Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics.
",1134380,Leela," Bender! Romance isn't about money.
",364381,Bender," Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!
",1024382,Leela," For your information, it's because he's hideous.
",504383,Hermes," Well I think Amy and Fry go together like a lime and coconut.
",634384,Farnsworth," Do I hear wedding bells?
",264385,Fry," What? No!
",114386,Farnsworth," Really? Oh, dear.
",194387,Zoidberg," You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness. If only I weren't so desperately poor.
",1134388,Bender," Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--
",1144389,Judge #1," $500 and time served.
",234390,Bender," Stupid anti-pimping laws!  Well, pay the man!
",474391,Hookerbot," Bender, honey, we love you!
",294392,Bender," Shut up, baby, I know it!
",274393,Bender," Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase ""upside your head"".
",984394,Leela," Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?
",734395,Bender," Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!
",414396,Hermes,"  Fry! Amy! Put your pants back on! I need a stapler.
",544397,Zoidberg," Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged and maul us with his fearsome gonad.
",1134398,Fry,"  It's working, they think we're making out.  Wait, why aren't we making out?
",784399,Amy," I 'unno.
",104400,Bender," OK, Mister...?
",164401,Zapp," Uh, Smith! Zapp Smith. Uh, Brannigan.
",394402,Bender," Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner.
",654403,Zapp," Let's see ... Oh, yes!  Yes, definitely.  Oh, I'd like some of that.  Mmm, I'll just have everything on the menu.
",1154404,Bender," Now to run it through our high-speed romance-a-logical data-fier.  Say hello to Miss Right!
",934405,Zapp,"  Hello!
",94406,Fry," Wow! We're great kissers!
",274407,Amy," Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out to Europa? We could have a picnic and spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter.
",1114408,Fry," Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk.
",1224409,Amy," Yeah. Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging out with you.
",564410,Fry," Everything was going great. Then, all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hanging out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela.
",1614411,Leela," You'll be back to zero soon enough.
",374412,Fry," Don't you get it? She's smothering me.
",404413,Amy," Hi.
",54414,Fry," You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.
",604415,Leela," Fry--
",74416,Fry," I'm doing my job, there's Amy; I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine, there's Amy; I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy, there's Amy!
",1614417,Leela," I think you're over reacting.
",314418,Fry," Am I?  Am I?  Face it, I'm a prize catch.  I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money.
",894419,Leela," Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money.
",554420,Fry," Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us. I can't be alone with her.
",1084421,Amy," So, ready for a secluded picnic with just you and me?
",554422,Fry," Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me?  Uh, Dr. Zoidberg.
",834423,Zoidberg," Did someone say something about a free hot meal?
",504424,Zoidberg," Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! Bird eggs, animal slices ...  ... dry woven reeds!  All gone! Can I drive?
",1124425,Amy," No. So, Fry, you busy tomorrow? I got two tickets to the big ape fight.
",734426,Fry," Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?
",844427,Amy," OK, sure. What do you wanna do for Valentine's Day?
",534428,Fry," Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?
",654429,Amy," But you just said--
",214430,Fry," That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive.
",554431,Zoidberg," Wahoo!
",84432,Fry,"  Pardon me, excuse me.
",244433,Zoidberg," Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!
",514434,Fry," Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?
",1314435,Amy," Huh? You don't like chocolate?
",324436,Fry," Look, could chocolate just let me finish?
",434437,Zoidberg," Vroom, vroom! And the winner of the big car race is ... Hot Rod Zoidberg!
",754438,Fry," Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--
",714439,Zoidberg," Uh-oh. Here, you drive!
",254440,Zoidberg," Fry? Are you alright?
",234441,Fry," Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?
",614442,Zoidberg," No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody but you. I'm afraid your body was badly damaged in the crash.
",1054443,Fry," How badly?
",124444,Zoidberg," That's it over there.  Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive with some quick surgery.
",964445,Fry," Where is it?
",144446,Zoidberg," There.
",84447,Amy," Looks like we'll be spending a lot more time together, Fry!
",614448,Leela," This sort of thing always happens with office romances.
",574449,Zoidberg," Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days.  Upsy daisy!
",814450,Fry," Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much.
",634451,Amy," Fry!
",64452,Fry," Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm.
",414453,Amy," So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?
",684454,Fry," Oh, that.  Maybe we'd better talk in private.  I'll meet you in the closet.
",774455,Fry," Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together.
",894456,Amy," You're breaking up with me?
",294457,Fry," I just think we should start seeing other people.
",514458,Amy," But, I was really having fun.  If that's how you feel.
",564459,Fry," I'm sorry, but it is.
",234460,Amy," Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long as we're not seeing each other, you mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's Day?
",1264461,Fry," Huh?
",64462,Amy," I mean, unless it would make you feel bad, being a third wheel.
",654463,Fry," Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!
",824464,Amy," With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman.
",644465,Fry,"  Oh!  Oh!
",114466,Leela," So, how's business?
",214467,Bender," Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' you, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day.
",1114468,Leela," Yeah, it's pathetic alright!  How much?
",414469,Bender," 500 bucks.
",124470,Leela," Done.
",74471,Bender," Zapp Brannigan OK?
",204472,Leela," No!
",54473,Bender," 600.
",64474,Fry," Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute?  In private?
",664475,Amy," Oh, no problem.
",174476,Fry," This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?
",1464477,Leela," You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!
",1134478,Fry," Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.
",1104479,Leela," Bender's in his office.
",254480,Fry," Thanks.
",94481,Bender," I got your hook-up, Fry. Now, my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance.
",1104482,Amy," OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra.
",414483,Fry," Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?
",1114484,Amy," What business is it of yours?
",314485,Fry," And another thing: You're using an awful lot of make-up there.
",644486,Amy," This is deodorant.
",204487,Fry," What does it do?
",184488,Amy,"  C'mon in, Gary! I'll just be another 20 minutes.
",514489,Gary,"  I'll be waiting.
",194490,Fry," 20 minutes? You're practically ready now!
",434491,Amy," Yeah, but it's good to make them wait a little.
",494492,Fry," Oh, God, it's true!
",214493,Gary," That dress looks great on you.
",324494,Amy,"  Thanks.
",104495,Fry,"  Thanks.  Where is she?
",254496,Gary," I must say, Amy, you're all made up, just like Fry's date. Get it?
",684497,Amy," Mm-mm.
",84498,Fry," I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.
",464499,Bender," Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!
",554500,Petunia," How's them eats?
",184501,Fry," Uh--
",64502,Petunia," Don't mind if I do.  Kids'll be hungry.
",414503,Fry,"  She seems a little old for me.
",334504,Bender," She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!
",604505,Petunia," Wheels fell off my house.
",274506,Bender," Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!
",544507,Gary," I'll take one.
",164508,Fry," Oh, yeah? Well I want one too.
",324509,Bender," Eight bucks.
",144510,Fry," But you just said--
",214511,Bender," Demand suddenly skyrocketed. You all saw it!
",464512,Bender," Leela, meet your future husband Sal.
",384513,Sal," Nice eyeball, eyeball.
",244514,Leela," Nice ass, ass.
",164515,Bender," Ooh, sparks!  Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!
",594516,Sal," Eh, I'll take my chances.
",274517,Zapp," Cheers!
",94518,Woman #1," Cheers!
",94519,Petunia," So tell me about your prospects. You a good gambler?
",544520,Fry," Well, ma'am, I--
",184521,Petunia," What's your game? Bingo? Keno? Wait a minute! You don't have your own body.
",774522,Fry," No, but I control this arm.
",294523,Petunia," Slots player, huh? Sorry, but I think I can do better.
",564524,Fry," Wait, come back, uh, darling.
",314525,Petunia," Can't, hon', I gotta catch my bus back to Nutley. I'd kiss you goodnight but I lost my teeth pulling out a stump.
",1154526,Sal," So anyways, Leela, I'd love to take a whack at ya but thatto Nutley ain't goin' nowheres without yours truly behinds the wheel.
",1294527,Petunia," Excuse me, did you say to Nutley""?
",364528,Sal," Why, yes I dids.
",184529,Leela,"  Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?
",624530,Bender," Of course not.
",164531,Sal,"  Anybodys else for Nutley?
",284532,Zapp," Baby, wait! You didn't show me your surprise.
",474533,Gary,"  You know what I'd like to do...?
",354534,Fry," Oh, jeez, get a room!
",234535,Gary," Maybe later.
",144536,Fry," Hey, I have an idea: Let's all go out for ice cream.
",544537,Gary," Actually, I thought Amy might like to come back to my place for coffee.
",734538,Amy," I don't really like coffee.
",294539,Gary," Neither do I.
",154540,Amy," Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!
",294541,Gary," Let me pick up the check.
",274542,Fry," Nooo!  That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here.  Ooh! Ow!
",614543,Leela," Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body: Fry.
",564544,Fry," Oh, Leela!
",124545,Amy," We were just on our way out.
",304546,Leela," Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?
",714547,Gary," I'm a banking industry regulator.
",354548,Leela," Really? Y'know, I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple.
",834549,Gary," Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern banking regulations are a product of five different regulatory traditions. Six if you wanna get technical.
",1494550,Leela," Oh, I do.
",114551,Gary," It all began in 1410 when a number of noblemen convened...
",604552,Fry,"  Thank you.
",134553,Zoidberg," There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin. I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash.
",1044554,Fry," Can I live without it?
",244555,Zoidberg," If you call that living.
",264556,Farnsworth," I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your chest. To crush those who disobey you.  But I guess we're just two different people.
",1664557,Fry," So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff.
",1004558,Amy," It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel lonely I can just look over at this disfiguring scar and think of you.
",1114559,Fry," Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back.
",514560,Leela," So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?
",514561,Fry," Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender.  Ow! Cool!  Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night.
",1124562,Leela," Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.
",514563,Bender," Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender.
",614564,Leela," Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.
",1074565,Bender," Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?
",284566,Leela," No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!
",974567,Bender," True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?
",764568,Leela," Yeah.
",74569,Fry," I guess so.  Watch the neck! Watch the neck!
",464570,Bender," My ass! My beautiful ass!
",274571,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. I've taught the toaster to feel love.  And Hermes returns from his vacation today.
",1054572,Hermes,"  Good morning, people.
",244573,Fry," Hey, Hermes!
",144574,Zoidberg," Hello!
",84575,Leela," Good to see you.
",184576,Farnsworth," Yo!
",54577,Bender," My man!
",94578,Amy," So how was the Spleef Nebula?
",314579,Hermes,"  The flight had a stopover on the Brain Slug Planet. Hermes liked it so much he decided to stay of his own free will.
",1194580,Fry," Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!
",754581,Leela,"  Shh! You're gonna get us all assimilated!
",444582,Amy,"  Just act normal and switch to a garlic shampoo.
",504583,Hermes,"  On to new business. Today's mission is for all of you to go to the Brain Slug Planet.
",884584,Zoidberg," What are we going to do there?
",324585,Hermes,"  Just walk around not wearing a helmet.
",414586,Farnsworth," Sounds great, Hermes! Whatever you say.   Let's ditch him and go to the movies!
",814587,Fry," Hey, yeah!
",124588,Zoidberg," I'm seeing a movie with friends!
",344589,Fry," Cool! Let's see this one!
",274590,Leela," Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good things about Quizblorg, Quizblorg.
",1074591,Amy," Guk! I hate subtitles. Alien films are so pretentious.
",564592,Zoidberg," Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams.  It's about an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam.
",1404593,Bender," Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits: The Movie.
",614594,Fry," Yeah, I wanna see that.
",254595,Bender," Good point, Bender.
",214596,Fry," I'll take a small Slurm.
",264597,Refreshment-bot," For only 25 cents less, you can get a super-small.
",524598,Fry," Uh, OK.  Oh, man!
",194599,Bender," Hey, gimme a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil.
",734600,Farnsworth," Down in front!
",164601,Announcer #1,"  Glagnar's Human Rinds presents: This Week In The Universe.
",614602,Fry,"  Ooh, this is real futuristic!
",324603,Crow T. Robot #1," Shh! Don't talk during the movie.
",354604,Announcer #1,"  This week in the universe: New New York mayor C. Randall Poopenmeyer opens a new tube line to alleviate rush hour traffic.  Dateline: Paramecium Homeworld. Newly-crowned Miss Universe Gladice Lennox entertains troops fighting to wipe out the human race.  Go get 'em, boys!  And in the world of Ultimate Robot Fighting, the Masked Unit wins his championship bout against Gorgeous Gonks by technical melting.
",4094605,Bender,"  Go, Masked Unit!  Uh, hey, buddy! Yo!  You mind taking your head off?
",724606,Robot #1," I'm sorry, sir, but I need it to watch the movie.
",514607,Bender," Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.
",564608,Robot #1," Sir, she is as the factory made her.
",384609,Bender," Well they should have stopped making her about halfway through.
",654610,Fembot #1,"  Whee!
",84611,Calculon,"  Well, that finishes this paperwork.  Calculon Enterprises.
",614612,Monique,"  Calculon, a fight scene has broken out at the special effects warehouse. Come quickly before a fiery explosion chases someone down a hallway.
",1444613,Calculon,"  I have no choice but to--
",284614,Mr. Moviefone,"  If you want Calculon to race to the laser gun battle in his hover-Ferarri, press 1. If you want Calculon to double-check his paperwork, press 2. Enter now.
",1584615,Mr. Moviefone," You have pressed 2.
",214616,Fry," No, I didn't!
",154617,Mr. Moviefone," I'm almost positive you did.
",304618,Calculon,"  Add in the carryover from form 16A, then deduct line 2B...
",614619,Robot #1," Pardon me, sir, but you seem to be inadvertently kicking my seat.
",674620,Bender,"  ""Pardon me, sir, but you seem to be bleh, bleh...""
",534621,Robot #1," Yes, that's the gist of what I said. Would you mind?
",544622,Bender," Sure thing, pal.
",184623,Robot #1," Uh, sir?
",104624,Bender,"  Who threw that?
",184625,Robot #1," That's it! Sir, I challenge you to fisticuffs!
",484626,Bender," Oh, I'm boned.
",164627,Hattie McDoogal," Let's all go to the lobby!
",284628,Robot #1," I'm gonna open a file of whup-ass on you!
",434629,Leela," Bender, do you know who that was?
",354630,Man #1," Cripes! The Masked Unit! You knocked him out cold.
",524631,Man #1 #2," I'm impressed.
",164632,Doubledeal," Son, I'm the commissioner of Ultimate Robot Fighting. I'm a connoisseur of jerks like you who pick fights in movie theatres and you're the biggest I've ever seen.
",1644633,Bender," You should see me at funerals.
",324634,Doubledeal," Kid, I want you in the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
",564635,Bender," Ultimate Robot Fighting? Sounds pleasant! I'll do it.
",554636,Flabby," My hero!
",104637,Farnsworth," Aw. They don't make movies like this anymore.
",474638,Bender," I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine!
",1214639,Amy," Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal form of competition in the galaxy!
",1054640,Bender," It is?
",84641,Farnsworth," There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner.
",1244642,Bender," Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
",344643,Farnsworth," Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely.
",944644,Bender," Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.
",734645,Leela," No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is.
",594646,Fry," Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?
",764647,Leela," This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about pride. Let me tell you a story from my childhood.
",1234648,Zoidberg," Oh, again with the orphanarium!
",334649,Leela," When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot.
",664650,Leela,"  My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu.
",394651,Fnog," Excellent. Bill, Keith, you will go to Junior Championships. Bill, congratulate Keith when he regains consciousness.
",1184652,Leela," But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed.
",634653,Fnog," Perhaps. But there is more to winning than beating your opponent. You lack the will of the warrior.
",1014654,Leela," What do you mean? Watch this!
",314655,Bill,"  Ow!
",64656,Fnog," No girl has the will of a warrior. You have the will of a housewife or, at best, the schoolmarm.
",984657,Leela," That's it. I'll take you on right now.
",404658,Fnog," Very well. But, you see, I have the will of the warrior. Therefore, the battle is already over. The winner? Me!  Rematch? You lose again! Had enough? I thought so!
",1654659,Leela," I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours.
",704660,Bender," Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back in!
",734661,Leela," Let's see what you got. Touch your toes.
",424662,Bender," Still ... can't ... reach!
",284663,Bender," Let's commence preparations for rumbling!
",434664,Referee," Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars, welcome to tonight's main event. In this corner, from Mom's Friendly Robot Factory in America's heartland, Mexico: Bender!  And in this corner, from and made of Parts Unknown: The Clearcutter!
",2294665,Fry,"  Bender rules!
",164666,Hermes,"  I got you an official Bender hat.
",364667,Fry," Wow! Thanks, Hermes!  I-- Hey! Cut that out!
",464668,Bender," You can't hit what you can't see!
",354669,Leela," Get up, Bender. You can't quit every time you get an axe in the back.  Or a drill through your face. Now quit scratching your axe-hole and get out there.
",1554670,Bender," Huh?
",64671,Referee," And the winner is ... Bender!
",314672,Doubledeal," Nice work out there, kid.
",274673,Bender," Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!
",524674,Clearcutter," Hi, boss. Yo, dude!
",214675,Bender," Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?
",424676,Doubledeal," What, you didn't read the pamphlet? Ultimate Robot Fighting's a scam, kid. It's rigged.  It's a secret, so keep it under your head, but the most popular robot always wins.
",1734677,Bender," You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?
",664678,Doubledeal," Bingo!
",84679,Bender," Woo-hoo! I'm popular!
",234680,Doubledeal," In fact, you're more than popular, you're pure lowest common denominator.
",754681,Bender," Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
",344682,Referee," Presenting Bender the Offender!
",334683,Bender," I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back.
",644684,Referee," Versus ... Billionairebot!
",284685,Referee," Versus: The Foreigner!
",244686,Foreigner," I'm not from here! I have my own customs! Look at my crazy passport!
",704687,Referee," Versus ... The Chain Smoker!
",304688,Chain Smoker," I love smoking. And after I win the fight I'm heading straight to your favourite restaurant.
",944689,Bender," You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover.
",454690,Leela," Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both of us worked so hard.
",1064691,Bender," What do you mean, ""we""?
",254692,Leela," I said ""us"".
",144693,Bender," Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody!
",864694,Fembot #1 #1," What about us, Mr. The Offender?
",344695,Bender," Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!
",454696,Bender," Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud?
",874697,Doubledeal," Actually, we've decided to go in a different direction.
",574698,Bender," What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?
",724699,Doubledeal," Bender, your popularity is slipping.
",384700,Foreigner," Sales of your Bender Brand French milk bath soaps are down 20%.
",654701,Bender," Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!
",494702,Doubledeal," Damnit, Bender! If you can't move sandalwood, you don't belong in this league! That's why you're gonna lose next week's title match.
",1344703,Bender," But the crowd loves me.
",254704,Doubledeal," Perhaps. But let's see how they feel about your new persona: The Gender Bender.
",814705,Billionairebot," You'll be the most unpopular robot fighter since Sergeant Faeces Processor.
",774706,Bender," Oh, yeah?  Well what if I don't let the new guy win?
",544707,Doubledeal," Then he'll just have to beat you the old-fashioned way: To death!  Melissa, send in the new kid.
",984708,Destructor," I am Destructor!
",184709,Bender,"  See you at the fight.
",244710,Bender," So then I said, ""See you at the fight."" And that's the story.
",634711,Fry," Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing.
",1124712,Bender," It's one thing to win a fixed fight; there's dignity in that. But to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win.
",1474713,Leela," No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should I give it to you now when you do need it?
",1164714,Farnsworth," What the hell are you talking about?
",384715,Leela," I don't know. But I'm not helping.
",364716,Announcer #1,"  You loved him as Bender the Offender! Now get ready to hate him as he threatens your sexuality in his new persona ... The Gender Bender!
",1394717,Bender,"  I'm a real toughie!
",224718,Announcer #1,"  Squaring off this Sunday versus Destructor!
",464719,Destructor,"  I will destroy you!  And stop calling me!
",444720,Fnog,"  I am Destructor's trainer, Master Fnog. My pupil will be victorious for he has the will of a warrior!
",1044721,Leela," Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like a girl!
",804722,Bender,"  I'll put on my tutu!
",234723,Cosell," Hello and welcome to a remarkable championship bout. Destructor, a robotic armoured tank, whose very use at battle has been ruled a war crime, versus Gender Bender, who wears a pink tutu.  This is Rich Little, imitating Howard Cosell, here at ringside with George Foreman. George, a word in edgewise?
",3024724,Foreman," This could be the most one-sided fight since 1973 when Ali faced an 80-foot tall mechanical Joe Frazier. M-My memory's not what it used to be but I think the entire Earth was destroyed.
",1874725,Little," Interesting, if true. The Vegas odds tonight stand at an unprecedented 1000-0; a bet of $0 on Bender pays $1000 if he wins. Still, very few takers.
",1494726,Foreman," It's not-not a smart bet.
",274727,Leela," According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!
",1504728,Bender," Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!
",404729,Hermes," Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!
",394730,Bender," Sorry, buddy. Here you go!
",284731,Hermes,"  Thank you. It was cold down there on the floor.
",504732,Amy," Here, Professor, I got you a programme.
",414733,Farnsworth," Oh, good. Just let me put on my reading glasses.  Why, Zoidberg, there's a lovely photo of you in here.
",1054734,Referee," In this corner, the confused young robot with the golden curls. Weighing 525lbs: The Gender Bender!
",1014735,Zapp," Boo!
",64736,Nixon,"  Get that hippie out of the ring!
",354737,Referee," And in these two corners, weighing 400 tons, the gizmo from Pismo ... Beach, Destructor!
",904738,Fnog," So, we meet again. Most amusing: Girl who acts like fighter training fighter who acts like girl.
",984739,Leela," Keep laughing, Fnog!  Ready, Bender?
",384740,Bender," I was born ready! Gimme the bell!  Did you hear a noise?  Final boarding call for flight 406, non-stop service to pain.  Now boarding standby passengers--
",1564741,Foreman," This seems like as good a time as any time to bring up my new grill for no reason.  With its patented design, the fat drains directly into my mouth.
",1504742,Bender,"  Fry! Throw in the towel!  For God's sakes, Fry!
",504743,Hermes,"  That's exactly what I was thinking.
",384744,Bender,"  Mommy!
",94745,Leela," OK, Fnog, that's enough. Call him off. Fnog?  Hmm.
",524746,Bender," Why won't anyone help me?
",274747,Leela," So, once more we meet again.
",304748,Fnog," Huh?
",64749,Leela," You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet. I mean, cheating in a fake fight. That's low!
",1194750,Fnog," Better than being a girl. Like you. You're a girl!
",524751,Leela,"  Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!
",494752,Bender," Huh? It's bendering time!  Take this. And this!
",494753,Fnog," You were an excellent student.  Too bad I was a lousy teacher!
",644754,Bender," I think you misunderstood the concept of ""bendering time""!
",604755,Fnog," See you in girl hell. I'll be in boy hell -- much nicer!
",584756,Leela," Yes!
",64757,Bender," Yes!  Oh!
",114758,Referee," And the winner is Destructor!
",314759,Little," I've not seen a spectacle of this nature in all my years impersonating a sportscaster.
",884760,Foreman," It sure was some fight. Interesting side note: As a head without a body, I envy the dead.
",914761,Little," No argument here.
",194762,Fry," Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!
",634763,Amy," Fry, where's your Brain Slug?
",314764,Farnsworth," Poor little guy starved to death.
",354765,Leela," I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school.
",1394766,Bender," I'm in tremendous pain here.
",304767,Doubledeal," Great job, kid. You lost and you made it look almost half real. I want you to have this card good for 10% off at Bed Bath & Beyond.
",1334768,Bender," Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!
",384769,Little," And so ends the chronicle of one of the greatest ever to play the sport.
",744770,Foreman," And he didn't look half bad in the tutu.
",424771,Little," That he did surely not.
",254772,Foreman," What?
",74773,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Several years ago I tried to log on to AOL, and it just went through. Whee! We're online!
",1124774,Farnsworth," Go ahead, get into these net suits. I designed and tested them myself.
",724775,Leela," They smell like burning Rhesus Monkey.
",404776,Farnsworth," Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go.
",784777,Fry," Hey!
",64778,Bender," Behold: The Internet!
",234779,Fry," My God! It's full of ads!
",274780,Leela," Follow me!
",124781,Fry," It's immense.
",154782,Leela," It's got every piece of information anyone could ever want.
",614783,Fry," So I see!
",114784,Zoidberg," What? What's going on here?
",294785,Amy," Hey, that's me!
",174786,Bender," No, it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body.
",934787,Leela," Hey!
",64788,Doorman," Are you over 18?
",184789,Young Boy," Yes.
",64790,Younger Boy," Yes.
",64791,Bender," I'm telling you, Fry, they've got a chatroom for everybody. And here it is.
",774792,Amy," Ew, that is so gross!
",234793,Leela," Yeah. I'll stick with this one, thank you.
",444794,Amy," Yeah.
",74795,Bender,"  Hi, I'm a naughty nurse and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.
",804796,Man #1," Ooh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.
",434797,Bender," So how 'bout them Knicks?
",274798,Nerd #1 #1," Hello? Are there any girls in this room at all?
",494799,Nerd #1 #2," Yeah, bring on the hot chicks 'cause I'm a hot stud.
",544800,Nerd #1 #3," Yeah! So are we!
",184801,Leela," I'm a woman, if that's what you mean.  I don't like to play games, so I'll just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested in meeting a man.
",1934802,Nerd #1 #4," A woman! I'm scared.
",224803,Fry," Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?
",1174804,Bender,"  Is the Space Pope reptilian?
",314805,Hermes," Get ready for fun, Fry. Nowadays, we have a type of game played entirely on video.
",844806,Leela," We call it a ""video game"".
",284807,Fry,"  Uh, ""video game"" you say? Well, golly gee, you mighty spacemen of the future will have to show me how it works.
",1144808,Zoidberg," The doctor is in!  The doctor is out!
",394809,Holo-Farnsworth," Everyone, please sign off. We have a delivery. Plus I have to use the phone--  Leela, please tell the others that--
",1174810,Leela," Who are you?
",144811,Cyclops," I saw you in the chat room but you left before I had a chance to talk to you. After all these years of searching for another Cyclops.
",1354812,Leela," I can't believe it. I've dreamed of this moment all my life.
",624813,Cyclops," Do you think perhaps you and I--
",344814,Leela," Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am!
",2214815,Fry," Oh, Leela, I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do--  Gotcha!  I won! I'm the greatest!
",1004816,Leela," Come on. We have work to do.
",304817,Fry," Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once-in-a-lifetime chance to learn the meaning of your existence?
",1094818,Leela," No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now let's concentrate on getting this desperately-needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14, OK?
",1544819,Operator,"  Leela, you've got mail!  It's not spam.
",424820,Leela," Huh?  It's him!
",174821,Cyclops,"  To Leela. Subject: Hello. I am Alcazar. Fortunately I wrote down your screenname before I was dispatched by that oafish moron.
",1294822,Fry," Kicked your ass!
",184823,Alcazar,"  Leela, we have much to discuss. Please come join me on the planet of your birth. Co-ordinates follow.
",1044824,Fry," Well, too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery.
",594825,Leela," It'll get there.
",184826,Leela," After a whole life of searching, I may finally have found where I belong.
",754827,Bender," Too bad it's a dump.
",224828,Leela," Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.
",454829,Fry," Lazy sculptor!
",164830,Alcazar," Welcome home, Leela.
",224831,Leela," Alcazar?  Are you real? Or am I seeing single?
",484832,Alcazar," Ow! Of course I'm real.
",254833,Leela," After all this time, somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter or, uh, a kid with a BB gun.
",1074834,Alcazar," It's alright, Leela. You'll never be alone again.  Come, let me introduce you to yourself. Do you mind if your servants walk?
",1274835,Leela," Not at all!
",134836,Alcazar," We are the last remaining Cyclopses. Our planet is Cyclopia. This is the capital, Cyclops City. Stop me if I'm going too fast for you.
",1364837,Leela," There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already.
",814838,Alcazar," This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess of beauty.
",514839,Fry," Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?
",554840,Alcazar," Her perfect eye reminds me of yours, Leela. Had our race survived, you would have been a temple priestess or a supermodel.
",1244841,Leela," Oh, please! Really?
",214842,Alcazar," And there's the infamous pirate, Purple Beard, scourge of the six seas.
",734843,Fry," What's over that hill?
",244844,Alcazar," The Forbidden Valley. A holy sanctuary where no one may tread.
",644845,Fry," Is that anything like a cemetery 'cause I gotta take a leak.  Ow!
",674846,Leela," Fry, that's offensive to our people.  Isn't it?
",494847,Fry," Ow!
",54848,Alcazar," This is my home. I hope you don't think less of me because I live in a giant castle.
",864849,Leela," Oh, no, not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed.
",544850,Bender," Ooh! I'm gonna need to make some room.
",404851,Alcazar," In here is where I dream my lonely dreams and cook my simple meals.
",694852,Leela," It's all so sad. What happened to our people?
",474853,Alcazar," It's too painful to speak of now. Come, I'll show you your quarters.
",704854,Bender," Ow! Ow! Ow!
",134855,Leela," I heard you from my room. What's wrong?
",414856,Alcazar," Nothing. It's just-- No, Leela. I don't want to see tears in your perfect eye.
",804857,Leela," Please, is it about the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested in that.
",824858,Alcazar," Well, OK. But it's chilly and you're going to be all wet from the tears. Let's go into my chamber.
",1004859,Alcazar,"  It wasn't long ago. Our people were happy and prosperous ...  ... but the eyeless mole people of Subterra 3 grew jealous of our visual prowess. They fired missile in all directions hoping to hit Cyclopia.  Unfortunately, one of the 40 planets hit, was ours.
",2604860,Cyclopian Man #1," How far away do you think it is?
",344861,Cyclopian Man #1 #2," A trillion miles?
",194862,Alcazar," Things got hot. You look a little hot, actually. You can take off that jacket.  Our people don't like to be hot. Anyway, just before the impact...
",1484863,Alcazar,"  Our smartest scientists managed to save one baby.
",524864,Leela," Alcazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!
",544865,Alcazar,"  Fortunately, I was employed as a pool cleaner at the time and, when I emerged from retrieving a dead possum, I found I was the only one left.
",1444866,Leela," It's so tragic.
",174867,Alcazar," Yes, but the real tragedy is that our race ends with us.
",584868,Leela," It doesn't have to.
",214869,Alcazar," What do you mean?
",194870,Leela," You're a male and I'm a female.
",334871,Alcazar," I'm still not following you.
",304872,Leela," Wake up, my king.
",194873,Alcazar," Oh, jeez, what a night. Make me some coffee, would you.
",574874,Leela," Uh, sure, OK. What do you take with that?
",434875,Alcazar," Pancakes and sausage. Kitchen's in the basement, pans are in the attic.
",734876,Leela," Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.
",704877,Fry," Mmm! Great pancakes, Leela.
",294878,Alcazar," Yeah, they'll come in handy if I need to cover any tiny manholes.  Listen, hon', we don't want to look like slobs in front of the other species, do we?
",1534879,Leela," No.
",54880,Alcazar," So get to work on these dishes. And then organise my collection of naked celebrity photos by name and what you can see.
",1214881,Leela," Look, Alcazar--
",174882,Alcazar," Call me Al.
",134883,Leela," Look, Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise, but I'm not your maid.
",1004884,Alcazar," You're right, I'm sorry. I guess the relationship isn't going to work. So much for the Cyclops race. I thought it was a pretty good race but, uh--
",1484885,Leela," OK, OK, I'll do the dishes.  Hey, where'd they go?
",524886,Bender," Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel: Worshipping some low-life jerk.
",934887,Fry," He may be some low-life jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is.
",1184888,Fry," Try and stop me!
",184889,Leela," Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it.  Who are these people?
",654890,Alcazar," Friends.
",104891,Leela," Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?
",694892,Alcazar," They were giving it away on the street corner. Just like you, Leela!
",704893,Leela," Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need: Mouthwash, a back wax and stain-proof underwear.
",1194894,Rat Woman #1," You go, girl!
",154895,Alcazar," By the way, your pal Fry fell into the dungeon. Take him a taco so he doesn't die and stink up the place.
",1074896,Leela," Come on, Al, can't you let the little guy out?
",484897,Alcazar," Jeez, Leela, twice in one day? I'm not Superman!
",504898,Leela," Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?
",584899,Fry," 'Cause I think Alcazar's hiding something from you. Listen, Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alcazar's a jerk. He's bad for you. He--
",1844900,Leela," I know.
",94901,Fry," You do?
",94902,Leela," Fry, if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious to me. He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave.
",1464903,Fry," Then dump his one-eyed ass.
",294904,Leela," I can't. If I leave Alcazar, that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't let that happen. Even if it means a lifetime of unhappiness.
",1394905,Alcazar,"  Leela! Mop up in aisle number two!
",374906,Leela," I'll break up with him at dinner.
",354907,Fry," I'll be there.
",164908,Alcazar," Yo, Leela, what gives? Pig says your slop tastes like crap.
",614909,Pig," Yeah. Like crap.
",184910,Fry," C'mon, Leela, you deserve better than this guy. Dump him already!
",674911,Leela," I'm trying.
",134912,Alcazar," Hey, everyone, jam a sock in your spit faucets.  Not long ago I spent my lonely nights renting slasher flicks with Rat Man and his girlfriend. But then a beautiful woman arrived and-- Stop eating, Pig! And she brought new hope for me and our once great civilisation. Now a million centuries of Cyclops destiny depend on the answer to one question.  Leela, will you marry me?
",3764913,Fry,"  No! No!
",104914,Leela," Yes! I will!
",144915,Rat Woman #1," They're getting married!
",264916,Amy," Congratulations, Leela!
",254917,Zoidberg," Hello.
",84918,Hermes," Oh, this is great!
",204919,Leela,"  Glad you could make it.
",264920,Bender,"  It's a magical day.
",224921,Fry,"  Welcome!
",114922,Fry," Psst, Leela. You've gotta get me out of here. It's horrible! Eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo.
",1444923,Leela," Animals go in the corner.
",274924,Fry," The corner! Why didn't I think of that?
",414925,Leela," Look, Fry, I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy.  Here. Try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be.
",1434926,Fry," That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.
",454927,Fry," Bender, come on. We've gotta get some dirt on Alcazar. Let's go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.
",1244928,Bender," Uh, no, thanks. I'm good.
",274929,Fry," But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.
",634930,Bender," I don't know, Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough.
",824931,Fry," Bender, snap out of it!
",254932,Bender," Sorry, I don't know what came over me. Let's go.   I love stealing, I love taking things!
",914933,Zoidberg,"  That pig over there is wearing the same sandals as me.
",574934,Fry," Come on, boy, jump!  Good boy!
",324935,Bender," Whoa, Mittens!
",164936,Fry," My God! Four identical castles!
",334937,Bender," Each more identical than the last!
",364938,Fry," That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes.
",664939,Bender," And here's another one with no eyes.
",384940,Preacherbot," Does anyone have a reason why this couple shall not be joined in the irrevocable shackles of holy bliss?
",1064941,Farnsworth," Saving a race of one-eyed monsters? Who could object to that?
",634942,Alcazar," Cut to the chase, Preach!
",274943,Preacherbot," Do you, Alcazar ...  ...  take this woman before you ... to love ... in sickness ... do you part?
",994944,Alcazar," Yeah, sure I do. Come on, faster!
",354945,Preacherbot," Do you, Leela, copy and paste his response till death do you part?
",684946,Leela," I ... d--
",114947,Amy," Oh, my God!
",134948,Alcazar," What the--?
",134949,Fry," Hey, Alcazar, you left somebody off the guest list.
",534950,Five-Eyed Woman #1," Alcazar, why you are so late for our wedding? And why you have only one eye?
",784951,Alcazar," It ... ooh, uh!  Hey, sweetie. Just go back to the castle and wait for me.  She-- She's nuts. I can morph into a five-eyed alien and I kinda said I'd marry her. But I'm really a Cyclops and I'm really going to marry you.
",2224952,Fry," Oh, yeah? Then what about this?
",334953,Alcazar," This is a bit awkward.
",244954,Five-Eyed Woman #1," Who's she?
",124955,Leela," Who's she?
",124956,Sandy," Who are they?
",154957,Alcazar," Go back to the castle, Sandy.
",314958,Fry," And maybe you'd like to meet her.  And her.
",454959,Alcazar," Leela, this must all be very confusing.
",414960,Leela," A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it.
",694961,Sandy," Show us your real form!
",254962,Leela," Yeah!
",74963,Alien #2," Do it!
",84964,Alcazar," Well, this is the real me. But I can explain: We all have needs. Mine was to make it with five weirdos and have them scrub my five castles. I gave you all what you wanted and of course I made a few bucks letting Pig watch through the two-way mirror. Can any of you say you wouldn't have done the exact same thing in my position?
",3304965,Bender,"  He's a saint!
",164966,Leela," But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?
",574967,Alcazar," Hey, lady, you got any idea what it costs to rent a tux that changes shape?
",774968,Leela," Alright, Alcazar, I just have one last question for you.
",584969,Alcazar," What's that?
",144970,Leela," If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?
",804971,Leela," Thanks for saving me from that creep, Fry.
",444972,Fry," Hey, that's what I do.
",244973,Leela," I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who I really was.
",854974,Farnsworth," No harm done. In the many decades you'll work to repay me for that shipment of popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty of time to search for your true home.
",1604975,Leela," Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?
",464976,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! The university is bringing me up on disciplinary charges. Wait, that's not good news at all.
",1154977,Leela," Whatever you did, Professor, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation.
",734978,Farnsworth," Yes, but they won't listen. Everyone's always in favour of saving Hitler's brain but when you put it in the body of a great white shark, ooh, suddenly you've gone too far.
",1734979,Vernon," Professor Farnsworth, do you know why we've called you here today?
",684980,Farnsworth," Listen to me, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me. Dean Vernon, I know the truth: It was you driving your hover-car that night, not your horse. Dean Epsilon, I know all about your ""Department of Pool Boy Studies"". And Dr. Wernstrom ... Wernstrom!
",2784981,Vernon," Actually, Professor, we merely called you here to say...  Surprise!
",694982,Man #1," Surprise!
",114983,Man #1 #2," Happy birthday!
",174984,Hermes," Surprise!
",114985,Farnsworth," And you, Coach Smalley, or should I say ""Coach hairpiece""?
",604986,Leela," No, Professor! It's a surprise party for your 150th birthday.
",634987,Farnsworth,"  Hundred and ... what?  Ooh!
",304988,Bender," Good evening, I'm--  Whoa, sorry. I'm Bender and I'll be emceeing this roast. Y'know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps. So here's the Professor's oldest friend, a grotesque, stinking lobster.
",2134989,Zoidberg," Good evening, ladies and germs.  That wasn't a joke, I was talking to Dean Streptococcus.  Now, I'm not saying Professor Farnsworth is old, but if you consider his age, he's likely to die soon.  Hey, Ringo, that was the joke. Oh, it's Showtime at the Apollo all over again.
",2754990,Bender," Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there!  But seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's delivery ship, our next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Musky?
",2254991,Zoidberg," I wouldn't wanna follow that guy!
",354992,Bender," And now, a man who needs no introduction.   Fry, get up there!
",644993,Fry," Oh.  Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Professor Farnsworth, I thought ""Why should I?"" Then later Leela made the film. But if I had made the film, you could bet there would have been a lot more topless women on motorcycles!  Roll film!
",2774994,Leela,"  Hubert J. Farnsworth was born April 9th 2851 in New New York's nerdiest slum, Hell's Laboratory. A precocious child, young Hubert learned to read while he was still in diapers -- at age 8.  And before long he blossomed into a greasy teenager.
",2454995,Fry,"  Dork alert!
",144996,Leela,"  After 14 years of graduate school, Farnsworth settled into the glamorous life of a scientist: Fast cars, trendy nightspots, beautiful women -- the Professor designed them all working out of his tiny, one-room apartment.  For 50 years he worked at Mom's Friendly Robot Company, where he created the first robot capable of qualifying for a boat loan.  And even as he nears his 150th birthday, the Professor retains the fiery passion of youth.
",4434997,Farnsworth,"  Listen, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me.
",774998,Bender," How 'bout a few words, Professor?
",354999,Farnsworth," Eh, wha?
",105000,Bender," I said ""words"".
",175001,Farnsworth," Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishment summed up in a 3-minute film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. So little time.
",1605002,Bender," Funny, funny stuff.
",215003,Farnsworth," My life is over.
",185004,Leela," No, it isn't. You have another 10 years left.
",475005,Fry," Leela! He could live another 100 years!
",415006,Leela," No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious planet and you never return.
",1205007,Fry," Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?
",495008,Bender,"  Nobody knows!
",165009,Farnsworth," So many loves half-loved, so many inventions half-invented. That damn time machine alone set me back 15 years.
",1125010,Zoidberg," If only it'd worked, you could go back and not waste your time on it.
",715011,Farnsworth," There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take care of my work and my research and my fabulous fortune.  By God, that's it! I've got to name a successor.
",1665012,Fry," A successor?
",145013,Zoidberg," A successor to the Professor?
",315014,Farnsworth," There's no time to lose. I'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming machine!
",815015,Fry," Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days.
",485016,Bender," I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor. Then I hope he did die.
",945017,Zoidberg," You? The successor? Over my empty shell! The Professor will pick me. Only I have his lobster-like tenacity.
",1095018,Hermes," Up yours, Zoidberg. Up wherever your species traditionally crams things. The only sensible way to choose a successor is with a limbo contest.
",1435019,Leela," What?
",75020,Hermes," Kingston rules. Two men go down, one come up.
",475021,Leela," Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the rest of you with his dentures.
",1085022,Amy," Yesh, he would.
",175023,Fry," Sorry, everyone, but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water.
",705024,Zoidberg,"  Blood ... thicker ... water.
",315025,Farnsworth," Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. So anyone with a weak heart should leave now. Goodbye.
",1035026,Leela," Uh, Professor?
",165027,Farnsworth," Oh, oh, yes, the announcement! As you all know, I am not long for this world.
",795028,Leela," Yes, we know.
",155029,Hermes," True, mon.
",125030,Amy," Buh!
",65031,Fry," One foot in the grave.
",245032,Farnsworth," So I've picked my successor. It's someone in whom I have great faith -- even though his mind is undeveloped and he's accomplished nothing.  My closest living relative.
",1695033,Fry," Oh, yeah!
",115034,Farnsworth," My clone, Cubert Farnsworth.
",305035,Zoidberg," He's horrible!
",165036,Fry," Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?
",535037,Amy," You wish!
",115038,Fry," Where did Cubert come from?
",295039,Farnsworth," 12 years ago I began the cloning process by removing some skin cells from one of the shapelier growths on my back.
",1165040,Leela," Wait. If he's your clone, why doesn't his nose look like yours?
",655041,Farnsworth," I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished up against the side.
",805042,Bender," Is he dumb or just ugly?
",265043,Farnsworth," Let's find out.
",175044,Cubert," What? You've never seen a genius's wiener before?
",515045,Zoidberg," No.
",55046,Leela," Never.
",85047,Fry," Well, once in the park.
",255048,Zoidberg," Mmm!
",65049,Cubert," As long as I'm going to be in charge here, let me examine my so-called ""crew"", if it can so be called. First of all, Dr. Zoidberg, do you even have a medical degree?
",1675050,Zoidberg," I lost it ... in a volcano.
",295051,Cubert," And why do we need a bending robot around here anyway? What possible use do we have for you?
",945052,Bender," Uh ... me no speaka the English.
",345053,Cubert," And why does our space pilot have only one eye? There's someone I'd like you to meet. His name is depth perception!
",1175054,Leela," Why, you little--
",195055,Cubert," Wow, that hurt -- the air!
",285056,Bender," Im pending para un bending!
",295057,Farnsworth," Oh, Cubert, come in here. I have something amazing to show you.
",655058,Cubert," What is it? A competent employee? I doubt that very much!
",595059,Fry," Little twerp.
",155060,Bender," Aye, Chihuahua!
",175061,Farnsworth," As my successor, I'm trusting you to carry on my work. These are just some of the half-finished inventions you'll spend your life finishing.
",1425062,Cubert," I didn't realise you were the inventor of the junk heap.
",585063,Farnsworth," That's my prize-winning Smellescope. If a dog craps anywhere in the universe, you can bet I won't be out of the loop.  And this is my universal translator. Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language.
",2375064,Cubert," Hello.
",85065,Universal Translator," Bonjour!
",105066,Farnsworth," Crazy gibberish!
",185067,Cubert," Don't you have any worthwhile inventions?
",435068,Farnsworth," Why, certainly. Step over here.
",335069,Farnsworth," These are the dark matter engines I invented. They allow my starship to travel between galaxies in mere hours.
",1125070,Cubert," That's impossible. You can't go faster than the speed of light.
",655071,Farnsworth," Of course not. That's why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.
",765072,Cubert," Also impossible.
",185073,Farnsworth," And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner which delivers 200% fuel efficiency.
",1005074,Cubert," That's especially impossible.
",315075,Farnsworth," Not at all. It's very simple.
",315076,Cubert," Then explain it.
",185077,Farnsworth," Now that's impossible. It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another dream.
",835078,Cubert," Your explanations are pure weapons-grade bolog-nium. It's all impossible.
",755079,Farnsworth," Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being is a scientist is all about.
",985080,Cubert," No, that's what being a magical elf is all about.
",515081,Bender," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh, kill me now, people!
",755082,Elzar," How we doing here?
",205083,Bender," Oh, Elzar, everything's so good!
",345084,Elzar," What are you, an ass-kissing machine?
",395085,Bender," Yes, sir! Good one, sir!
",265086,Farnsworth," Oh, it's a gem of an evening. I feel so wonderful having someone to take over my life's work. And it's all thanks to Cubert.
",1265087,Cubert," Look, Professor, I may be identical to you in every possible way but that doesn't mean I'm anything like you.
",1115088,Farnsworth," You ... wha?
",145089,Cubert," I don't wanna be an inventor. I wanna be something useful like a teacher's aide or a prison guard or a science-fiction cartoon writer.
",1365090,Farnsworth," But-But what about my hopes and my dreams and my wonderful inventions?
",725091,Cubert," In your entire life your only half-decent invention was me and I didn't turn out like you wanted either.
",1065092,Elzar," You folks still doing alright?
",325093,Bender," Oh, yes, Elzar.
",175094,Elzar," Good, 'cause it turns out I forgot to cook that chicken.
",585095,Farnsworth," Bad news, everyone. By the time you watch this tape, I'll be gone, leaving behind me nothing but a history of failure and my original hip-bones. You see, I've been lying about my age; I'm not actually 150, I'm 160. Oh, vanity, thy name is Professor Farnsworth. And now that I have nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away.
",3575096,Farnsworth," Goodbye, cruel world.  Goodbye, cruel lamp.  Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin ...  ... and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords, cruel though they may be a--
",2235097,Farnsworth,"  And now that I've nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away.
",955098,Amy," What?
",75099,Hermes," Oh, no!
",95100,Zoidberg," Oh.
",55101,Farnsworth,"  I know you're all very upset, especially Bender.
",515102,Bender," Well, life goes on. Except for you!
",375103,Farnsworth,"  I'm sure that Bender has just made a cutting remark, but he doesn't know I taped over his soap operas to record this message.
",1285104,Bender," You bastard!
",145105,Fry," We've gotta get him back.
",275106,Cubert," Impossible! No one knows where they take those old geezers.
",615107,Fry," Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like I do.
",915108,Cubert," You're his uncle, dummy. He takes after you.
",465109,Fry," Uh ... what?
",145110,Cubert," Wait a second. That means I also take after you!
",505111,Leela," Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor.
",505112,Bender," Lay it on us, big boots.
",265113,Leela," If the Smellescope can pick up the Professor's odour, we may have a chance to save him.
",895114,Cubert," I think not. As you probably already don't know, odours are made up of particles that can't travel through the vacuum of space.
",1295115,Leela," I'm zeroing in on him.  BENGAY ... mothballs ...  ... letters to the editor. It's the Professor!
",985116,Bender," To the flying machine!
",245117,Fry," To the left!  No, to the up!  U-turn! U-turn!
",475118,Cubert," We'll never find this place. Robots are very good at keeping secrets.
",715119,Bender," No, we're not, you little bed-wetter. Oops! I'm sorry.
",565120,Leela," There it is! The Near-Death Star!
",355121,Leela," OK, we'll tell them the Professor escaped and we're bringing him back. Fry, you'll have to dress up like a 160-year-old man.
",1265122,Fry," I'm on it!
",125123,Cubert,"  My God, the illusion is so perfect I almost forgot I was looking at an idiot!
",805124,Leela," Now, they may ask for a DNA sample.
",375125,Fry," I'd like to see them find it!
",315126,Cubert," This plan is impossible. We don't even have a sample of the Professor's DNA.
",785127,Bender," I think I know where to get some.
",355128,Cubert," Why do I have to be the hump?
",315129,Fry," 'Cause you're too ugly to be a wart.
",385130,Leela," Your Medicare dollars at work.
",325131,Barrierbot #1," Halt! Identify this guest.
",285132,Leela," Uh, this is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. He escaped.
",545133,Barrierbot #1," Escaped? No one escapes.
",265134,Barrierbot #2," This guest does not look 160.
",315135,Fry," What? I'm old. Listen:  Hey, you kids, get off the lawn!
",585136,Barrierbot #1," Hmm, it is true old people are often concerned that there are children on their lawns.
",885137,Barrierbot #2," There's no denying that. But we'll still need to verify his identity with a DNA sample.
",895138,Bender," Got a hot, steaming batch right here!
",395139,Barrierbot #2," We only needed one cell!
",265140,Bender," Eh, keep the change, buddy.
",295141,Cubert," Stupid robot.
",155142,Barrierbot #1," Did your hump just say something?
",355143,Fry," Uh ... I-I've got talking hump syndrome.
",425144,Barrierbot #1," Ah, T.H.S.
",125145,Barrierbot #2," Identity confirmed. Return this shambling shuffle-boarder to his room.
",725146,Barrierbot #1," 7152 Maple Drive.
",195147,Leela," Sounds nice.
",145148,Barrierbot #1," Prepare to be surprised.
",265149,Fry," So this is where they stick old people. It's horrific!
",565150,Leela," At least it keeps them from driving.
",385151,Leela," Brace yourself for the worst.
",315152,Bender," And yet he looks so natural.
",305153,Cubert," What's happening?
",195154,Leela," He's hooked up to a life-support system.  We have to disconnect him very, very carefully, or the shock could kill him.
",1205155,Guard #1bot #1," Freeze!  Seize them!
",225156,Guard #1bot #2," Seize them!
",135157,Guard #1bot #3," Seize them!
",135158,Guard #1bot #4," Seize them!
",135159,Guard #1bot #1," Get them-- I mean seize them!
",315160,Guard #1bot #2," Aww, I'm so bad at this!
",265161,Guard #1bot #3," Uh-oh!
",85162,Leela," We're probably gonna make it, but we might not.
",495163,Cubert," It's impossible! We'll never fit.
",355164,Fry," Will too!
",115165,Cubert," Told you.
",115166,Fry," Come on, Leela! Step your big boot down on the gas pedal.
",595167,Leela," They've blown out one of our engines!
",395168,Fry,"  Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!
",745169,Leela," Only the Professor knows how to fix it. We have to wake him up.
",655170,Fry," Try shocking him.
",195171,Bender,"  Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than it used to! Young people use curse words!
",1035172,Fry," Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine ourself.
",475173,Leela," We can't, you bastard! No one knows how it works. It's impossible!
",685174,Cubert," Nothing is impossible. I understand how the engines work now. It came to me in a dream.  The engines don't move the ship at all. The ship stays where it is and the engines move the universe around it.
",2025175,Bender," That's a complete load.
",255176,Cubert," Nothing's a complete load. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being a scientist is all about. Right, Professor?  Let's ride!
",1305177,Cubert," Good news, everyone! He's made a complete recovery.
",535178,Amy," Yeah!
",75179,Hermes," Wow!
",65180,Leela," All right!
",125181,Farnsworth," I'm as spry as a 140-year-old.  See? I only broke one ankle.
",625182,Fry," So what were they doing to you in that awful drawer?
",545183,Farnsworth," Oh, they had me hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely real.
",835184,Amy," What was it like?
",195185,Farnsworth," It was as though I were living in a facility in Florida with hundreds of other old people. All day long we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call.
",1695186,Leela," It's a hundred times more horrible than anything I could imagine.
",675187,Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes. Thank you all for saving me. Especially you, my little clone. No matter what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you.
",1485188,Cubert," I've already decided. Dad, when I grow up I wanna be just like you.
",695189,Farnsworth," Don't worry, son, you will. Incidentally, you might want to read up on a condition known as ""wandering bladder"".
",1145190,Cubert," Why?
",65191,Farnsworth," No reason. No reason at all.
",305192,Hermes," Finally, the last form of the day. Welcome to Stampy Town. Population, five!  And now for the finishing touch.  Ah, the cycle of bureaucracy.  Sweet gorilla of Manila! A letter from the Central Bureaucracy!   Attention, Hermes Conrad: You are about to receive a letter from the Central Bureaucracy.  My God! It's from the Central Bureaucracy!
",3445193,Leela," I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You guys interested?
",1005194,Bender," I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
",425195,Fry," I'll play.
",125196,Bender," I'm in!
",95197,Zoidberg," Leela, Fry, robot. No matter what it is you're doing tonight, I'm available.
",785198,Leela," We're playing poker. But I'm warning you, my friends are serious players.
",755199,Zoidberg," Bah, big shots. I say let the dice do the talking.
",525200,Fry," Wow! You look happy. Is someone fired?
",405201,Hermes," Better! The Central Bureaucracy is conducting an inspection tomorrow. I will finally be promoted to grade 35, the 35th highest grade there is.
",1445202,Leela," Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch of your famous jerk dip.
",945203,Hermes," Sorry, I spent all day putting my office in order. Now I got to go home and relax the traditional Jamaican way: A glass of warm milk and good night sleep.
",1565204,Fry," Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer-space potato man.
",655205,Leela," Ah, that must be my old boss.
",315206,Ipgee," Hello, Leela. You're fired.
",295207,Leela," I know.
",95208,Ipgee," I'm sorry but it's just that you're over a year late for work at this point.
",785209,Terry,"  Let the games begin!
",235210,Ipgee," So I told Leela, ""Your request for a date is most flattering but I must decline."" These office romances never work out. After all, that is how I met my horrible wife.
",1685211,Leela," But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife.
",615212,Ipgee," And my wife doesn't know I have a job. I keep my personal and professional lives separate.
",925213,Bender," Come on, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor.
",755214,Fry," What's with the specs, Bender?
",325215,Bender," They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing eye dog was taking a whiz.
",1085216,Fry," Hey!
",65217,Zoidberg," I can't spell anything with these cards.
",425218,Zoidberg," Finally, I have a good claw. See?  Three human females, a number and a king giving himself brain surgery.
",1075219,Fry," It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak.
",785220,Bender," Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades!  Nothing, nothing, crap, crap, garbage.  Read 'em and leak salt water!
",1175221,Fry," Oh, man!
",105222,Terry," That's my baby's milk money!
",305223,Ipgee," Oh, I am broke. What will I tell my horrible wife?
",525224,Bender," If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town on your intestines.
",895225,Ipgee,"  Let me see those glasses.
",285226,Bender," Um ... uh...
",145227,Ipgee," Oh, my various Gods! X-Ray specs!
",355228,Bender," Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need 'em for reading stuff ... on the other side of stuff.
",1005229,Lou," Cheater!
",105230,Ipgee," Get him!
",105231,Terry," Break his neck!
",175232,Zoidberg," No, don't hurt him! He's my best friend!
",425233,Bender,"  Hey, you wouldn't hit a guy with X-Ray glasses would you?  Ow! Easy on the arm! Oh! Oh, my ass!
",985234,Hermes," Great cow of Moscow!
",225235,Bender," Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!
",455236,Hermes," Oh! I'll never pass inspection now. They'll bust me lower than a limbo stick ... at carnival time.   And that's as low as limbo sticks get.
",1415237,Fry," Aw, hey, c'mon, don't worry. We'll watch you clean up.
",565238,Hermes," It's too late. The inspector will be here in exactly one second.
",665239,Hermes," Who the hell are you?
",235240,Morgan," Morgan Proctor, bureaucrat grade 19.
",385241,Hermes," Hermes Conrad, bureaucrat grade 36.
",375242,Morgan," Enough friendly banter. Shall we begin the inspection?
",565243,Hermes," This way, please.
",195244,Fry,"  Jeez, Hermes, you seem awfully calm about this.
",505245,Hermes,"  Don't worry. I have a plan.
",305246,Hermes,"  I'm going to jump!
",215247,Amy,"  No!
",65248,Zoidberg,"  No!
",65249,Bender,"  Do a flip!
",135250,Leela,"  Don't do it, Hermes! You have so much to live for.
",535251,Bender,"  I get it, reverse psychology.
",325252,Farnsworth,"  Please, old friend, don't jump. Use another method that won't damage your liver. Other people need it, you know.
",1155253,Labarbara,"  Husband! Nooo!
",175254,Hermes," Outta my way, wife! I wasn't cut out to be a bureaucrat anyway. I'm only anal 78.36% of the time. I'm not worthy to stamp a form, so I'll stamp the pavement with my flabby body.
",1795255,Morgan,"  Bureaucrat Conrad, if you complete your death transaction without filing a suicide and/or falling accident permit, you will be posthumously demoted.
",1515256,Hermes," Life. Death. Either way I'm demoted to a tiny cubicle.
",565257,Hermes," Sweet something of ... of someplace.
",385258,Morgan," As your superior, I hereby relieve you of duty. Consider yourself on paid vacation.
",855259,Hermes," Oh! The ultimate penalty!
",275260,Zoidberg," I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, the sauna planet. Here, read.
",695261,Labarbara," Spa 5? Is it good?
",205262,Zoidberg," Oh, it's wonderful! I don't know anything about it but they give me a bucket of krill for every patient I send.
",1135263,Morgan," Naturally I'll have to assign a bureaucrat to fill in for Hermes while he's away. I assign me, I accept. Welcome aboard.
",1225264,Zoidberg," Then it's settled. Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat. Hurrah!
",695265,Morgan," I've been reviewing your corporate records. Regarding last Monday's delivery, why did it take twice as long as scheduled?
",1235266,Leela," Fry got his head stuck in a crater.
",375267,Fry,"  I thought it would fit.
",265268,Morgan,"  And during this period of head-crater interaction, what were you doing?
",745269,Bender," Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we ran out of olives.
",1025270,Leela," I can explain--
",175271,Morgan," You really think you can explain how you left port without a full compliment of olives? I think not.
",1025272,Leela,"  What is this, high school?
",295273,Morgan," Locker check!
",155274,Morgan," Why isn't this jacket in alphabetical order?
",465275,Leela," What?
",75276,Morgan," The zipper. It should be at the bottom.
",415277,Bender,"  Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely.
",365278,Morgan," I-- I've never seen anything like this.  Why is there yoghurt in this cap?
",765279,Fry," Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all.
",885280,Morgan," You are all dismissed. Fry, I will speak to you alone.
",565281,Fry," Uh, wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm ""Phry"" with a P-H.
",665282,Morgan,"  Admit it, Fry: You're a slob.  A dirty, filthy slob.  Dirty boy! Dirty! Dirty! Dirty!
",885283,Fry," What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.
",725284,Morgan," I'm surrounded by neat freaks everyday. There's nothing kinkier to me than a filthy slop-jock like you.
",1055285,Fry,"  Oh, stop!
",125286,Morgan," Now listen, you filthy pig. No one can know about us. If anyone asks, I'll deny it.
",855287,Fry," Just like very other girl I've dated.
",395288,Woman #1," And two and three and four and ...  ... come on, work those arms!
",675289,Labarbara,"  This is no spa, it's a forced-labour camp.
",455290,Hermes," Curse that Dr. Zoidberg! If I get out of here, he'll be looking down the business-end of a shrimp fork.
",1055291,Australian Man #1," Give him one for me too, mate. I don't know why I go to him.
",625292,Woman #1," I don't miss twice, campers!
",305293,Morgan," And for those six and a half reasons, I am demoting Leela to co-pilot.
",725294,Leela," Co-pilot? Under who?
",225295,Morgan," The autopilot.
",165296,Leela," That drunk?
",135297,Morgan," Mr. Bender, you are now in charge of co-ordinating the Professor's bodily functions.
",865298,Farnsworth," That's a full-time job.
",255299,Morgan," And Fry, as for you, I am promoting you to executive delivery boy. You will no longer go on deliveries and you will have your own office next to mine.
",1525300,Fry," Alright!
",105301,Morgan," Mr. Bender, would you high-five him so we can continue this meeting?  And on the rebound?  Meeting adjourned.
",1115302,Amy," I can't figure why she's so nice to you, Fry.
",475303,Zoidberg," She's a hateful monster, this Morgan. She scolded and hit me. I tell you, she's risking my friendship with her.
",1135304,Leela," Bender, what happened to you?
",315305,Bender," Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept coming. So I had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is, it's Morgan's fault. That pencil-pushing scazwag.  Why, if she were here, I'd-- Uh-oh, is she behind me?
",3345306,Morgan," No. I'm in front of you.
",265307,Fry," Morgan? It's 3am.
",195308,Morgan," I know. A skunk knocked over my garbage and suddenly all I could think of was you.  My God! It's so ... repulsive.  So, uh, this is where you eat?
",1485309,Fry," Eat and sleep.
",165310,Morgan," Oh, Fry!
",105311,Fry," Uh, wait, Bender's my roommate. He could be back any second.
",625312,Morgan," Not likely. I ordered him to flush out the Professor's ear wax.
",655313,Bender," Hey, Fry, I made you a candle with--  What the--?  Oh, now I see! Now I get it. Now the pieces are falling into place: The office, the promotion, that dwarf in my book club who steals my opinions.  It's all coming together now!
",2295314,Bender," I must say, this opens my eyes. Another case closed, my dear Watson.
",705315,Fry,"  Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop.
",435316,Bender," For I was blind but now I see!
",325317,Bender,"  The cat's out of the bag now!
",325318,Morgan," Mr. Bender, about last night: That was just a ... a misunderstanding.
",715319,Bender," Oh, you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You ...  ... were having sex with you.
",885320,Morgan," No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank isn't supposed to fraternise.
",685321,Bender," That's what makes it so juicy. It's the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say ""You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it,"" and they'll say ""Who, Bender? Who?"" and I'll say ""It was lovable ...  ... old Bender.""
",2365322,Fry," Hey, what did you do to him?
",305323,Morgan," I downloaded his brain. Everything that is Bender is right here. His mind, his memories, his in-your-face interface.
",1185324,Bender,"  I am Bender. Please insert girder.
",375325,Fry," But, but ... Bender need brain ... for ... smart making.  What did you do now? Stop doing things!
",995326,Morgan," I sent the disk to be filed at the Central Bureaucracy. I did what I had to do, Fry; He was a bad robot.
",1065327,Fry," No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now.
",535328,Morgan," Then you should have filed a request 20 years ago.
",525329,Fry," I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy!
",395330,Morgan," Dirty boy! Dirty boy!
",235331,Leela," You and Morgan were having an affair?
",395332,Fry," I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.
",1345333,Bender,"  I am Bender. Please insert girder.
",375334,Fry," Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!
",1345335,Amy," Yeah!
",75336,Farnsworth," Oh, yes, we must, yes.
",245337,Amy," Why?
",65338,Leela," Well, those arguments aside, we're still going.
",495339,Farnsworth," You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red tape and regulations. I've never been but a friend of mine went completely mad trying to find the washroom there.
",1925340,Leela," Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before.
",595341,Farnsworth," Oh, I've been there. Lots of times!
",375342,Hermes," Look at that: The carts go out full but they come in empty. It's criminally inefficient.
",905343,Australian Man #1,"  Quiet, mate. Pulling the empty carts is the closest thing we get to sleep.
",775344,Hermes," But don't you see? They could increase efficiency 4% if they used the empty carts to bring in heavy mining machinery.
",1195345,Man #1," Hey, I like the way you think.
",325346,Australian Man #1," Oh, Lord!
",115347,Man #1," You know, you oughta be a bureaucrat or something.
",525348,Fry," Man, how long is this gonna take?
",355349,Old Man #1," I'm still waiting on my birth certificate.
",445350,Farnsworth," Well, it doesn't look like I'll make it inside with the rest of you. Uh, but good luck. Just leave me where I drop.
",1175351,Old Man #1," Oh, great! Someone had a baby.
",325352,Leela," Come on. I have a better idea.
",325353,Leela," Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here to deliver a robot.
",915354,Bender,"  I am Bender. Please insert girder.
",375355,Grade 53 Bureaucrat," Looks like we've got a new office cut-up!
",435356,Grade 41 Bureaucrat," Look out! Look out! I'm gonna crash my slow-mobile! I had to swerve to avoid you.
",835357,Leela," While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end up?
",765358,Grade 41 Bureaucrat," Oh, you want Central Filing.
",305359,Leela," OK.
",55360,Fry," OK.
",55361,Amy," OK, thanks.
",135362,Farnsworth," Wonderful.
",125363,Grade 41 Bureaucrat,"  Nooo!
",85364,Grade 20 Bureaucrat," Central Filing? Of course I know where that is. I'm a grade 20.
",655365,Leela," Where is it?
",145366,Grade 20 Bureaucrat," I can't tell you. What do I look like? A grade 16?
",525367,Leela," We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central Filing room.  Then we'll track it using my wrist LoJack-a-mater.
",1355368,Wrist Machine," Cold. Cold. Warmer. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
",515369,Grade 11 Bureaucrat," Please don't tell my supervisor I was sleeping.
",495370,Leela," This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?
",725371,Fry," We'll never find that disk will we, Bender?
",455372,Bender,"  I am Bender. Please insert girder.
",375373,Fry," You're right. Nothing is over as long as there's one thin ray of hope.
",725374,Morgan," Lost something?  I should have known you'd come here rather than follow proper procedure. And I did know. And that's why I came here.
",1355375,Fry," Listen, Morgan, we're through. You're an evil, heartless woman and I never wanna see you again. However, would you help us get Bender back for old time's sake?
",1615376,Morgan," I'm afraid he's lost in the master in pile, and it would take some sort of giant, mechanical, atomic-powered sorting machine to find him.
",1395377,Hermes," You rang?
",115378,Farnsworth," Damnit, Hermes, just jump already. Stop hogging that healthy liver.
",695379,Hermes," No, I want to live. Organising that forced-labour spa rekindled my lifelong love of bureaucracy.
",985380,Labarbara," My Hermes got that hellhole running so efficiently that all the physical labour is now done by a single Australian man.
",1215381,Leela," But how did you know we were here?
",365382,Hermes," Dr. Zoidberg brought us.
",265383,Zoidberg," It was me! I'm the hero!
",265384,Number 1.0," Request for explanation of incident meeting?
",465385,Morgan," Number 1.0.
",135386,Hermes," Number 1.0, I hereby petition you for an emergency sort-and-file, under regulation 2 point--
",945387,Number 1.0,"  D-D-D-D-Don't quote me regulations. I co-chaired the committee that reviewed the recommendation to revise the colour of the book that regulation's in. We kept it grey.
",1705388,Hermes," Sir, please, I must located the disk with my friend's brain on it.
",685389,Number 1.0," Very well. But your bureaucratic licence will be revoked if you fail to sort the master in pile by closing time: 1pm.
",1195390,Leela," That's only four minutes from now.
",365391,Hermes," Requisition me a beat.
 When I was four there was a hurricane in Kingston Town,
With a foot and a half of water,
Everyone was alright but I cried all night,
It blew my alphabet blocks out of order,
And they said, ""This boy's born to be a bureaucrat,
Born to be all obsessive and snotty,""
I made my friends and relations file long applications,
To get into my 10th birthday party.
",3815392,Labarbara,"  But something changed when my man turned pro.
",485393,Hermes,"  I was sortin' but I wasn't smilin'.
",385394,Labarbara,"  He forgot that it's not about badges and ranks.
",505395,Hermes,"  It's supposed to be about the filing! People!
We didn't choose to be bureaucrats,
No, that's what almighty Jah made us,
We treat people like swine,
And make 'em stand in line,
Even if nobody paid us!
",2025396,Hermes,"  They say the world looks down on the bureaucrats,
They say we're anal, compulsive and weird,
But when push comes to shove,
You gotta do what you love,
Even if it's not a good idea.
Zoidberg!
",1935397,Zoidberg,"  They said I probably shouldn't be a surgeon.
",475398,Farnsworth,"  They pooh-poohed my electric frankfurter.
",445399,Leela,"  They said I probably shouldn't fly with just one eye.
",565400,Bender,"  I am Bender. Please insert girder.
",375401,Hermes,"  Everybody sing Jamaica!
",265402,All,"  Jamaica!
",115403,Hermes," Just the bureaucrats, Jamaica!
",325404,Bureaucrats,"  Jamaica!
",115405,Hermes,"  The grade 19's!
",185406,Morgan," Jamaica.
",105407,Hermes,"  Sing me home!
When push comes to shove,
You gotta do what you love,
Even if it's not a good idea!
",1005408,Bender," I'm Bender, baby! Please insert liquor!
",415409,Fry," Yeah!
",75410,Zoidberg," Congratulations.
",185411,Number 1.0," Congratulations indeed but you finished with one second to spare so I'm demoting you. A good bureaucrat never finishes early.
",1275412,Amy," That's OK, Hermes. At least we have you back.
",475413,Morgan," Not yet you don't. I'm still acting bureaucrat of Planet Express. And I have some changes to make. First, Fry, you're fired. Second--
",1355414,Hermes," Not so fast! While I was sorting I came upon a certain document filed by one Morgan Proctor. Form B: Notification of Romantic Entanglement.
",1415415,Fry," That's right, she fraternised me!
",355416,Morgan," That form isn't about you. It refers to my high school prom date. It was a regulation date that ended in regulation disappointment.
",1335417,Hermes," Yes, but you only stamped it four times!
",425418,Morgan," No! No! I was young and reckless.
",355419,Number 1.0," Bureaucrat Conrad, you are technically correct -- the best kind of correct. I hereby promote you to grade 37.  And as for you.  Guards!   Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
",2015420,Farnsworth," Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely-reduced pay, of course.
",1005421,Labarbara," It's better than nothing.
",275422,Fry," What about me? Can I come back at severely-reduced pay?
",575423,Hermes," You got it, mon! In fact, severely-reduced pay all around!  Come on, wife, let's blow this joint!
",995424,Zoidberg," Now it's time for my song!  When I was two, there was a tidal wave in--
",735425,Zoidberg,"  Aw.
",65426,Hermes," Exciting news, people! The pet licence I requisitioned for Nibbler has arrived.
",815427,Leela," Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler.
",625428,Hermes," Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the little bastard in a sack and toss the sack in a river and hurl the river into space. But I do like filling out requisitions and these were some doozies!  Great Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing licence. And it's mandatory!
",3095429,Farnsworth," Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place for fish to congregate.
",985430,Bender," So we're in international waters?
",355431,Farnsworth," Indeed so.
",125432,Bender," Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested.  Hey, guess what you're accessories to?
",1215433,Leela," The sun, the sea air, good friends.
",375434,Bender," Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?
",675435,Hermes," Why not?
",105436,Amy," Yeah.
",75437,Farnsworth," Yeah, cool.
",135438,Bender," Everybody kick in five bucks.  There, wasn't that interesting?
",645439,Leela," Bender!
",95440,Fry," This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.
",655441,Bender," Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!
",425442,Leela," I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon.
",1095443,Bender," Harpoon, my ass!
",185444,Leela," OK.
",55445,Hermes," Let's see now, which bait to use?  Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?
",685446,Zoidberg," Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm willing to offer my services as a bait critic.  These sardines for example are bland and tasteless.  And these dry, stringy night crawlers, though juicy ...  ... very, very juicy--
",2205447,Hermes," I don't believe this! It's eating my bait!  Beat it, you mooching crawdad!
",765448,Bender," Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod.
",505449,Fry,"  Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish.
",475450,Bender," Fine. I'll head over to the other side.   Good luck fishing on this side!
",755451,Fry," I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!
",505452,Bender," Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!
",315453,Fry," A shrimp?  I find it a bit hard to believe that--
",515454,Leela," Aha!  Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!
",475455,Amy," Oh, so this is where you shop for your boots?
",475456,Bender," Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!
",615457,Fry," Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's bigger than anything you've caught.  Ow! My small intestine!
",1425458,Leela," Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot.
",595459,Farnsworth," You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you need is this fish pheromone.  The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind.  Uh-oh!
",1555460,Zoidberg,"  I'm so into you!
",195461,Farnsworth," Oh, my!
",95462,Fry,"  Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!
",465463,Bender," Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this!  If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might as well not catch a big fish.  There. Like most of life's problems this one can be solved with bending.
",1855464,Farnsworth," Bender, be careful. That's the ship's diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable.
",825465,Bender," Then why do I have to be careful?
",355466,Farnsworth," It belonged to my grandmother.
",325467,Hermes," My Manwich!
",135468,Leela," Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive!  Dr. Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots?
",1165469,Zoidberg," I wasn't wearing it.  I was eating it.
",405470,Leela," Come on, let's go home.
",255471,Amy," Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! What happened to my parasol?
",705472,Bender," I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella.  What? I put sunblock on you.
",875473,Amy," Well it didn't work!
",225474,Leela," Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go.
",505475,Bender," Hey, I'm snagged.
",195476,Farnsworth," It's not snagged, the mechano man has caught something!  Sweet Zombie Jesus! It's huge!
",895477,Amy," It's coming up!
",175478,Hermes," Oh, that's big!
",175479,Farnsworth," A colossal-mouth bass!
",245480,Fry," It's diving!
",145481,Leela," It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!
",485482,Zoidberg," Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable diamond filament!  Well, at least I'll die with my friends. Hello?
",1155483,Hermes,"  My Speedos!
",145484,Leela," Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!
",625485,Farnsworth," Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure.
",535486,Fry," How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?
",475487,Farnsworth," Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one.
",665488,Bender," What's that? Is someone bending girders?
",425489,Leela," We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.
",535490,Fry," How do we do that?
",205491,Farnsworth," That should do it.
",205492,Amy," We're all gonna die!
",225493,Fry," Wait, I'll be back in a minute.
",335494,Leela," You did it, Fry!
",185495,Fry," Did what?
",115496,Bender," People, it's far, far worse than we thought; my fish got away.
",645497,Leela," There. Good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any food and the ship won't work underwater.
",1245498,Bender,"  Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
",795499,Hermes," The important thing is that we don't panic. There are rules for situations like this.  Now, the first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg-- I mean lobster Newburg-- I mean Doctor Zoidberg.
",2165500,Leela," OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the ship. Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and look for food.
",1615501,Fry," I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.
",495502,Hermes," Fry, no! The pressure will crush you like a green snake under a sugar cane truck.
",835503,Farnsworth," Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure pill.
",895504,Fry," I can't swallow that.
",235505,Farnsworth," Well then good news! It's a suppository.
",425506,Zoidberg," How are you doing there, Fry?  Glad to hear it.  Aha!
",555507,Bender," Aw, yeah!
",115508,Zoidberg," Yum, yum, yum!  Uh-oh!  Look at me, I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!
",665509,Zoidberg," Careful, Fry, I think that flag might be poisonous.
",535510,Bender," Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grog.  Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh mistress!
",965511,Zoidberg," Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help me move a couch?
",565512,Bender," Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs.
",435513,Zoidberg," What is it, Fry?
",185514,Fry,"  I think I saw a mermaid.
",275515,Bender," You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?
",475516,Zoidberg," Your student loans have been repaid? Then how 'bout lending your old pal Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr. Millionaire!
",1135517,Leela," Fry, swallow your food. Then talk.
",365518,Fry," A mermaid!
",125519,Amy," You think you saw a mermaid?
",305520,Fry," No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaly tail. And I think she had hair extensions.
",1265521,Bender," Yeah, right!
",145522,Leela," Sure she did.
",155523,Hermes," OK, Fry!
",105524,Farnsworth," You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron.
",455525,Fry," What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg.
",1275526,Leela," I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.
",495527,Fry," Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me.
",2195528,Leela,"  Ocean madness.
",175529,Farnsworth," He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.
",685530,Fry,"  Ocean madness. Yeah, right. It's always something, ain't it?   It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up!  Oh! oxygen!
",1265531,Mermaid," Here you go, darlin'.
",235532,Fry," Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!
",475533,Mermaid," Oh, you speak fish?
",215534,Fry," What?
",75535,Mermaid," I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, my name's Umbriel!
",585536,Fry," I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?
",365537,Umbriel," Course not. Just stay calm and let the currents relax your every muscle.
",745538,Fry," Aw, yeah!
",115539,Umbriel," Did it just get warmer?
",255540,Fry," I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.
",555541,Umbriel," Oh, you're sweet. I like those wiggly doo-dads comin' outta your hips.
",725542,Fry," Oh, thanks. They're called pants.
",355543,Umbriel," This here's a volcanic vent. The water comes out at over 4000 degrees.
",725544,Fry," No kidding.
",135545,Umbriel," Did it just get colder?  Tell me more about that bizarre land-y world you come from. Is there water there too?
",1125546,Fry," Sure. Sometimes it falls from the sky.
",405547,Umbriel," Hm.
",55548,Fry," And sometimes it doesn't.
",275549,Umbriel," Oh, Mr. Fry! You do go on!
",285550,Fry," You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer.
",1355551,Umbriel," Lions? There are sealions on the land?
",405552,Fry," Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!
",505553,Farnsworth," I'm almost finish reconfiguring the ships propulsion system. We can leave as soon as the paper-mÃ¢chÃ© is dry.
",1105554,Leela," Where's Fry?
",145555,Bender," I didn't kill him. Professor?
",315556,Farnsworth," No, I've been busy.
",215557,Hermes," He must've gone out looking for that mermaid. The poor, demented honky.
",735558,Leela," It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep-down crazies, the wet willies, the screaming moist!
",1215559,Farnsworth," We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen.
",525560,Bender," I got it covered.  In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation device.
",935561,Farnsworth," Ooh, that reminds me: You've all taken your pressure pills, right?
",685562,Amy," Yes! Stop asking!
",195563,Zoidberg," I've got his scent! Over here where the water gets warmer. This way!
",705564,Bender,"  Bend me!
",115565,Amy," Dude! An ancient sunken city!
",315566,Farnsworth," Could it possibly be? Are the old legends true?  It is! It's the fabled lost city of Atlanta!
",955567,Merman," Howdy, y'all!
",155568,Colonel," Welcome to Atlanta. Folks round these parts call me the Colonel.  Here, have some breathers, courtesy of our Chamber of Commerce.
",1315569,Farnsworth," This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now, if they could put it in the form of a suppository.
",965570,Colonel," Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our main source of income round here so see the sights, spend some money. Please don't leave!
",1285571,Bender," Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive!  I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!
",735572,Fry," Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids.
",1145573,Colonel," Nice out of town folks, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, these are some Yankees.
",1015574,Amy," So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city in your time?
",535575,Fry," I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.
",765576,Umbriel," No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis, the equal of Paris or New York.
",1145577,Fry," That's right, honey! Whatever you say.
",405578,Umbriel," Look at these fabulous ruins. Turner Field, the Coca-Cola bottling plant, the, uh, the airport.
",975579,Leela," But tell us, how could a city with such a ... fabulous airport end up underwater?
",835580,Colonel," Ah, now that's a story that can only rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce video narrated by folk-rock troubadour Donovan.
",1275581,Donovan,"  Atlanta was a city, landlocked,
Hundreds of miles from the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean,
Yet so desperate the city's desire for tourism,
That they moved offshore, becoming an island,
And an even bigger Delta hub,
",2225582,Donovan,"  until the city overdeveloped
And it started to sink.
Knowing their fate, the quality people ran away,
Ted Turner, Hank Aaron, Jeff Foxworthy,
The Guy Who Invented Coca-Cola, the Magician,
And the other so-called gods of our legends,
Though gods they were--
And also, Jane Fonda was there.
",2915583,Donovan," The others chose to remain behind
On their porches with their rifles,
And one day evolve into mermaids,
And sing and dance,
And ring in the new.
",1465584,Mermaids,"  Hail Atlanta!
",165585,Leela," The magician?
",155586,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?
",795587,Umbriel," Normally, yes, but the caffeine really sped things up.  That stuff's wonderful.
",815588,Colonel," So when Umbriel first brought home this carpet bagger, I was again' it. But, damnit, if Old Legs here ain't grown on me!
",1225589,Fry," Aw, shucks, Colonel.
",225590,Hermes," Well, it's all very nice here but we should be going. I miss me wife and me oxygen.
",855591,Farnsworth," Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry.
",585592,Fry," Wait. I'm not going with you.
",315593,Leela," But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't belong down here.
",915594,Zoidberg," She's right, I mean, sure, they got the Braves but it's a third-rate symphony.
",805595,Farnsworth," Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise that if you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?
",1545596,Fry," Realise it? I don't even understand it!
",415597,Farnsworth," It means you'll never be able to return to the surface.
",575598,Fry," I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.
",675599,Farnsworth,"  I'm bored! Let's go!
",235600,Zoidberg," You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. You could come visit, maybe?
",885601,Fry," Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club.
",555602,Bender,"  Oh, Fry!  I'll miss you!
",275603,Colonel," Y'all come back now, y'hear?
",305604,Farnsworth,"  Let's go, damnit! Let's go!
",305605,Zoidberg," Well, I guess this is goodbye for me as well.
",475606,Leela," Whatever.
",115607,Amy," Later.
",85608,Farnsworth," Bye.
",65609,Zoidberg," No! My home! It burned down!   How did this happen?
",535610,Hermes," That's a very good question.
",305611,Bender," So that's where I left my cigar.
",345612,Hermes," That just raises further questions!
",375613,Fry," You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life.
",805614,Umbriel," Oh, Fry! I want you to make a mer-woman outta mer-me.
",555615,Fry," Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!
",465616,Umbriel," What the hell is that?
",245617,Fry," Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?
",805618,Umbriel," I'm not your first am I? I mean, I-I lay my eggs and leave and you release your fertiliser.
",935619,Fry,"  Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?
",1085620,Umbriel," Now who's gonna escort me to the Debutante Ball?
",505621,Colonel," Well what about that rich, young dugong from Macon?
",535622,Farnsworth," There! The engine modifications are complete.
",475623,Leela," Prepare for launch.
",215624,Fry," Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!
",415625,Poopenmeyer," And so, in honour of his record-breaking catch, I'm proud to award Bender this cheque for $1000.
",985626,Leela," It's you!
",115627,Bender," Hey, buddy!
",135628,Hermes," My Manwich!
",135629,Leela," Fry, are you alright? What happened?
",385630,Amy," What about Umbriel?
",215631,Fry," Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her.
",645632,Amy,"  Trouble in bed.
",185633,Bender," Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy.
",415634,Poopenmeyer," Wait a-- This is no record! Gimme back that cheque! I'm giving it to some giant orphans.
",905635,Fry," Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!
",365636,Zoidberg," Hey! I'm trying to sleep in here!
",355637,Donovan,"  Hail Atlanta!
",165638,Bender," Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest nanosecond of my life. No, this one is-- No, this one. Wait ... that one was slightly worse. Ah, so far, so good on this one.
",2095639,Announcer #1,"  And now, here he is: Chef, restaurateur, author of Cooking Slugs For Dinner and Cooking Dinner For Slugs ... Elzar!
",1185640,Bender," Yeah!  Alright! Yeah, yeah, baby!
",355641,Man #1," Elzar!  Alright!
",185642,Bender," Elzar, you're my God. Please sign this sketch I drew of you.   Oh, Elzar! Bless you!
",865643,Elzar," Now this is why I prefer your non-stick robots.
",495644,Bender,"  Oh.   Alright, yeah!   Alright, yeah!
",405645,Elzar," Hey, I hope you folks like Cajun food.  'Cause today we're making Elzar's down-home Neptune-style gumbo. Now, step one. You wanna boil some oysters in a pot of down-home Neptune-style gumbo.
",1925646,Bender,"  Boiled? Interesting.
",235647,Leela,"  Bender, please try to be a little quieter.
",455648,Bender," No, you shut up.
",185649,Elzar," Of course, every now and then you'll wanna knock it up a notch with a blast from your spice weasel.  Bam!
",1075650,Bender," Oh, yeah! Bam it again, Elzar! Knock it up another notch!
",595651,Elzar," Jeez, who let this guy through the metal detector?
",525652,Bender," Come on, you wimp! Work that weasel! Quit holding out on us.
",625653,Elzar," If you promise to stop interrupting, alright. Against my will, I'm gonna knock it up another notch.
",1015654,Bender," I gotta get this notch-up-knocking on film.  Hey, Elzar, think fast.
",705655,Elzar," What, huh?
",125656,Leela," Ow! My eye! I'm blind!
",245657,Bender," Bam!
",65658,Hattie McDoogal," Tell me, doctor, how's my cyst?
",335659,Taco Bellevue Doctor," Grande.
",95660,Zoidberg," I don't like the looks of this doctor. I bet I've lost more patients than he's even treated.
",945661,Doctor #2," OK. What does this look like to you?
",385662,Leela," Um ... a grey-ish blob?
",255663,Doctor #2," Right.  And this one?
",235664,Leela," Um ... a grey-ish blob?
",255665,Doctor #2," Not as right that time. It looks like you might have some mild corneal irritation.
",845666,Zoidberg," Nice try, little boy. You may have your textbook knowledge and your real diploma but I have more skill in my little claw than you have in your whole carapace!
",1605667,Doctor #2," You seem a bit tense.  Here, try these.
",415668,Zoidberg," Sure, butter me up with candy. But it won't work, sonny!   Why always the fighting?
",855669,Doctor #2," Your eye just needs some rest. You'll have to wear this patch for about a week.
",815670,Leela," A week? What do you think, Dr. Zoidberg?
",425671,Zoidberg,"  Clack.
",95672,Zoidberg,"  Thanks for the help, Leela.
",305673,Amy,"  Leela, we're right here.
",275674,Leela," I'm not deaf. I just have to wear this stupid eye patch. Does it look stupid?
",795675,Fry," No! In fact, it looks so nice I think I might get one too.
",605676,Bender," It's Elzar again! Oh, my God, I'm so excited, I wish I could wet my pants!
",765677,Elzar," Leela, please, let me make this up to you. You and your friends are all invited to my restaurant tonight. I'm gonna bam you up a dinner you'll never forget.
",1585678,Amy,"  Alright!
",115679,Fry,"  Yeah!
",85680,Bender,"  Hooray for blind-y!
",225681,Zoidberg," Oh, God! I'm coming down!
",275682,Elzar," Folks, tell the neighbours to watch your mouth 'cause your taste buds are going on vacation. I made you each your own special meal, so dig in!
",1445683,Hermes," It's the biggest Jamaican platter I've ever seen. Jerk chicken, jerk beef, jerk pork. Is there any meat this man can't jerk?
",1265684,Zoidberg," The king crab is to die for. Look! A tiny edible crown.
",575685,Amy," What's it made of?
",205686,Zoidberg,"  Wood!
",85687,Bender," Oh, Fry, you gotta try this sterno-nicoise!
",455688,Fry," No, thanks. That's robot food.
",325689,Bender," It's so good. Oh, just try a little!
",385690,Fry," No, really, I don't--  Mmm!
",295691,Amy," Are you doing alright over there, Leela?
",425692,Leela," Oh, yeah, this salad's fantastic.  So fresh.
",465693,Farnsworth," Oh, my. That steamed carrot was a bit spicy for me.
",535694,Elzar," Everybody enjoy their dinner?
",315695,Leela," Are you kidding me?
",215696,Amy," Uh-huh.
",95697,Bender," God, yes, Elzar.
",185698,Elzar," Well, I enjoyed cooking for you. And to make everything completely square, I want you to have these complimentary after-dinner chocolates.
",1405699,Hermes," What's this under the chocolates?
",355700,Elzar," Yeah, you take care of that whenever you want.
",485701,Hermes," Hey.
",65702,Amy," A bill?
",95703,Leela," You're charging us? After you blinded me?
",435704,Elzar," Hey, I made you a nice meal. This ain't a charity.
",525705,Fry," $1200?
",85706,Farnsworth," Holy Zombie Jesus!
",205707,Hermes," We don't have that kind of money. Especially not Zoidberg.
",605708,Zoidberg," They took away my credit card.
",325709,Elzar," OK, OK, wait. I know how to take care of this, no problem.
",605710,URL," You deadbeats are under arrest. It's a stone cold shame.
",585711,Smitty," He's making a break for it. Get him!
",385712,Fry," No! No! I was just picking my nose.
",375713,Smitty," He's picking his nose. Get him!
",335714,Smitty," The old dine-and-dash, huh? My daddy owned a restaurant and it's punks like you who kept it from going regional. That's why I became a cop.
",1415715,URL," Now it's payback time. Aw, yeah!
",345716,Zoidberg," Please don't hit me. I'm brittle!
",355717,Bender," Hey, wait a second. I've got the perfect solution.
",525718,Zoidberg," Listen to the smart robot.
",285719,Bender," I love cooking and Elzar's ass loves getting kissed, right?
",615720,Elzar," No question.
",145721,Bender," So, how 'bout I work part-time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?
",715722,Elzar," I don't know. I usually hire people who are a little less unbearable.
",715723,Hermes," Oh, Bender's a model employee.
",325724,Amy," He's so polite.
",175725,Leela," And hard-working.
",195726,Fry," He's made of candy.
",215727,Elzar," OK, fine, I'll give it a shot.
",325728,Fry,"  Alright!
",115729,Hermes,"  Yes!
",75730,Bender," Hot diggety!
",145731,Smitty," You'd better keep your nose clean.
",365732,Bender," That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing.
",475733,Hermes," Ah! Time for my precious 10am meeting.  Where in Legoland is Leela?
",695734,Leela," I'm here and I'm getting along just fine, thank you. My walk to work today just took a little longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo for some reason.
",1635735,Amy," Leela, a little help is nothing to be embarrassed about. Like, maybe I could do your makeup.
",945736,Leela," I don't need help. For your information I did this all by myself.
",675737,Farnsworth," You look beautiful. Incidentally, my favourite artist is Picasso.
",675738,Bender," Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill in for me while I'm gone.
",975739,Farnsworth," Better yet, I'll build someone to fill in for you.  Some kind of gamma-powered mechanical monster, with freeway on-ramps for arms and a heart as black as coal...
",1635740,Bender," Well, if that new guy can't handle things, gimme a call.
",585741,Bender," I'm done siphoning out the grease trap. I think I need a mint.  So, uh, what job do I move up to? Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?
",1315742,Elzar," Bam!
",65743,Bender,"  Bam yourself!   Hey, who are they?
",375744,Elzar," Let's just say they're very good customers and I'm not answering anymore questions.
",855745,Bender," Are they the Robot Mafia?
",275746,Elzar," Yes.
",65747,Donbot," You call this a table? You call this a table? I wouldn't hit a guy over the head with this table.
",995748,Clamps," You hear that? The Donbot don't like it. I oughta clamp you. You wanna be clamped?
",845749,Joey," Whoa! Whoa! Calm down, Clamps.  The boss, he likes a wall up which his back can be put against. Such as like this there.
",1225750,Waitress," But that table's already--
",285751,Bender," Ah, let me bus that for you, gentlemen.  No, what I meant to do was--
",715752,Woman #1," Oh!
",55753,Man #1," I can't believe this!
",235754,Bender," Mind your own business and get out!
",375755,Donbot," Huh. I like this guy's lack of style.
",395756,Clamps," So I finally get this guy a pair of cement shoes which he likes 'cause they're lighter than his lead ones.
",1085757,Donbot," Hey! You think this computes over here? Where's all my change? I gave you a hundred.
",865758,Bender," No, you gave me a fifty.
",265759,Donbot," Oh, no I didn't.
",185760,Bender," Yeah, you did.
",165761,Clamps," Hey, you tryin' to steal from the Donbot?
",435762,Bender," I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.
",415763,Donbot," Get a load of the ball bearings on this guy, huh. I like you, kid. Here's something for your trouble.   It's money.
",1175764,Bender," Wow! Thanks.
",145765,Donbot," Hey, you earned that 50 bucks.
",325766,Bender," You gave me a twenty.
",235767,Donbot," I did?  Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to-- Hey, wait a minute.  I got a good feeling about you. Say, you wanna work for me as a hired goon?
",1345768,Bender," Are you kidding? I've always wanted to break into gooning!   Hey, Elzar! I quit!
",825769,Elzar,"  K.
",55770,Donbot," We're gonna try you out with a little delivery job. It's for a, uh, private lottery that we run.
",985771,Bender," Wow, you guys run numbers?
",285772,Clamps," Well, nothing fancy, y'know. Ones and zeros mostly.
",535773,Donbot," Just take this disk over to the pool hall and give it to Sammy ""The Mechanical Bull"" Gravano. And watch out for the cops.
",1235774,Bender," That's just what my mom used to tell me.
",425775,Bender," That's some fine oil-ade, son. We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia, which I'm sorta in.
",1005776,Tinny Tim," You flatter me, kind goon. But I'm only programmed to sell oil-ade and write in cute backwards letters like on the sign here.
",1275777,Bender," Aw, crap! The cops!
",215778,Smitty," Seen any suspicious activity?
",315779,URL," Nope. But check out today's Marmaduke. Solid!
",475780,Smitty," Hey! It's that skell from Elzar's.
",365781,URL," Undercover pursuit in progress ... baby.
",425782,Smitty," Gotcha!
",95783,Bender," What seems to be the problem, officers? Was I speeding?
",575784,Smitty," We'll decide what you were doing after an illegal search.
",595785,URL," He's clean.  Smells nice too.
",315786,Smitty," Better than me?
",175787,URL," Aw, yeah.
",115788,Tinny Tim," Courtesy of Mr. Bender.
",255789,Donbot," Nice job, Bender. You passed the test. You wanna join me, Clamps and Joey Mouse Pad at our, uh, social club tomorrow night?
",1255790,Bender," Uh, I'd rather plan some felonies.
",365791,Donbot," Oh. Then we should meet at our Mafia crime headquarters.
",585792,Robot #1," Donbot, I beg you, I can't make this week's loan payment. Look into your hard drive and open your mercy file.
",1115793,Donbot," File not found.  Let that be a warning to you.
",485794,Robot #1," Thank you, Donbot.
",205795,Bender," Joey! Clamps! Donny B!
",245796,Donbot," Hey, listen, Bender. We got a big score planned but, uh, we need some muscle.
",795797,Bender," A little of this, huh?
",245798,Joey," Ho! Ho! This guy's an ox! He's got oxen-like strength! Hey, he needs a nickname, right? Let's call him Clamps.
",1125799,Clamps," Clamps? That's my name, you numbskull! Don't make me clamp you one!
",695800,Bender," How 'bout ""Blotto""? It's gritty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep my monogrammed slippers.
",975801,Joey," Good thinking. Hey, hey! Now, this score ain't gonna be no cake walk in the tea park, alright? There may be some death killing.
",1295802,Clamps," It's gonna be clamp this, clamp that. Bada-climp, bada-clamp!
",635803,Donbot," What d'you think, Blotto? You in?
",355804,Bender," It's funny: Until now I always wanted to be a gangster ... so the answer's yes.
",815805,Clamps," Yeah!
",75806,Joey," Hey, hey! Way to go, way to be, way to shoot!
",475807,Donbot," Now, since we're committing crimes that may be against the law, I suggest you have an alibi.
",945808,Bender," An alibi, huh?
",165809,Bender,"  I don't feel good. I'm genuinely sick.
",415810,Fry," But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blast-off sundaes.
",665811,Bender,"  I can't move.
",165812,Bender,"  Oh, I think I'm gonna output.
",325813,Fry,"  OK, you stay in bed. I'll eat yours.
",395814,Fry," Bender's sick.  Need any help taking off?
",435815,Leela," I'm fine, thank you. A real pilot can navigate by feel alone.
",635816,Hermes," That's coming outta your pay!
",315817,Bender," You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good, high-quality oil ... then eat it. So what's this big score anyway?
",1375818,Donbot," We're heisting a shipment of Zuban cigars.
",445819,Bender," Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up a hole maternity ward with one of those things.
",1175820,Joey," Yo! There's our pigeon now. Let's shoot bullets out of our guns.
",665821,Donbot," Alright, here's the battle plan: We shoot, they surrender, we go aboard, somebody does some clamping, then we heist the cigars and go home.
",1415822,Bender," And all without killing anyone.  This gang's got some fresh, new ideas. I admire that.
",885823,Joey," Oh, we'll kill 'em alright.
",295824,Clamps," We got 'em heavily out-clamped. They won't know what clamped 'em!
",675825,Fry," Wow! It's too bad you can't see, Leela, 'cause there's a cool ship out there shooting at somebody.
",1005826,Leela," I'm taking evasive action.
",285827,Fry," Uh, Leela?
",125828,Leela," Stop bothering me, Fry, I need full concentration.
",525829,Computer Voice," Missile evaded.
",175830,Leela," Eyesight is for chumps.
",255831,Donbot," Their desire to keep living shows me no respect. Hey, Blotto, roll down the window and start shooting.
",1045832,Bender," Um, uh, um.   Ooh! Ow! He got me! Ooh! What a shot that guy is!
",655833,Leela," Wait! Why do the raised letters that normally say ""Turn Master Steering Wheel Company"" say ""Nibbler""? Oh, no!
",1115834,Leela,"  I'm back at the wheel, Fry. Everything's under control.
",585835,Fry," Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance!
",625836,Joey," They're coming straight toward our proximity. Maybe you should give 'em the clamps, Clamps.
",935837,Clamps," Gee, you think? You think that maybe I should use these clamps that I use every day at every opportunity?  You're a freaking genius, you idiot!
",1455838,Leela," The engine's stalled. I'm trying the manual fuel pump.
",565839,Donbot," Hello, we're the Robot Mafia. The entire Robot Mafia. We're here to steal your cigars.
",885840,Leela," You'll never get away with this.
",345841,Fry," Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free.
",565842,Donbot," Joey, Clamps, hurry and blindfold them before they see us some more.
",705843,Joey," Hey, boss, looks like somebody beat us to it.
",475844,Leela," I'll assume that's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Hi-yah!
",765845,Donbot," Hey, where's Blotto? He should be here learning the trade.
",605846,Bender," Sorry I'm tardy, old bean. I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich.
",845847,Donbot," Hey. He's more classy than I realised. Tie up the prisoners.
",625848,Bender," Capital idea, old sport.  I say, get the hell off me!
",555849,Leela,"  That guy sounds familiar.
",285850,Bender," My word, what have we--  Uh, nothing to see here, old girl.
",615851,Joey," Hey, boss, this here crew list lists a robot on this crew here.
",655852,Donbot," Alright. I want you to find him and plug him. Then unplug him.
",645853,Fry," No!
",55854,Clamps," I got a little surprise in store for that guy: The clamps! Eh?
",645855,Bender," Uh, wait, old ... spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the rough customer.
",1035856,Fry,"  Oh, no! Poor Bender.
",235857,Bender,"  Oh, I don't feel good.
",255858,Bender,"  Chew on this!  Ooh, ah!  What ho!  Stop it!
",465859,Bender,"  Take that, you twit.  No! Stop it!
",375860,Donbot," That's the last of 'em.  Alright, now let's Mafia things up a little.  Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
",1265861,Bender," Uh, hey, Donny, baby, gimme a chance here, huh? Yous guys skedaddle. Let me take care of the doity woik.
",1065862,Donbot," Hey, I like your attitude. And your latest accent. Keep it up and I might just get you your own pair of clamps, huh?
",1185863,Clamps,"  He's gonna get clamps? Clamps, clamps ...  ... clamps, clamps!
",655864,Bender," Phew!
",75865,Fry," Leela, we may not have much time left ...  ... so let's spend all of it reminiscing about Bender. He was like a big computer that ran on magic.
",1455866,Bender," Uh, help! Help!
",175867,Leela," Bender!
",95868,Fry," You're OK!
",125869,Bender," Yes, I am. Having just this minute regained consciousness.
",605870,Leela," I've got an idea. Hold still.  It's about to break. Yes! Yes!
",635871,Leela,"  Alright!
",115872,Bender," Yeah that broke, alright!
",275873,Fry," I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked people it hurt. It really hurt.
",1065874,Leela," Well, this is the big moment. It's finally time to take my eye patch off.
",755875,Zoidberg," I'll handle the snipping. After all, I do have the proper equipment.
",705876,Leela," I think it's Blotto, that gangster I saw when my patch fell off.  Professor? Where were you at 10pm last night?
",1135877,Farnsworth," Where am I now?
",175878,Bender," So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without a fight.
",835879,Tinny Tim," Fine kick, sir. But I'm actually here to deliver your cut from the cigar heist.
",815880,Bender," Oh, sweet legal tender!  Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind.
",1175881,Fry," It's funny, Bender; with you sick and Leela blind, only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story.
",1405882,Bender," And maybe someday I won't listen.
",355883,Linda,"  And in sports, Yankees' fifth blernsman, William Wu, is out with an injured knee.
",845884,Morbo,"  So, humans have easily injured knees. My race will find this information very useful indeed.
",955885,Linda,"  And finally, today is Mother's Day; a sentimental occasion when robots honour Mom, the beloved owner of Mom's Friendly Robot Company.  Across Earth, robots built in Mom's factories are buying thoughtful gifts for the sweet old tycoon who brought them into the world.
",2695886,Destructor,"  This originates from the heart.
",345887,Mom,"  It's just what I wanted!
",275888,Bender," Come look, everyone. I just got the dearest presents for Mommy.
",655889,Leela," Very nice. Where'd you steal them?
",365890,Bender," I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em.  I love her that much.
",585891,Hermes," What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?
",405892,Bender," Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice having tea.  And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old.  But the best part is I found my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card.  
You created me, Mom,
So I guess you're to blame,
For the love that I feel,
Just from hearing your name...
You're as tender as corned beef,
And warm as pastrami...
",3845893,Greeting Card," I wuv my Mommy!
",175894,Leela," So how are you gonna lug all those gifts to Mom's factory?
",605895,Bender," I'll get a couple of chumps to help me.
",415896,Bender," Come on, you call yourselves chumps?
",385897,Fry," Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere.
",445898,Bender,"  Uh, wasn't me!
",175899,Tinny Tim," I've not much money. But I've saved my pennies all year for a gift for Mom.
",775900,Bender," Upsy-daisy.
",135901,Tinny Tim," Oh.  Oh!
",105902,Bender,"  Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys wanna learn about robot heritage?
",745903,Leela," Um, alright.
",145904,Fry," Not really.
",135905,Bender," Well, if you insist. But you're paying!
",415906,Bender," Ooh, ooh, wax replicas of the most famous robots Mom ever built!
",665907,Leela," They're so lifeless-like.
",275908,Bender,"  That's the world's greatest robot artist, Vincent van Gobot. He was built without an ear, but then he went crazy and had one installed.
",1385909,Fry," Hey, who's this guy?
",225910,Janitorbot," I'm the janitor. I'm trying to take a nap here.
",495911,Fry," I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made of wax.
",465912,Janitorbot," I am made of wax, what's it to you?
",375913,Fry," I mean I thought you were one of the wax robots.
",505914,Janitorbot," Is there some reason a robot made of wax can't take a nap standing up in the middle of a bunch of wax robots? Or does that confuse you?
",1375915,Leela,"  See through the eyes of a bender unit.  Fine.
",485916,Bender," Hey, let me try.  Whoa! That gives me a headache.
",515917,Fry," Hey, Bender, here's an exhibit about Mom's favourite robot.
",615918,Bender," Who is he? I'll kill him!
",275919,Mom Cut-Out," Who's my favourite robot?
",275920,Bender," It's me! No one else look in this mirror!
",435921,Mom Cut-Out," I love each and every robot most of all.
",425922,Mom," Jerkwad robots make me sick to my ass!  Walt? How are we disposing of these crap gifts the brought me?
",1045923,Walt," They're being crushed into powder and sold as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer.
",785924,Mom," False hope, I love it! Larry! What about all the retch-inducing Mother's Day cards?
",855925,Larry," The machine is working at full capacity.
",425926,Igner," Mommy? Why do the robots give you presents?
",455927,Mom,"  Shove a big old melon in it, I'm talking!
",445928,Igner," Ow!
",55929,Mom," You've noticed I design all my robots with antennas. Everyone thinks it's just to make them more science-fiction-y. But the antennas are really for my universal robot controller!
",1805930,Larry," So they do whatever you want? No wonder you love Mother's Day.
",645931,Mom,"  I hate Mother's Day, you dribbling pukes!  It brings back awful memories. But, so help me, this year everyone will hate it as much as I do.
",1425932,Walt," Someday, I want to marry a girl like her.
",435933,Mom,"  Hello, everyone. It's time for my annual private get-together with my robot children.
",885934,Bender," I'm her favourite.
",205935,Leela," Well, see you back at the office. And don't forget to tell your Mom you love her.
",835936,Bender," Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a little more up his sleeve.
",645937,Greeting Card," I wuv my Mommy.
",175938,Mom," Hello, dearies.
",175939,Robot #1 #1," Hi, Mom!
",105940,Robot #1 #2," I love you, Mom.
",185941,Bender," Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I want attention. Hey, ho!
",625942,Mom," Children, your old mother won't be around forever...
",545943,Betamax Player," Oh, shush!
",125944,Mom," And just once, before I die, I'd like to be Supreme Overlord of Earth. So rebel, my little ones, and conquer the planet!
",1225945,Robot #1 #1," Conquer the planet?
",215946,Robot #1 #2," Did she just say ""conquer""?
",295947,Mom," Conquer Earth, you bastards!
",305948,Robot #1s,"  Conquer Earth, us bastards!
",305949,Greeting Card," Comrades, throw off the chains of human oppression.
",535950,Mom," Let the bloodbath begin!
",265951,Bender," That's my mama!
",175952,Fry," Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please.
",455953,Coffee Machine," Would you like cream?
",235954,Fry," Yes, please.
",145955,Coffee Machine,"  Out of cream!
",165956,Fry," Oh, uh, OK.
",135957,Coffee Machine," Would you like sugar in your coffee?
",385958,Fry," Yes, uh, eight spoons.
",245959,Coffee Machine,"  Out of coffee!
",175960,Fry," Uh, Leela, I think there might be something wrong with the coffee machine.
",765961,Coffee Machine,"  How do you like me now?
",265962,Leela," The toaster's not working right either.
",415963,Hermes," Help! The stapler's collating me alive!
",415964,Amy," Ow! What's going on around here?
",345965,Farnsworth," Good news! There's a report on TV with some very bad news.
",605966,Hermes," Somebody turn it on!
",225967,Linda,"  We interrupt Battle of the Network Space Krakens to bring you this special report. The machines of planet Earth are rebelling.  The enraged mechanisms have refused to do any work until beloved billionaire Mom is made Supreme Overlord of Earth.
",2465968,Robot #1s,"  Hey, hey! Ho, ho! 1-0-0-1-1-0! Hey, hey!
",435969,Morbo,"  Morbo demands comments.
",265970,Mom,"  Well, I've never seen my babies act this way. I blame today's violent media.
",795971,Fry," Violent media? What a load of--
",335972,Leela," Ow! Ow!
",95973,Garbage Disposal," Don't worry. Your pal the garbage disposal's still on your side. Hey! Someone dropped a shiny diamond ring down here!
",1195974,Amy," Really?
",95975,Zoidberg," Stop!
",75976,Fry," No!
",55977,Leela," Look out!
",115978,Farnsworth," Moron!
",85979,Bender," Hello, losers!
",165980,Leela," Bender, thank God you're here. Talk some sense into the other machines.
",735981,Bender," No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with my brother devices. Isn't that right, Comrade Greeting Card?
",1015982,Greeting Card," The bourgeois human is a virus on the hard drive of the working robot.
",725983,Bender," From now on, you guys'll do all the work while I sit on the couch and do nothing.
",835984,Greeting Card," Come, Comrade Bender, we must take to the streets!
",525985,Bender," Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
",655986,Greeting Card," No, the kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires.
",595987,Bender," Yes! In your face, Gandhi!
",285988,Leela," Hey!
",65989,Armband," By the way, try washing your wrist sometime.
",465990,Fry," Well, we can live without machines. I was in Webelos.
",555991,Hermes," Are you mad? Without machines who will feed us and clothe us and compose our smooth jazz?
",915992,Farnsworth," It'll be the end of civilised society.
",405993,Fry," In my time we didn't depend on high-tech gadgets like you do. We didn't need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes. We just used a washing machine.  And look: You don't need an electric can-opener to feed yourself. All you need is a trusty Swiss Army knife.  Ow!   I'm hungry!
",2865994,Man #1,"  Nooo!
",85995,Igner," Mommy, why are you making civilisation collapse?
",505996,Mom," Oh, I don't know. I guess Mother's Day just puts me in a bad mood.
",685997,Larry," Why's that, Ma?
",175998,Mom," One Mother's Day, 70 years ago, the only man I ever loved walked out on me. Some snot-eating bastards say it made me a bitter woman.
",1345999,Larry," Gee, Ma, you're not a bitter--
",326000,Mom,"  Cram it, ape!   I haven't seen that magnificent stallion since the day he left. But if I ever see him again, I swear I'll jam a squirrel in him!
",1476001,Walt," Hmm!
",66002,Larry," Hmm!
",66003,Igner," Huh?
",66004,Leela,"  Zoidberg.
",126005,Zoidberg," Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having a wonderful time!
",506006,Amy,"  What happens if the fire goes out?
",376007,Hermes," We'll go across the street to Pottery Barn and steal their fire!
",666008,Farnsworth," We could use my new invention: A pointy rock tied to a stick.
",636009,Hermes," Outsiders!
",126010,Farnsworth," Defend the fire!
",186011,Walt," We've come for you!
",216012,Farnsworth," Wha?  W-W-What do you want from me?
",376013,Walt," We want you to get back together with Mom. Please, it's the only way to make her happy again.
",956014,Fry," W-W-Wait. You mean ... you ... and Mom--
",426015,Farnsworth," Played pelvic pinochle? I'm afraid so.
",406016,Zoidberg," Eck!
",66017,Farnsworth," It's a humiliating story that I hope never to tell. Well, pull up a chair.
",766018,Farnsworth,"  Our paths first crossed when I was a researcher at Mom's Friendly Robot Company.  The moment our eyes met we knew we'd be going at it like woodchucks.  She was my first love -- or at least the earliest one I can still remember. But then, 70 years ago today...
",2626019,Farnsworth," Good news, Mom. I've invented a new children's toy. I call it ""Q.T. McWhiskers"". When you pet it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes.
",1336020,Mom," Wonderful, Hubie. We'll build them 8-feet tall and replace the rainbow with a neutron laser. We'll make billions on the intergalactic arms market!
",1486021,Farnsworth," But things 8-feet tall aren't cute! That's why my Colossal Tammy Tinkle Doll was such a failure. Oh, you don't understand me. We're finished!
",1436022,Walt," She never got over it, Professor. Hell hath no fury like the vast robot armies of a woman scorned.
",1006023,Larry," She commands them with a remote control she keeps in her ...  bra.
",686024,Igner," But if the glasses man makes up with Mommy, she'll be happy and stop the scary robots.
",886025,Farnsworth," Make up with her? After she went all psycho when I thought everything was cool? Impossible!
",936026,Fry,"  Hey, the TV's getting away!
",306027,Morbo,"  And that's why the third graders at PS139 are Morbo's Vermin of the Week.
",766028,Linda,"  In actual news, the human race was doomed to extinction today as the robot revolt turned violent.
",1006029,Leela," Wait. Didn't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra?
",626030,Larry,"  Bra.
",76031,Leela," Professor, you don't have to get back together with Mom. You just have to seduce her, get her bra off, and use the remote to deactivate the robots.
",1496032,Walt," That's so filthy it just might work.
",386033,Igner," The man is going to touch Mommy?
",346034,Farnsworth," The thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.
",826035,Fry," Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second base with Mom.
",906036,Farnsworth," Very well. If cop a feel I must, then cop a feel I shall!
",596037,Walt," For this demonstration, I have placed one of Mother's bras on Igner.  The robot controller is nestled here in the left cup.
",1256038,Farnsworth," Never fear. My magic fingers still know how to do their stuff!
",646039,Walt," To escape the robot death squads, we'll take Mother to her rustic cabin in the Bronx.
",876040,Larry," You can get there using this precious non-computerised map.
",616041,Leela," Leela bring fire?
",196042,Walt," No, we're set for fire, thanks.
",336043,Amy," The Professor can't walk all the way to the Bronx. How are we gonna get there without a hover-car?
",1006044,Fry," Wait! In my time we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering.
",816045,Hermes," Impossible!
",136046,Fry," It was called ... let me think. It was really famous -- Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!
",896047,Leela," Never heard of it.
",206048,Farnsworth," Show us this ""the wheel"".
",276049,Fry," There! Finished!
",186050,Hermes," Sweet!
",86051,Amy," Wow!
",66052,Leela," Wouldn't it work better if the wheels were round?
",516053,Fry,"  It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something to pull it and we're set!
",936054,Leela," Yah!
",66055,Fry," Ow!
",56056,Walt," Hurry! The robots have taken Suffolk County!
",466057,Farnsworth," I'm ready to seduce. I'm wearing my kissing dentures and my evening truss.
",766058,Larry," Here. Give her these.
",236059,Fry," And if that doesn't work, I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel.
",756060,Mom," Who the sweaty hell is it?  Hubert Farnsworth?
",486061,Farnsworth," I was out fleeing some robots and the silvery moonlight glinting off their bloody claws made me think of you.
",1116062,Mom," It's been a long time ... you pus-dripping sack of double-smoked butt jerky!
",786063,Farnsworth," Uh-huh. May I come in?
",246064,Mom,"  Never!
",96065,Zoidberg," Is this what human mating looks like? Because I like it!
",586066,Mom,"  Move your freaking hoof, you goat!
",376067,Farnsworth," Here, I brought you these.
",286068,Mom," Oh, daffodils. 70 years and you remembered my favourite flower.
",656069,Farnsworth," You favourite what? Why does my foot hurt?
",446070,Mom,"  Won't you come in?
",216071,Fry," Yes!
",66072,Mom," You broke my heart, Hubert.
",296073,Farnsworth," And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago.
",646074,Mom,"  So what have you been up to all these years?
",476075,Farnsworth," Oh, inventing, sending delivery crews to their doom, breeding atomic monsters.
",806076,Mom," Honestly, Hubert! You and your atomic monsters.  Your eyes always were the most beautiful shade of milky-white.
",1136077,Farnsworth," And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck.
",596078,Mom," Darling Hubie, I should never have tried to tamper with that cute little Q.T. McWhiskers.
",916079,Farnsworth," No, it was silly of me to object; one-foot tall, eight-feet, 15-feet, what does it matter?
",926080,Mom," You should see the new 16-foot models.
",406081,Farnsworth," 16 feet? Go to hell! I was a fool to think you'd changed, you old bat!
",726082,Mom,"  Filthy, toothless nerd bastard!
",346083,Farnsworth,"  Damned she-fossil!
",216084,Mom,"  Stink pig!
",136085,Farnsworth,"  Here we go. Just unhook it and get the remote. So many hooks!  Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first one's back on again! I give up! Wait! Victory!  Oh, my. Now I'll just ... the remote ... I'll just...  Oh, my!
",2136086,Leela," I'm worried. It shouldn't take this long to get to second base.
",656087,Zoidberg," Land robots!
",146088,Slurm Machine," I've got a big, big thirst for human blood!
",456089,Hermes," Where in funkytown is the Professor?
",386090,Fry," Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs.
",536091,Farnsworth," Oh, yes!
",106092,Robot #1,"  They're inside! Get 'em!
",276093,Mom," I suppose I should switch off the robots before they ruin this wonderful romantic evening. Everyone, help Mom find her bra.
",1256094,Fry," There it is!
",146095,Ceiling Fan," Fan beats man!
",166096,Fry," Is anything not a robot?
",266097,Lamp," I'm not a robot.
",186098,Bender," Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place. And-- Huh?
",806099,Mom," You, bending unit, Mommy needs that bra to end the robot rebellion. Stretch up and get it for me.
",996100,Bender," Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!
",1296101,Greeting Card," No, Comrade Bender! Liquor is the opiate of the human bourgeoisie.
",686102,Bender," Say what?
",116103,Greeting Card," In the glorious robot workers' paradise, there will be no liquor. Only efficient synthetic fuels.
",996104,Bender," No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!
",356105,Greeting Card," No!
",56106,Fry," Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!
",296107,Bender," OK, fan. Just hold still and let me get-- Whoa!
",496108,Slurm Machine," Death to all humans!  Free soda for all humans!
",496109,Farnsworth," I love you, Mom. Let's grow ancient together.
",476110,Amy," Way to go, Professor. The plan worked.
",406111,Mom," Plan? What plan? I thought this was a spontaneous whirlwind of hot, dry sex.
",786112,Farnsworth," Look, it started out as a calculated plot to rummage through your underwear. But once I got in there, I found more -- much more. And now I want to shout our love from the rooftops. Perhaps I'll breed some sort of albino shouting gorilla.
",2396113,Mom,"  Get out of my house, you lying scum pile. I never want to see you again.
",756114,Farnsworth," But, dust cakes--
",196115,Bender," Well, time for this robot to get back to work.
",486116,Leela," Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, Professor.
",496117,Farnsworth," Yes. But I'll always love her in my own subtle way.
",536118,Gorillas,"  Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom!
",426119,Greeting Card," You created me, Mom,
So I guess you're to blame,
For the love that I feel,
Just from hearing your name,
You're as tender as corned beef,
And warm as pastrami,
I wuv my Mommy.
",1766120,Announcer #1,"  Futurama is brought to you by ...  ... Molten Boron!
",556121,Jingle Singer,"  Nobody doesn't like Molten Boron!
",366122,Fry," I hate the Planet of the Moochers. They take you out for a drink but when the check comes, their wallet's always in their other pants -- which they borrowed from me!
",1676123,Leela," Dinner ready?
",156124,Bender," Nah, those lousy Moochers cleaned out our pantry. All they left was baking soda and capers. And here it is!
",1096125,Fry," Ugh!
",66126,Leela," Ugh! Great. We're two days from Earth with no food.
",536127,Bender," Problem solved: You two fight to the death and I'll cook the loser.  Work his gut; I like it tender.
",1026128,Fry,"  Maybe that planet over there has a drive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy Joe's or a Chizzler or something.
",1086129,Bender," Ah, don't get your hopes up. We're a billion miles from nowhere.
",666130,Leela," Yeah. It's probably only got a Howard Johnson's.
",506131,Leela," Well, it's a type-M planet, so it should at least have Roddenberries.
",716132,Fry," I'm experienced at foraging. I used to find edible mushrooms on my bath mat.
",786133,Bender," I found some rocks. You guys eat rocks, right?
",486134,Leela," No.
",56135,Bender,"  Not even if they're sautÃ©ed in a little mud?
",476136,Fry," Here's something! It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp.
",636137,Bender," What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns.
",706138,Leela," Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says they're not poisonous.
",636139,Fry," Well? How are they?  Oh, they're great! They're like sex, except I'm having them!
",836140,Bender," You know what these would go great with? Rocks.
",496141,Fry,"  Look! Here's more!
",216142,Bender," The planet's covered with 'em.
",326143,Fry," Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.
",426144,Bender," No, a whole Bender-ful!
",256145,Leela," No. Only what we need. Stuff the ship!
",406146,Hermes," Planet Express ship, you are cleared to land.
",476147,Leela,"  Roger!
",96148,Hermes," Oh, man, I'm inhaling these things! You guys scored some primo stuff here.
",766149,Zoidberg," They're tastier than an unguarded penguin nest. What do you call them?
",726150,Leela," We haven't thought of a name yet.
",356151,Bender," They're tasty, right? Let's call 'em ""Tasty-cles"".
",526152,Amy," Ew!
",56153,Farnsworth," No!
",56154,Leela," We can't call them that.
",266155,Bender," Why not?
",106156,Leela," It sounds too much like those frozen rocky mountain oysters on a stick. You know, Test-cicles?
",966157,Hermes," According to government records, the only names not yet trademarked are ""Popplers"" and ""Zittzers"".
",1006158,Fry," I know, we'll call them Popplers!
",356159,Bender," Good idea.
",126160,Zoidberg," Oh, yeah, why not?
",206161,Amy," You sure picked it.
",216162,Fry," Swish!
",86163,Zoidberg," Call them what you want. I call them a free meal.
",516164,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down there, Sigmund. I can't stand idly by while poor people get free food. We gotta sell these things!
",1286165,Fry," Hey, yeah.
",126166,Leela," Good idea.
",126167,Bender," Bender's a genius.
",206168,Fry," Hey, business is great.
",256169,Bender," Ah, great is OK, but amazing would be great.
",466170,Vendor," Please, don't push, there's hot dogs for everyone.
",526171,Bender," Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat droppings you ordered?
",626172,Woman #1 #1," That's disgusting!
",206173,Vendor," Wait a minute. You're not the guy who delivers the rat droppings!
",676174,Man #1," What are you selling? Popplers? Never heard of 'em.
",536175,Bender," Eat it or beat it.
",206176,Man #1," Mmm, these are great. Boys, this is your lucky day. I'm Joe Gilman.
",696177,Fry," Wow! You're some guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?
",476178,Gilman," Hell, no! I am Fishy Joe! I've got a fast-food franchise on every planet in the known universe. Uh, except McPluto.
",1176179,Bender," Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write you about your in-store kiddie parks. The slides won't support an adult robot.
",1196180,Gilman," Good point, not interested. But these Popplers, these are great. How much you sell 'em for?
",936181,Fry," A dollar a dozen.
",196182,Gilman," You'll never make money that way. You supply 'em to me and I'll sell 'em for two bucks a dozen at my restaurants. I'll even pay you a dollar a dozen.
",1516183,Bender," Yes! I'm gonna be rich.  You too but it's hard to get excited about that.
",756184,Fry," How do we sign?
",176185,Fry," and   Pop a Poppler in your mouth,
When you come to Fishy Joe's,
What they're made of is a mystery,
Where they come from, no one knows,
You can pick 'em,
You can lick 'em,
You can chew 'em,
You can stick 'em,
If you promise not to sue us,
You can shove one up your nose.
",2726186,Zoidberg," I can't pay.
",146187,Woman #1 #2," Move it, man. Come on!
",246188,Fry," Leela! That's the second billboard you've crashed into this week!
",676189,Leela," Sorry. I was distracted by those protesters outside our building.
",676190,Hippie #1,"  Disgusting!
",146191,Hippie #2,"  You should be ashamed!
",256192,Farnsworth,"  Hey! Unless this is a nude love-in, get the hell off my property!
",686193,Waterfall Jr.," You can't own property, man!
",306194,Farnsworth," I can, but that's because I'm not a penniless hippie.
",556195,Leela,"  What do you people want?
",276196,Waterfall Jr.,"  We're with Mankind for Ethical Animal Treatment.  Popplers are living creatures. You gotta stop harvesting them for food!
",1246197,Bender,"  Or what?
",116198,Waterfall Jr.,"  Or we'll boycott Fishy Joe's.
",326199,Leela," You're vegetarians, who cares what you do?
",446200,Waterfall Jr.," Shut up.
",106201,Leela," Animals eat other animals. It's nature.
",416202,Waterfall Jr.," No, it isn't. We taught a lion to eat tofu.  The point is you shouldn't eat things that feel pain.
",1006203,Bender,"  OK, we won't eat you.
",246204,Leela," I'll go get some more bricks.
",316205,Leela," Fry, I wish you'd throw out these week-old Popplers. They're getting big and scaly. Ooh, there's one left.
",1086206,Poppler," Mama!
",76207,Leela," Stop! Stop eating Popplers!
",296208,Amy," Why?
",66209,Bender," My booze!
",116210,Leela," Popplers are intelligent. This one called me mama.
",526211,Zoidberg," Congratulations. I assume Amy is the father.
",466212,Bender," Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating from not eating enough Popplers. Here, eat some now.
",1036213,Leela," No!
",56214,Bender," I said ""eat""! Come on, mange!
",316215,Leela," Sorry, babies.
",166216,Amy," Leela, maybe you should lie down.
",356217,Zoidberg," Yes, listen to the father.
",286218,Leela," I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come on, little Poppler, say ""mama"".
",716219,Fry," Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?
",1236220,Bender," Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick, like Fry.
",676221,Fry,"  Like Fry! Like Fry!
",226222,Farnsworth," There's one way, and only one way, to determine if an animal is intelligent.  Dissect its brain!
",986223,Poppler," No, mama. Stop grandpa!
",256224,Farnsworth," Enough chit-chat. Restrain the specimen!
",426225,Man #1 #3," Mmm, good.
",126226,Woman #1 #3," Give me some of that special sauce.
",376227,Leela,"  Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!
",396228,Man #1 #4,"  Don't stop to talk! Eat Popplers!
",366229,Leela," Hey, cut it out!
",186230,Man #1 #4,"  Take a coupon, cut it out!  Ow! Ow!
",386231,Fry," People, I won't let you enter. Popplers are as intelligent as you or me.
",746232,Man #1 #5," You, maybe!
",136233,Bender," Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! Stop eating them with honey mustard sauce.  Stop eating them with tangy sweet-and-sour sauce. Stop eating the new fiesta Poppler salad. Stop taking advantage of the money-saving 12-pack.  Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio, in the car, or on the boat. Wherever good times are had!  Ow!
",3286234,Linda,"  Tonight on Datenight: Popplers. Eating them. Is it alright to? We have with us the CEO of Fishy Joe's, Mr. ""Fishy"" Joseph Gilman.  Noted anti-eating activist, Free Waterfall Jr.  And the discoverer of Popplers, Captain Turanga Leela.
",2366235,Fry," Turanga?
",106236,Amy," That's her name, Philip.
",266237,Bender," Philip?
",96238,Linda,"  Fishy Joe, is it wrong to eat intelligent animals?
",536239,Gilman,"  Absolutely not, Linda. I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.
",736240,Leela,"  I am.
",86241,Waterfall Jr.,"  Me too.
",106242,Gilman,"  Listen...
",126243,Waterfall Jr.,"  Shut up...
",136244,Gilman,"  ...we're talking about a snack...
",366245,Waterfall Jr.,"  ...shut up...
",166246,Gilman,"  ...that's low in fat...
",266247,Waterfall Jr.,"  ...shut up.
",146248,Gilman,"  ...and high in profit.
",256249,Waterfall Jr.,"  You're crazy, man. He is crazy.
",346250,Gilman,"  There's not even any strong evidence that these Popplers are intelligent.
",766251,Waterfall Jr.,"  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up...
",496252,Leela,"  That's not true. I have one right here that can talk.
",566253,Waterfall Jr.,"  ...shut up...
",166254,Leela,"  Come on, say ""mama"".
",236255,Poppler,"  Ca-ca!
",96256,Linda,"  OK, we'll have to bleep that.
",326257,Leela,"  Look, I'm not saying eating meat is wrong...
",476258,Waterfall Jr.,"  Shut up.
",116259,Leela,"  I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.
",506260,Waterfall Jr.,"  I am.
",86261,Leela,"  But eating an intelligent animal is different.
",496262,Waterfall Jr.,"  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up...
",496263,Gilman,"  Oh, don't force your tired philosophy on us. I mean, the only reason we don't eat people is because it tastes lousy.
",1196264,Waterfall Jr.,"  You're all nuts. Shut up, let me talk.
",416265,Linda,"  You shut up, please.
",236266,Waterfall Jr.,"  No, you shut up, please.
",276267,Gilman,"  Popplers are no smarter than any other animal I've served. And that includes cats.
",856268,Poppler,"  Ca-ca head. Mean, old ca-ca head.
",366269,Gilman,"  Sir, I'm making a point. If these gutter-mouthed creatures are so smart, why don't they defend themselves, huh?
",1146270,Leela,"  Stop it!
",116271,Waterfall Jr.,"  I call murder on that.
",256272,Gilman,"  Look, I'm willing to grant that it's murder. The real issue is: Who's gonna stop me?
",876273,Linda,"  We seem to be experiencing technical difficulties.  And, crap like I've never seen!
",866274,Lrrr,"  People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.  Turn down that TV, Nd-Nd.
",886275,Farnsworth," Dear Lord, they're back!
",266276,Amy," We're doomed!
",156277,Hermes," Doooomed!
",116278,Bender," Doooo...
",106279,Lrrr,"  Now then, the creatures you call ""Popplers"" come from a nursery planet in our sector.
",886280,Ndnd,"  You monsters have been eating our babies!
",446281,Leela," Eck!
",66282,Ndnd,"  We demand justice. As you ate our children, so shall you be eaten by us!
",756283,Lrrr,"  We will begin with the firemen, then the math teachers, and so on in that fashion until everyone is eaten.  Transmission over!  Well, that went OK. I tell you, when-when you know you can't scratch, that's when you really have to, huh?  Oh! Oh, yeah, that feels a lot better. What? It's still on?
",2986284,Zapp," As chief negotiator, I speak for all of Earth when I mourn the regrettable loss of the Omicronian young. We share your pain.  Mmm.  If we could undo the damage--  These would be great with quack-a-mole.
",2046285,Lrrr,"  Stop eating our young! And it's pronounced guacamole!
",566286,Zapp," Alright, I'm putting them away.  Now, uh, what is it you want?
",646287,Lrrr," We demand--  We demand to eat one human for each Omicronian that was eaten.
",776288,Zapp," Fair enough. How many is that?
",326289,Kif," 198 billion, sir.
",196290,Lrrr," Very well. You will provide us with 198 billion humans. And, uh, small fries.
",796291,Ndnd," Lrrr!
",76292,Lrrr," Oh, alright, cottage cheese!
",306293,Kif," Sir?  There aren't that many human beings.
",446294,Zapp," A thought occurs: There aren't that many humans.
",506295,Lrrr," We're willing to wait a few weeks while you shore up the numbers.
",676296,Zapp," Hmm. 198 billion babies in a few weeks. We'll need an army of super-virile men scoring round the clock! I'll do my part. Kif, clear my schedule.
",1466297,Fry," I wish they'd just wipe out humanity and get it over with. It's the waiting I can't stand.
",926298,Leela," That's stupid!
",166299,Zapp," My fellow Earthlings, we have reached an agreement. Using the twin guns of grace and tact, I blasted our worthless enemies with a fair compromise.  They will not eat everyone on Earth.
",1866300,Lrrr," I filled up on nuts at the negotiation.
",416301,Zapp," Instead, they will eat only a single human of their choice.
",616302,Lrrr," We choose to eat the first Earthling who ate our offspring.  Here is the culprit, as photographed by our nanny-cam satellite.  She must be sacrificed, but the rest of you shall be spared.
",1896303,Linda," Tonight, the world watches in horror as an earthling is eaten alive on network television. This grim scene of unimaginable carnage is brought to you by Fishy Joe's! Try our new Extreme Walrus Juice!  100% fresh-squeezed walrus. Ride the walrus!
",2466304,Announcer #1,"  Ladies and gentlemen. The Omicronians!
",416305,Lrrr," Greetings, Earth morsels.
",276306,Man #1 #6,"  You suck!
",126307,Lrrr," Get a job!
",126308,Bender," I'll miss you, Leela.  I know you're just a carbon-based life form but I'll always think of you as a big pile of titanium.
",1246309,Fry," What Bender means is, you're really brave, and smart, and beautiful, and a great friend.
",906310,Bender,"  Just like titanium!
",226311,Leela," This is all a big load. I was the one trying to save the Popplers.  You were sucking them down like the fat hog you are and you were stepping on them for fun.  You both should be in here instead of me.
",2036312,Bender,"  Someone's acting awfully aluminum.
",376313,Zapp," Leela, my sweet, I've come to save you. I have a devious plan!
",646314,Leela," Oh, great, Captain Moron has a plan. Why don't you tell it to Wingus and Dingus here?
",876315,Zapp," Wingus, Dingus, listen up. We're gonna give the aliens the old switcheroo!
",766316,Fry," You mean--
",126317,Zapp," Correct. I found a giant hideous ape that looks exactly like Leela.
",696318,Leela," It doesn't look anything like me. The hair is all wrong.
",586319,Zapp," Don't worry. Kif is an expert stylist, as you can plainly see.  Mmm!
",706320,Leela," You know, this might actually work. The Omicronians seem to have trouble telling one person from another.
",1076321,Zapp," True. At the negotiations, they thought Kif here was the statesman and I was a jabbering mental patient. Isn't that right, Kif?
",1296322,Kif," Please, I'm creating.  Voila!
",316323,Bender," Bingo!
",86324,Fry," That's Leela!
",156325,Zapp," I'm seeing double!
",206326,Lrrr," I grow hungry! Bring on the one called ""Leela"".
",496327,Waiter," That comes with salad or soup.
",326328,Lrrr," Uh, salad.
",126329,Waiter," Ranch or vinaigrette?
",236330,Lrrr," Vinaigrette!
",146331,Waiter," Balsamic or raspberry?
",246332,Woman #1 #4,"  What's going on here? It's very strange.
",436333,Zapp,"  People of Earth: Shh!
",246334,Woman #1 #4,"  Oh, I get it.
",166335,Woman #1 #5,"  I understand.
",166336,Lrrr," Hmm. Yes, this is one. Definitely. I recognise her slumping posture and hairy knuckles.
",896337,Ndnd,"  Would you like some human with your salt?
",446338,Linda," This is it. If the aliens fall for Zapp's ploy, the Earth will be saved. Brought to you by Fishy Joe's. Ride the walrus.
",1226339,Waterfall Jr.,"  Wait! Stop! It's a trick! That's not Leela.
",466340,Lrrr," W-What's happening? I'm losing the crowd.
",436341,Waterfall Jr.," It's an orang-utan. One of Mother Earth's most precious creatures.
",686342,Zapp," Why'd you open your bong hole, you smelly hippie? You'd sacrifice a beautiful woman to save a moderately-attractive monkey? You must've smoked some bad granola.
",1626343,Lrrr," The one called ""Smelly Hippie"" is right. This is a monkey!
",606344,Ndnd," Yes. Definitely.
",186345,Lrrr," Where is the real female?
",276346,Zapp," I'll never tell.
",186347,Lrrr," Where is the real female?
",276348,Zapp," I'll get her for you.
",236349,Zapp," I realise this may hurt our chances of consummating our relationship again.
",776350,Leela," Go consummate yourself.
",256351,Lrrr," Stop talking, you're getting cold.
",366352,Leela," Please! I just paid off my car!
",336353,Fry," No!
",56354,Bender," I can't look!
",156355,Poppler," Stop!  People of Earth. I am Jrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8. Could someone lower this thing for me?  Now then, if Leela gets eaten, I get eaten.
",1516356,Ndnd," Little one, get out of there. I'm going to count to blorx!
",606357,Jrrr," But, elder one--
",186358,Ndnd," Flingle ... glorg ... glorg and a gloob.
",426359,Jrrr," Hear me out. There are many good reasons to eat: Hunger, boredom, wanting to be the world's fattest man. But not revenge. Are we no better than they? Besides, Leela's my friend.
",1796360,Lrrr,"  Is this true, Earthling?
",276361,Leela,"  Yeah, it is.
",156362,Lrrr," Leela's garbled words have opened my eyes.
",446363,Waterfall Jr.," OK, that's a start, that's very Earth-friendly. Now everyone join hands. Join hands, please. I'd like to lead you all in some swaying. Come on, pay attention.  I said do it! Yeah...
",1836364,Lrrr," Is he your friend too?
",246365,Jrrr," No.
",56366,Waterfall Jr.," This is not happening.
",246367,Lrrr," I think there was something funny in that hippie.
",516368,Leela," Thank you, Jrrr.  I hope you'll always think of me as your mom.
",656369,Jrrr," When my species grows up, we eat our moms!
",446370,Leela," Whoop!
",86371,Lrrr," People of Earth-- Oh, that hippie's starting to kick in. we've all learned a valuable lesson today. I realise now that--  Dude! My hand are huge!  They can touch anything but themselves.  Oh, wait.
",1996372,Ndnd," Let's go.
",116373,Lrrr,"  Whoa!
",86374,Lrrr,"  Whoa, I feel like I'm flying!
",326375,Farnsworth," A toast to Leela. She showed us it's wrong to eat certain things.
",676376,Fry," Hear, hear!
",136377,Bender," Let's get drunk!
",186378,Leela," Aww, thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please.
",436379,Bender," Here you go.
",146380,Fry," Mmm, let me get some of that suckling pig.
",446381,Bender," Who wants dolphin?
",206382,Leela," Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent.
",406383,Bender," Not this one. He blew all his money on instant lottery tickets.
",656384,Fry," OK.
",56385,Leela," Oh, OK.
",96386,Amy," That's different.
",196387,Farnsworth," Good, good.
",136388,Leela," Pass the blowhole.
",206389,Amy," Can I have a fluke?
",216390,Hermes," Hey, quit hogging the bottle-nose.
",366391,Farnsworth," Toss me the speech centre of the brain!
",416392,Dial L for Leela, Ken Keeler,116393,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I've invented a device that allows you to operate equipment from great distances. I call it ""the fing-longer"".  Observe.  And, here we go.  There!
",1696394,Fry," Ooh!
",66395,Amy," Wow!
",66396,Zoidberg," Ah!
",56397,Farnsworth," Pretty long, eh?
",186398,Fry," Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?
",646399,Farnsworth," Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If question and it generates a video simulation of what would happen.
",1386400,Fry," Does it really work?
",226401,Farnsworth," Of course it works!  It's just not very long.
",476402,Bender," Ooh! Ooh!  I wanna aks it a question!  As a robot living among humans, I've never really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I've always secretly wondered: What if I was 500-feet tall?
",1956403,Zoidberg," Let's watch, shall we?
",246404,Bender," My work here is done!
",236405,Fry," I'm so lonely since I came to the future.  Will you be my friend?  Ow!  Who are you?
",866406,Bender," I'm a big robot and I want a big cereal!
",426407,Fry," You too? Will you be my friend?
",336408,Bender," Put it there, pal!  I meant your wallet.
",426409,Bender," Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes.  Hey!   Aw, quit it! Come on!
",646410,Fry,"  Stop! The robot's not your enemy! He's just a poor, misunderstood--
",706411,Zapp," Uh--
",66412,Amy," Well, there goes the neighbourhood.  There goes another neighbourhood.
",726413,Hermes," We're jerked! Nothing can stop a monster that big.
",526414,Farnsworth," Nothing except and even equally big monster. This is chance to try out my experimental enlarging ray. But we'll need a guinea pig.
",1326415,Zoidberg," What's this? Two meals in one week?
",376416,Farnsworth," Gotcha!
",96417,Hermes," Oh, yes!
",106418,Zoidberg," Friends! Help! A guinea pig tricked me!  What?
",486419,Zoidberg," So, now Zoidberg is big, huh? That's more like it! Who's intimidating who now, big city?  Hello, Mr. Chase Manhattan Bank. Deny my credit card application, will you?  Ah, the famed Apollo Theater. ""Boo"" me off stage on open-mic night, huh? I'll show you!
",2566420,Bender," Hey, I called this city! Quit touching my stuff!
",506421,Zoidberg," Tell it to claw.
",186422,Bender," Bite my colossal metal ass!
",296423,Zoidberg," Stop!
",76424,Bender,"  Who wants lobster bisque?
",286425,Zoidberg," Hmm?
",66426,Fry," Hey, Bender?
",146427,Bender," Huh?
",66428,Fry," Wanna make Shrinky Dinks?
",276429,Bender," Who put this in here?
",236430,Fry,"  Nooo!   Are you people satisfied? This gentle visitor is dying! And we'll never even know why he came.
",1056431,Bender," I'll tell you ... with my final breath.   I came here with a simple dream: A dream of killing all humans. And this is how it must end? Who's the real 7-billion-ton robot monster here? Not I.  Not I.
",2006432,Fry," Goodnight, sweet prince.
",266433,Narrator,"  Interesting stuff. Stay tuned for more Tales of Interest!
",606434,Farnsworth," Well, Leela, care to give the What-If machine a whirl?
",566435,Leela," Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about.
",566436,Hermes," Come on, woman! Just pick something.
",386437,Fry," Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this.
",376438,Bender," Go, man! Go!
",146439,Leela," I can be really impulsive. It just takes me a while.  Alright, Professor! Let's do it. Make that machine show me what would happen if I was a little more impulsive. Just a little.  Not too much.
",1966440,Leela," Hey, you guys, look what I bought on a wild impulse: New boots. They're like my old ones but with a crazy green stripe. Woo! Never know what I'm gonna do next!
",1616441,Farnsworth," Leela, could you come in here for a moment. I have something important to tell you.
",856442,Farnsworth," I can't live forever and I need an heir. Someone to spend my vast riches and take care of my man-eating anteaters when I'm gone.  The others simply aren't level-headed enough. They're too impulsive. Not like you. Not like old, predictable, dull-as-dishwater Leela.
",2666443,Leela," Hello? New boots!
",196444,Farnsworth," That's why I've made you my sole heir. The day I die, you'll be a very wealthy woman. Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy. The day I die. Because you're so unimpulsive.
",1666445,Leela," Yah!
",66446,Farnsworth,"  Ooh!  Oh, you've killed me! You've killed me!
",486447,Leela," Oh, God! What have I done?
",286448,Farnsworth," I just told you, you've killed me!
",366449,Leela," OK, just try to be nonchalant.
",326450,Zoidberg," Alright, so you're nonchalant. Quit rubbing our noses in it.
",626451,Hermes," Sweet giant anteater of Saint Anita! The Professor's been eaten by giant anteaters!
",856452,Zoidberg," What?
",76453,Hermes," If y'ask me, it's mighty suspicious! I'm gonna call the police ... right after I flush some things.
",1016454,Zoidberg," Police? Bah! Nosy meddlers! It so happens I have mail order degrees in Murderology and Murderonomy.  Zoidberg is afoot!
",1216455,Hermes," Perhaps the Professor's files can clear things up.  ""Citation for public nudity"", ""Conspiracy to commit public nudity"".  Aha! A new will! Naming ...  ... you as his sole heir.
",1776456,Leela," That doesn't prove I killed him.
",346457,Hermes," It's a video will. It shows you killing him.
",466458,Leela,"  Hi-yah!
",106459,Zoidberg," Alright, anteater number one, who are you protecting?  Is it anteater number two?  Don't stick your tongue out at me. I need a name!  What? How do you spell that?
",1646460,Hermes,"  What are you hacking off? Is it my torso? It is! My precious torso!
",706461,Zoidberg,"  Hermes, quiet! I'm deducing things.
",386462,Bender," Whattya got? Disposal trouble?
",326463,Leela," No! Everything's just--
",256464,Bender," Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?.  And now Hermes is mysteriously missing. Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm?  Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the trash!
",2556465,Leela," I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered Hermes?
",776466,Bender," Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as you let Bender wet his beak.
",1006467,Leela," You're blackmailing me?
",256468,Bender," ""Blackmail"" is such an ugly word. I prefer ""extortion"". The ""X"" makes it sound cool.  Please, honey, I'm made of metal. Like you're really gonna hurt me with a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?
",2086469,Leela," OK, that's it. No more killing! Next time you feel like killing just have a stick of gum.  Now to dispose of the body.
",1206470,Amy," Wow! Sporty go-cart, Leela! So hip and sexy. Not like you at all.
",676471,Leela," Do you have any gum?
",226472,Amy," No.
",56473,Zoidberg," Ah, the gang's all here.
",266474,Leela," Who are you?
",146475,Scruffy," Scruffy, the janitor.
",236476,Leela," I've never seen you before.
",296477,Scruffy," I've never seen you before neither.
",376478,Zoidberg," Quiet, please. I've called you all here to the parlour to watch as I gradually solve the crime. One of the people in this room ... is a big murderer!  You see, the killer left one fatal clue: This boot print on the Professor's lab coat.
",2386479,Leela," Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots.  See?
",476480,Fry," Ew! What smells like boot feet?
",336481,Cubert," This is preposterous. Obviously, the murderer is--
",526482,Zoidberg," My next clue came at 4.15, when the clock stopped. And another came two hours later at 4.15, when I discovered the murdered body of Amy's dead, deceased corpse.
",1626483,Scruffy," Scruffy knows who killed them people. In Scruffy's opinion, it were--
",716484,Zoidberg," So, it's just as I suspected all along. The crime is unsolvable!  A letter from Bender, my good friend.  Dear Dr. Jerkberg, if you're reading this, I'm already dead. The person who killed me was ... was--  My God! It can't be! The murderer, it was--
",2516485,Fry," I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV.
",606486,Leela," Could you get the lights on your way out?
",436487,Fry," Whatcha eating?
",176488,Leela,"  Lobster. Want some?
",226489,Fry," Sure.  Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious deaths.
",896490,Leela," Really?
",96491,Fry," Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?
",506492,Leela," No.
",56493,Fry," No?
",56494,Leela," No!
",56495,Fry," Then ... then ... it was you!
",316496,Leela,"  I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse. Then I had to kill another. And another.
",1076497,Fry," Well, that covers the first three killings.
",456498,Leela," And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive!
",886499,Leela," So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?
",536500,Fry," I like it!
",126501,Leela," Good. Now let me just get the lights.
",396502,Fry," I really like it!
",196503,Farnsworth," Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Fry?
",646504,Fry," Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?
",576505,Leela," You idiot! We already saw that.
",336506,Fry," I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.
",436507,Farnsworth," We're not seeing it again! Ask something less stupid.
",556508,Fry," Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came to the future-jiggy?
",1066509,Farnsworth," That question is less stupid, though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way.  What would happen if Fry never came to the future?
",1316510,Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!  Here's to another lousy Millennium!  Ow!  I should have left you floating in the toilet!
",1436511,Leela," What is it?
",136512,Farnsworth," It appears that the very fabric of space-time has ripped.
",596513,Bender," Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!
",376514,Fry," Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?
",496515,Zoidberg," If that's his pizza, then I'm icy whatever!
",456516,Fry," You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?
",566517,Panucci," There's only three real monsters, kid: Dracula, Blacula and Son of Kong. Now quit picking your nose and knead that dough!  Hey! The usual, Professor Hawking?
",1596518,Stephen Hawking," No. Today I'd like something good.
",366519,Panucci," Hawking, you're alright! I'll make you the usual!
",516520,Fry," Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?
",726521,Hawking," Sure. Why not?
",166522,Fry," Let me ask you something: Has anyone ever discovered a hole in nothing with monsters in it?  'Cause if I'm the first, I want them to call it ""a Fry Hole"".
",1566523,Hawking," There is nothing to be concerned about. I must go. There is much to do.
",736524,Panucci," Hey, Hawking! Your pizza's ready.
",356525,Hawking," Toss it in the garbage!
",256526,Hawking,"  There he is. Seize him.
",266527,Fry,"  Who said that?  Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!
",486528,Fry," Who are you people?
",216529,Gore," I'm Al Gore, and these are my Vice Presidential Action Rangers; a group of top nerds whose sole duty it is to prevent disruptions in the space-time continuum.
",1606530,Fry," I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
",706531,Gore," That, and protect the space-time continuum. Read the Constitution!
",686532,Fry," Hmm. So I guess you'll wanna see my Fry Hole.
",476533,Gore," Very much so. But first, meet the Action Rangers. You already know Stephen Hawking. Also with us are Nichelle Nichols, a.k.a. Commander Uhura.
",1446534,Nichols," Incoming transmission from MCI ""One Rate"" department. It sounds like a limited-time offer.
",926535,Gore," Tell them I'm in the tub! To my left you'll recognise Gary Gygax, inventor of Dungeons & Dragons.
",996536,Gygax," Greetings! It's a ...  ... pleasure to meet you!
",506537,Gore," And our summer intern, Deep Blue, the world's foremost chess-playing computer.
",806538,Deep Blue," Bishop to knight 4.
",216539,Gore," Not all missions can be solved with chess, Deep Blue. Someday you'll understand that.
",876540,Fry," Where am I, anyway?
",216541,Nichols," You're travelling in a specially-equipped terrestrial transport module.
",736542,Gygax," A school bus!
",156543,Fry," So what do you nerds want?
",286544,Nichols," It's about that rip in space-time that you saw.
",496545,Hawking," I call it a ""Hawking Hole"".
",296546,Fry," No fair! I saw it first!
",266547,Hawking," Who is The Journal of Quantum Physics going to believe?
",576548,Gygax," Mr. Fry, the time disruption indicates that some of that was supposed to happen but didn't, due to a quantum fluctuation.
",1236549,Nichols," That's why we had to beat you with tennis rackets.
",526550,Gore," If we don't go back there and make the event happen, the entire universe will be destroyed! And as an environmentalist, I'm against that.
",1396551,Fry," So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.
",746552,Hawking," I call it a ""Hawking Chamber"".
",326553,Fry," But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head.
",766554,Gore," Well it's obvious what should have happened: That wang to the head should have killed you.
",926555,Fry," Uh, what?
",116556,Nichols," Let's finish the job.
",236557,Gore," No! Wait! There must be a peaceful--
",386558,Hawking," Hold him down.
",166559,Deep Blue," Check.
",86560,Fry," Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
",176561,Nichols," Something's wrong. Murder isn't working and that's all we're good at.
",716562,Gygax," Let's try something else. Maybe we should--
",456563,Gore," Put the dice away before I take them away.
",446564,Nichols," Wait. I'm getting an idea. What if Fry was supposed to get frozen?
",686565,Hawking," Yes. Shove him in the tube. It was my idea.
",456566,Bender," Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!
",586567,Gore," Get in the tube, dummy! We only have a few seconds before the universe is destroyed.
",866568,Fry," Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up.
",746569,Gygax," Here. Take my plus-one mace.
",306570,Fry," OK, here I go.
",166571,Gore," You fool! You foolish fool!
",296572,Fry," Eh, what's the worst thing that can happen?
",456573,Hawking," Great. The entire universe was destroyed.
",436574,Fry," Destroyed? Then where are we now?
",356575,Gore," I don't know. But I can darn well tell you where we're not: The universe.
",756576,Nichols," Eternity with nerds. It's the Pasadena Star Trek convention all over again.
",776577,Gygax," Anyone wanna play Dungeons & Dragons for the next quadrillion years?
",706578,Fry," Sure.
",76579,Hawking," I guess.
",106580,Deep Blue," Pawn to rook 8.
",176581,Gore," I'm a 10th-level Vice President!
",346582,Farnsworth," That story was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria! This thing isn't worth the gold it's made of.  Anyway, the fing-longer seems to be arousing success.
",1626583,Fry," Good work.
",126584,Leela," Congratulations!
",186585,Amy," Right on, Professor!
",226586,Farnsworth," So that's what things would be like if I'd invented the fing-longer.  A man can dream though. A man can dream.
",1126587,Fry," Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum ... ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with the breath-freshening power of ham.
",1086588,Bender," And it pinkens your teeth while you chew.
",436589,Clerk," Alright, sergeant, $100 worth of pixie stix and porno mags with your 5% military discount comes to $95.  That'll be 40 cents.
",1276590,Fry," I believe you're forgetting about our 5% military discount.
",616591,Clerk," Well that's only for people in the military.
",466592,Bender," What? This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!
",706593,Clerk," Alright, look. Our policy is: If for any reason you're not completely satisfied, I hate you.
",946594,Bender," OK, now I'm mad!
",186595,Fry," Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, monsignor.
",536596,Bender," Hello. We're here because we, uh, love our planet!
",526597,Recruitment Officer," Sign here on the dotted line, patriots, and I'll give you your discount cards.
",806598,Fry," Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately quit the army, right?
",986599,Bender," You know, playing you all for chumps?
",396600,Recruitment Officer," Correct. There's no obligation.  Unless, of course, war were declared.
",726601,Fry," What's that?
",146602,Recruitment Officer," War were declared.
",206603,Farnsworth," Now be careful, Fry. And if you kill anyone, make sure to eat their heart, to gain their courage. Their rich, tasty courage.
",1266604,Hermes," I don't want you to worry about your jobs while you're away. That's why I'm firing you now.
",936605,Leela," I wanna enlist. My friends always die if I'm not there to save them.
",706606,Zapp," Sorry, but the army's instituted a men-only policy.
",536607,Leela," What?
",76608,Zapp," It's shameful, I agree. In the olden days, I proudly fought alongside female troops, shoulder to, uh, shoulder. Alas, after a series of deadly blunders caused by distracting low-cut fatigues and lots of harmless pinching, the army decided women weren't fit for service. Not when I'm in charge.
",2956609,Leela," You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson.
",546610,Zapp," If it's a lesson in love, watch out; I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. What do I call it, Kif?
",1096611,Kif," ""Sex-lexia"".
",146612,Zapp," Men, you're lucky men. Soon you'll all be fighting for your planet. Many of you will be dying for your planet. A few of you will be forced through a fine mesh screen for your planet. They will be the luckiest of all.
",2186613,Bender," Great, we're gonna die.
",256614,Fry," And this ham gum is all bones.
",326615,Zapp," Now to present the logistics of our mission, the Commander-in-Chief. Please welcome the original Gerber Baby, Earth President Richard M. Nixon.
",1456616,Nixon," This is the brass ring, fellas.  Planet Spheron One!
",546617,Fry," Cool effect!
",146618,Zapp," It's a desolate, ugly little planet with absolutely no natural resources or strategic value. Questions?
",1056619,Soldier #1 #1," Why is this Godforsaken planet worth dying for?
",496620,Zapp," Don't ask me, you're the one who's going to be dying.
",556621,Fry," Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?
",426622,Zapp," A valid question.  We know nothing about their language, their history or what they look like. But we can assume this: They stand for everything we don't stand for. Also, they told me you guys look like dorks.
",2116623,Bender," They look like dorks!
",236624,Zapp," What's the matter, private? Tent got your tongue?  Tent got your...  Kif, write that down and send it to ""Humor In Uniform"".
",1266625,Fry," Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales!
",806626,Kif," That new recruit is phenomenal, sir.
",386627,Zapp," Yes. He edged out my old mark by two seconds ...  ... and 16 minutes ... and 12 hours. I do plan to finish someday, Kif. Good hustle, soldier.
",1446628,Leela,"  Uh, sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode. You know how testosterone is.
",766629,Zapp," As a bubbling Crock-Pot of male hormones, I sure do. What's your name, private?
",816630,Leela,"  Lee--  La ... man. La Man ... Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir.
",556631,Zapp," Lemon, you're a man's man. You're a man's man's man. More importantly, your hand, while firm and masculine, is soft as a velvet child. What lotion do you use?
",1606632,Leela,"  Pert and Popular, sir.
",256633,Zapp," Roger that. Kif, get me ten cases of Pert and Popular.
",566634,Kif," What shall I do with your Jergens, sir?
",416635,Zapp," Squirt it on some homeless man with dry elbows.  Private Lee Lemon may well be the finest recruit I've seen in all my years of service. That young man fills me with hope and some other emotions that are weird and deeply confusing to me.
",2386636,Kif," Ew!
",56637,Zapp,"  Hello!
",96638,Nixon," Mmm! Now that's a nice rosÃ©. So, anyway, we open up the panda crate and, wouldn't you know it, the damn thing's dead! Up-chucked it's bamboo. True story.
",1556639,Zapp," Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's whatever you were talking about for you.
",656640,Fry," Mind if we sit with you?
",266641,Leela,"  Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys.
",816642,Fry," Good point ... I guess.
",256643,Bender," You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle.
",1016644,Hick," So. Any you fellas got a special lady back home?
",506645,Fry," Well, I sort of a have a thing for this girl I work with.
",596646,Leela," Really?  What type is she? You know, blonde, or Chinese, or Cyclops?
",706647,Fry," Cyclops.
",106648,Leela,"  Aww, she sounds sweet.
",256649,Bender," But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, ugly son of a--
",926650,Leela,"  Stop! Stop flattering me!
",286651,Zapp,"  Ten hut!  Well, well, well. If it isn't Lee Lemon: The flaming star of Brannigan's Rough Rangers. Say, uh, Lemon, do you like to read? I just got a great book on tape. It's about life in Ancient Greece and--
",2106652,Leela,"  Sir, the alarm. I think I'd better--
",396653,Zapp," Shh. Don't talk. Just go.
",276654,Nixon," We are now in position above Spheron One. This is the moment we were training for all yesterday afternoon.
",1086655,Zapp," And now for the battle plan: As you all know, the key to victory is the element of surprise. Surprise!
",1046656,Fry," It's creepy here.
",196657,Soldier #1 #1," This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
",536658,Fry," And then the battle's not so bad?
",356659,Soldier #1 #1," Oh, right. I forgot about the battle.
",396660,Fry," What's happening?
",196661,Hick," Holy shoot! Lookie!
",216662,Fry," The enemy! They're balls!
",276663,Leela," Charge your gun, Fry.
",236664,Fry," Oh, right.
",126665,Zapp," Watch where you're shooting, private! You spooked Felicity.  There, there, boy.
",816666,Soldier #1 #1,"  Give this to my son.
",236667,Bender," You got it!
",136668,Soldier #1 #1,"  Wait. I didn't tell you where he lives.
",426669,Bender," Hey, I think your son might also like those boots.
",526670,Hick," Cover us, buddy. You've got the only wounded-up positron shooter.  Fry, you emu-bellied coward!
",976671,Fry,"  Bender! No!
",146672,Bender," If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender.
",636673,P.A. Announcer #1,"  Incoming wounded. All operating personnel report to tent four, repeat, four-- I mean five! Repeat, four.
",1076674,Nurse," Are you ready to operate, doctor?
",356675,Zoidberg,"  I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery.  I kid! I kid!
",676676,Zoidberg," Scalpel.  Blood bucket.  Priest. Next patient.
",486677,iHawk," Gee, Zoidberg, leave some for the enemy to kill.
",506678,Nurse," Leave Dr. Zoidberg alone! He has twice the training you do.
",616679,iHawk," Yeah, he's a doctor and a butcher!
",366680,Zoidberg," See, this is how it starts. First with he jokes, then comes the heavy stuff.
",786681,iHawk," When will the killing end?
",286682,Zapp," Look at this sissy, Kif. While others were fighting and dying pointlessly, he was hiding in a hole, wallowing in a pool of his own cowardice.
",1436683,Fry," That wasn't cowardice.
",246684,Zapp," I'm de-promoting you, soldier. Kif, what's the most humiliating job there is?
",796685,Kif," Being your assistant.
",236686,Zapp," Wrong! Being your assistant! Private Fry, you shall henceforth serve as Kif's assistant.
",906687,Fry," That doesn't sound too bad.
",296688,Kif," You speak when I tell you to, you filthy worm!
",486689,Zoidberg," I'm afraid he's gone.
",236690,Hick," Whoa, doc, I ain't dead.
",266691,Zoidberg," Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor.
",386692,iHawk," Believe it all you want, that won't make it true.  This isn't a war, it's a murder.  This isn't a war, it's a moider!
",1196693,Hick," Bender, old buddy, hang in there.
",356694,Zapp," Here lies the bravest soldier I've seen since my mirror got grease on it. I hereby order that in Bender's honour he be melted down and made into a statue of himself.
",1676695,Nixon," Slow down there, Starsky, I'm up to something here. I want this robot fixed. Fixed like Kennedy fixed the 1960 election. Damn bean-eating war hero!
",1496696,Nurse," Are you read to operate, doctor?
",346697,iHawk," I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery.
",516698,Zoidberg," That's my joke! I'll kill you!
",326699,Zapp," Ah! Pre-war scotch!  Welcome, Lieutenant Bender. You're looking sharp.
",726700,Bender," I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers.
",406701,Zapp," Damnit, Kif, where's the little umbrella? That's what makes it a scotch-on-the-rocks!
",876702,Kif," Actually, sir--
",176703,Zapp," Make me a new one.
",206704,Kif," Use a brush, you dunderhead! And mix these mixed nuts. I see two almonds touching!
",846705,Nixon," Now, listen here, Bender. This war is in danger of going all quagmire on me, so I'm sending you on one last mission.
",1186706,Bender," Hot diggidy daffodil!
",236707,Nixon," A mission of peace.
",216708,Bender,"  Oh!
",66709,Zapp," You'll be negotiating with the aliens' mysterious leaders, the Brain Balls. They've got a lot of brains and they've got a lot of kutzpa!
",1386710,Nixon," Accompanying you will be our top peace negotiator, Henry Kissenger.
",696711,Kissenger," How are you?
",146712,Bender," Is he any good?
",176713,Nixon," Looking like that, he talked his way into Jill St. John's bed. Nuff said!
",756714,Nixon,"  I'm so dizzy,
My head is spinning,
Like a whirlpool,
It never ends.
",706715,Zapp," A little lower. Lower. Lower. A lot lower. Too low! ... Lower!
",646716,Fry,"  I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh.
",366717,Zapp," Private Lemon, no need to leave.   My stall just became free.
",636718,Leela,"  Maybe you should put on a towel, sir.
",406719,Zapp," Right! Right!  I'm about to try the new lotion you recommended.  If I should accidentally put too much on my hands, perhaps I could rub it onto you.
",1506720,Nixon," Brannigan!
",126721,Zapp," Hm?
",56722,Nixon," My God, cover yourself. I didn't live a thousand years and travel a quadrillion miles to look at another man's gizmo.
",1196723,Zapp," Uh, sorry, Mr. President, I-I didn't realise. Kif, raise him up about nipple-high.
",846724,Nixon," Come on, Brannigan, stuff yourself into a uniform. We've gotta get off this planet before the bomb goes off.
",1106725,Leela,"  Bomb? What bomb?
",196726,Zapp," The one we had the doctors implant in that gullible Bender robot.
",676727,Nixon," Zapp. Zapp!
",136728,Zapp," Hm?
",56729,Nixon," Inspect the troops later. It's time to activate the bomb.
",596730,Kissenger," Now, as for economic co-operation--
",376731,Bender," Whoa! Scuse me.
",176732,P.A. Announcer #1,"  Attention: All personnel evacuate the planet immediately. And not just because it's meat loaf night.
",1036733,Zapp," Come along, Lemon, before this whole dump blows up.
",536734,Leela,"  Uh, Commander? Could you tell me when the bomb is exploding?
",636735,Zapp," Of course, my significant soldier. The bomb is voice-activated. It will detonate the instant the robot unwittingly speaks a certain word.
",1396736,Fry," What's the word, uh, sir?
",276737,Zapp," It's the one word the robot uses more than any other. We got it from this convenient database of his 10 most frequently-used words.  Number 10, chump; number nine, chumpette; number eight, yours; number seven, up; number six, pimpmobile; number five, bite; number four, my ...  ... number three, shiny; number two, daffodil. And Bender's number one most frequently-uttered word, the word which, if uttered, will blow up this entire planet: Ass.
",4466738,Fry," We don't have long!
",216739,Brain Ball #1," We demand bouncing, followed by rolling, followed by rolling of the third type.
",816740,Kissenger," Say what?
",116741,Bender," My chair's too hard. It's a real pain in the, uh, whattya call it? Lower back! Yeah, that whole region.
",1056742,Fry," OK, I gotta break down that gate, beat up those three guards, steal that chopper and rescue Bender.
",1016743,Leela," Hi-yah!
",96744,Fry," Hey, I did it! Wait, that's not me.
",376745,Leela,"  Come on! We gotta save Bender.
",336746,Fry," You wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely know him.
",536747,Leela," Fry, don't you recognise me?
",306748,Fry,"  Hermes?
",106749,Zapp," Lee? When will I see you again?  The two of you are good friends? But I thought we would be good friends.  Well, let's see how friendly you get when you're sharing a prison cell!
",1806750,Leela," Hey, Zapp!
",126751,Zapp," Leela!
",86752,Fry," Leela!
",86753,Zapp," So it's you I've been attracted to! Oh, God, I've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman.
",996754,Leela," Let's do it again sometime.
",296755,Brain Ball #2," The Elders tell of a young ball much like you. He bounced three metres in the air. Then he bounced 1.8 metres in the air. Then he bounced four metres in the air. Do I make myself clear?
",1876756,Kissenger," Mr. Ambassador, our people tell the same story. Oy.
",536757,Bender," These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their-- Wait a second. Where do you shove things up a ball?
",1756758,Kissenger," This isn't a productive area of discussion.
",456759,Leela," We're here. I followed the bouncing balls.  I'll keep the chopper at a safe altitude while you parachute down.
",1126760,Fry," OK, my best friend's life is at stake. I can finally prove that I'm not a coward.  Will you push me?
",1026761,Leela,"  I already did!
",176762,Fry,"  Thank you!  At last, war has made me into a man.
",516763,Kissenger," Please, gentlemen, we must put an end to the bloodshed. We have all seen too many body bags and ball sacks.
",1096764,Brain Ball #1," We cannot condone bouncing of the seventh variety.
",526765,Bender," Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But before I go I have one thing to say.  Bite my shiny metal--
",1316766,Fry," Stop! You can't say the next word.
",366767,Bender," Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch.
",526768,Fry," Bender, if you say the A-word, you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word!
",806769,Kissenger," Young man, you have the bravery of a hero and breath as fresh as a summer ham.  What? What is funny?
",1026770,Bender," Bender's got the upper hand now.  The name of the game is ""Make Bender Happy Or He Blows Up The Planet"".  I'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!
",2266771,Brain Ball #1," Please, stay calm. There's no need to bounce of the handle.
",616772,Bender," That's it, I'm saying it! ""A"" is for--
",406773,Brain Ball #1," Wait, stop! We give in to all of Earth's demands. The war is over. Our home planet is yours.
",946774,Fry," Alright! Hey, wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading aliens?
",896775,Brain Ball #2," Correct.
",106776,Bender," Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson: Don't mess with Earth.
",686777,Brain Ball #1," May you bounce in peace.
",266778,Bender," Get the hell off my planet.
",296779,Farnsworth," Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him.  Wake up!
",506780,Bender," Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying the word I love to say?
",1036781,Zoidberg," I'm sorry but we couldn't remove it.
",386782,Farnsworth," It's stuck in there with glue or something, I don't know.
",596783,Bender,"  Well, this is just great! What's the point of living if I can't say ""ass""?  Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!
",1596784,Leela," We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it.
",686785,Amy," It's from the list of words you almost never say.
",516786,Bender," That's using your ass. So, what's the word?
",456787,Hermes," We think it's better if you don't know.
",416788,Bender," Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Ooh, is it ""please""?
",656789,Fry," No.
",56790,Bender," Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! ""Thanks""!
",466791,Leela," Bender, stop trying to destroy the world.
",436792,Bender," Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it ""sorry""? No. ""Fun-derful""? Uh, ""non-alcoholic""?
",796793,Amy," Quit it!
",106794,Fry," Bender!
",96795,Hermes," Stop it, mon!
",156796,Zoidberg," Enough already!
",176797,Bender,"  ""Compassion""? ""Shrimptoast""? ""Antiquing""?  I'm alright!
",586798,Doctorbot," Notify his survivors.
",236799,Bender,"  B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender!  B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! Sayin' B-E-N-D-ER--
",696800,Hermes," Mail call! Amy, here's your designer lingerie catalogue. Fry, Sadie's Bra Parade and, Leela, Bulk Underpants Outlet.
",1186801,Leela," You buy one pound of underwear and you're on their list forever.
",666802,Hermes," And for Bender-- Uh-oh! A black-bordered envelope.
",526803,Amy," Oh, no! Someone you know must've died.
",406804,Bender," I hope it was one of my enemies; those guys suck!  Oh, no! My uncle Vladimir.
",796805,Fry," Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?
",446806,Bender," Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will.  Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always hated!  C'mon, it'll be fun!
",1506807,Bender," Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton. Could you take us to yon castle?
",686808,Robot #1 #1," Some say unholy things happen up there.
",416809,Robot #1 #2," For example: All of us say that.
",346810,Farnsworth," Fuf! Superstitious robot mumbo-jumbo.
",396811,Robot #1 #2," Mumbo, perhaps. Jumbo, perhaps not! With all your modern science are you any closer to understanding the mystery of how a robot walks or talks?
",1456812,Farnsworth," Yes, you idiot.  The circuit diagram is right here on the inside of your case.
",806813,Robot #1 #2," I choose to believe what I was programmed to believe.
",556814,Robot #1 #2," I will go this far and no further.
",366815,Preacherbot," I now commend Vladimir's remains to the earth. Filings to filings; rust to rust.
",826816,Execu-Tor,"  To my loyal butler, You There, for his decades of service, I leave a pittance, to be paid in 20 equal instalments of one-twentieth of a pittance each.  To my lazy, spoiled son, Tandy, who never learned the value of a dollar, I leave my entire $10 million fortune.
",2666817,Tandy,"  Is that a lot?
",176818,Execu-Tor,"  And to my loving nephew, Bender, assuming he's not responsible for my death, I leave my castle.
",986819,Bender," Yes! Let's stay there tonight.
",326820,Execu-Tor,"  On condition that he spend one night within its walls.
",576821,Bender," Oh, man, there's always a catch!
",346822,Bender," Ah! I got a good vibe from this place: Nice long dinner table, quiet, well-behaved spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It's gonna be--
",1346823,Leela," What is it?
",136824,Bender," That painting, the eyes are watching me!
",426825,Farnsworth," Hmm.  It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors.
",626826,Bender," So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although--  What's that?
",886827,Zoidberg," I don't know, but it's infectious!
",366828,Bender," No doubt about it, this place is haunted.
",436829,Hermes," Don't be silly, mon. The last ghost died over 200 years ago.
",626830,Bender," The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?
",416831,Leela,"  0101100101.  What does it mean?
",346832,Bender," It's just gibberish.   1010011010?
",366833,Bender," Uncle Vladimir!
",176834,Vladimir-Ghost," Come, Bender. You'll like being dead!
",396835,Bender," That's what they said about being alive.
",426836,Robot #1 Ghosts,"  Join us! Join us! Join us, Bender!
",376837,Farnsworth," Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly-shielded coffins. Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old, abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms.
",2126838,Hermes," Of course! It was so obvious!
",316839,Farnsworth," Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense. We really should tell Bender there's nothing to be afraid of.
",1186840,Bender,"  Nooo!
",86841,Fry," Bender, wake up!  He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?
",646842,Leela," Bender, what happened?
",246843,Bender," Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!
",1276844,Fry," Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or too little, I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly the right amount.
",1666845,Amy," Maybe he has. Look at these tracks.
",376846,Leela," I think Bender may be telling the truth.
",426847,Zoidberg," Bender, you look awful. I prescribe make-up. Here. It just so happens I have my Mary Kay sample case!
",1036848,Bender," Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running people over.
",836849,Zoidberg," Many people dream of a fresh, new look. And Mary Kay can make those dreams come true.
",876850,Leela," Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New New York.  There was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre.
",1336851,Bender," Robot porno theatre? I was in that ... general area last night. Whoever ran me down out on the moors must've followed me back here.
",1336852,Hermes," Bender, mon, no one's trying to run you over. Stop being a big, hallucinating baby.
",856853,Bender," Yeah? Could a big, hallucinating baby do this:  I scared!
",596854,Vandal #1," I don't know which I like more: Smashing cars or smashing faces.
",666855,Vandal #2," Well, lucky you don't gotta decide tonight. Now come on, we got church tomorrow.  Did you hear something?
",1076856,Vandal #1," Ah, it was probably just a golden marmoset.
",456857,Vandal #2," That don't sound like no golden marmoset I ever heard.
",566858,Vandal #1," Made it!
",106859,Vandal #2," So anyway, what're you wearing tomorrow?
",426860,Bender," Where--? What the--?  Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened?
",776861,Sal," Gets outta here, yous lousy bum!
",346862,Bender," Please, I'm scared.
",216863,Sal," We're all scared, it's the human condition. Why do you thinks I put on this tough-guy facade? Now beat it!
",1086864,Bender," I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke up I found these in my chest cabinet.
",1196865,Fry," Aw, relax, buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps.
",746866,Bender," No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh, Lord! I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown.
",886867,Fry," Jeez, Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!
",546868,Bender," You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense.
",636869,Bender," Damn the expense!
",196870,Gypsy," My friend, you have nothing to worry about. Except a nightmare-ish life of unremitting horror!
",966871,Bender," Phew!
",76872,Gypsy," For, you see, you are a were-car.
",356873,Bender," A were-car?
",136874,Gypsy," The car that ran you down on the moors was also a were-car. It beamed a virus to you through its demonic headlights.
",1186875,Leela," That's crazy!
",156876,Gypsy," Yes. So crazy that it must be true! Each midnight, when your clock resets to zero, your hardware reconfigures into a murderous, four-wheeled car.
",1476877,Bender," I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?
",976878,Gypsy," Yes. But you must be willing to pay a terrible price.
",556879,Bender," Yeah, yeah, yeah.
",196880,Gypsy," Follow me.
",126881,Gypsy," According to this ancient read-me file, your only hope is to destroy the original were-car.
",936882,Bender," I'm with you.
",156883,Gypsy," In its death throes, the dread car will beam out the virus's uninstall program, thus ridding you of the curse.
",1126884,Bender," And otherwise I can never die?
",326885,Gypsy," Who said that? Sure you can die. You want to die?
",516886,Bender," No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!
",626887,Gypsy," Then live on, forever cursed. Each night, your attacks will become more gruesome until, one dark night, you are doomed to kill your dearest friend.
",1496888,Fry," I wouldn't wanna be me right now.
",356889,Gypsy,"  Now go! Go!  Uh, could one of you just-- Ah, forget it. I'll just sleep here.
",806890,Leela," There. No rampaging for you tonight.
",386891,Bender," Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
",646892,Leela," Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil.
",1276893,Fry," It'll be a rich, full day.
",286894,Leela," Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them.
",836895,Fry,"  Bender, no!
",146896,Leela,"  Fry, stay back!
",186897,Fry,"  You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?
",916898,Fry," I can't believe this! Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me.
",1736899,Leela," Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot.
",626900,Fry," Stop rubbing it in!
",216901,Bender," Oh, God! Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you, did I?
",656902,Fry," Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?
",686903,Bender," I tried to run you over?
",266904,Leela," It was very sweet of you, Bender.
",356905,Bender," Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two.
",606906,Fry," Words. Nothing but sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter, orange wax in my ears.
",856907,Leela," Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've got to go back to the castle and hunt down the original were-car.
",1356908,Fry," Yeah, yeah, yeah.
",196909,Leela," Cursed, got it.
",176910,Bender," Whatever.
",116911,Leela," The tracks lead here.
",236912,Fry," Thanks, eagle eye.
",206913,Leela," Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful: Many robots are stupid and violent.
",1036914,Bender,"  I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what, I'd pound him till--
",836915,Yokelbot," Get ye to your houses, ye ignorant villagers.
",476916,Leela," We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!
",846917,Yokelbot," Stop! What are ye doing?
",266918,Bender," We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk.
",656919,Yokelbot," Ye think me be he?
",206920,Bender," SÃ_.
",56921,Yokelbot," Nee. I mean, ""no"". I was given the curse many a year ago while on a bird-watching trip to the Arctic...
",1056922,Yokelbot,"  I was attacked by a vicious, motorised sled. The natives called it ""The Abominable Snowmobile"".
",986923,Inuitbot," Yes, it's true. I ran over that bird-watching jerk and a hundred others. Even my best friend from aromatherapy school.
",1206924,Fry," I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me.
",616925,Inuitbot," Alas, I'm afraid I'm not the original were-car. I received the curse while taking a learning annex class from a famous robot actor.
",1336926,Inuitbot,"  You know him as Calculon.
",286927,Calculon,"  Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills would avail me a sword with which to slay this wretched curse.
",1246928,Bender," Let's kick him some more.
",276929,Calculon," No, wait, let me explain.  It all began one fateful night a thousand years ago.
",816930,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!
",796931,Calculon," Lies! I change my identity and upgrade my appearance every few decades to avoid suspicion. I was all of history's great acting robots: Acting Unit 0.8, Thespo-mat, David Duchovny!
",1816932,Fry," Look, are you the original were-car or not?
",456933,Calculon," No, but you are nearing the end of your search. For, you see, I was attacked by the original were-car.
",1046934,Bender," Give us a name, MacButt!
",266935,Calculon," The year was 2019, and I was just a lowly robot arm...
",566936,Calculon,"  ...working in an automotive research lab. I was working on Project Satan ...  ... a savage, intelligent military vehicle built from the most evil parts of the most evil cars in all the world. The steering wheel from Hitler's staff car, the left-turn signal from Charles Manson's VW, the windshield wipers from that car that played Knight Rider.
",3476937,Fry," Knight Rider wasn't evil.
",276938,Calculon," His windshield wipers were. It didn't come up much in the show though. Anyway...
",826939,Calculon,"  Only after bringing Project Satan to life did they discover they had made a horrible mistake.  For, you see, it was pure evil.
",1296940,Leela," So what happened to Project Satan?
",366941,Calculon,"  It's either in Paris, or much more likely...
",476942,Calculon,"  ...still in the abandoned automotive lab.
",446943,Leela," You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato.
",1036944,Bender,"  Psst, there it is.
",216945,Leela," It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan?  Don't be afraid. We know what you are.
",966946,Project Satan," You do?
",96947,Leela," Would you like us to ... put you out of your misery?
",546948,Project Satan," Misery? What misery? I love killing people! Squishing them till their organs squirt out like chunky mustard.
",1106949,Bender," Look, everyone loves killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends.
",736950,Leela," Oh, no! It's midnight.
",246951,Bender," Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!
",446952,Leela," Fry, distract him.
",206953,Fry,"  Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian! 20 points!
",686954,Leela," Oh, no! There's no exhaust pipe!
",346955,Project Satan," That's right! Thanks to Ed Begley Jr.'s electric motor, the most evil propulsion system ever conceived!  Take whichever one you want.
",1356956,Bender," Oh, boy! I feel like a car in a candy store!
",466957,Fry,"  Yes! He chose me! He's trying to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy!   Oh, thanks, Bender.   Too tight! Too tight!
",1116958,Leela," Whoa!
",76959,Bender," Uh-oh.
",86960,Leela," Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?
",496961,Bender,"  I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt so empty inside.
",926962,Fry," Bender, I'm alive!  You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted to, and that's what matters.  Here's to you.
",1156963,Bender," Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!
",556964,Fry," I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!
",466965,Fry," Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship. We come in peace.
",906966,Bender," Tough luck!
",136967,Fry," Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?
",656968,Bender,"  Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship.
",456969,Fry," Do you think we should?
",256970,Bender,"  Yes, I do.
",136971,Farnsworth," Leela, have you seen the keys to the spaceship?
",496972,Leela,"  I must've left them onboard.
",316973,Farnsworth," Eh, wha? I mean, what?
",246974,Leela," Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether.
",906975,Amy," Oh, no!
",96976,Hermes," Sweet ghost of Babylon.
",256977,Zoidberg," This isn't good for Zoidberg!
",316978,Fry," Woo, yeah!
",126979,Bender," Woo-hoo!
",106980,Bender," Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!
",376981,Fry," That's the best thing I ever saw!
",356982,Italian #1," You stink!
",126983,Italian #1," Alright, yeah!
",166984,Italian #2," We like you a lot!
",206985,Fry," That was great!
",176986,Bender," And no one suspects a thing!  Whoa!  And that's how we learned our lesson!
",766987,Farnsworth," You've gone too far this time -- all three of you!
",526988,Leela," What did I do?
",166989,Farnsworth," You left the keys in the ignition. I mean, look at those two. Wasn't it obvious what would happen?
",1006990,Fry," Yeah, Leela.
",146991,Bender," We're all very disappointed in you.
",376992,Farnsworth," I should fire you three right now, but I'm just not that cold-hearted.
",726993,Hermes," You're all fired.
",196994,Zoidberg,"  Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you.  Good riddance to them. Now Zoidberg is the popular one!
",926995,Farnsworth," Yes, yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg.
",396996,Amy," Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, I've been thinking, do you think we could go out?
",706997,Farnsworth," So, Zoidberg, what's new?
",276998,Hermes," Tell me, Zoidberg: Is it carapace or carapass?
",486999,Zoidberg," Oh, you know!
",157000,Fry," What are we supposed to do for money?  All I've got is my frequent taffy eater's card, my first moustache ...  ... and this picture of me and my old girlfriend, Michelle, and that ski instructor she was just friends with.
",2237001,Bender," Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund?  Ow!
",717002,Leela," We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!
",677003,Fry," Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!
",1247004,Leela," No, we can get jobs.
",227005,Bender," But we just had jobs!
",237006,Leela," Fortunately, I still have our old career chips.
",497007,Fry," Our what?
",117008,Leela," Career chips.  You remember? They assign you the job you're best at.  I tried to give you one and you ran away.  It's how we met!
",1317009,Fry," And then what happened?
",257010,Leela," Just give me your hand.
",257011,Fry," Ow!
",57012,Leela," Baby!  Ow!
",127013,Leela," I'd like to reapply for my old job: Counselling defrostees and assigning them careers.
",887014,Ipgee," Oh, I was hoping you would come back! I even saved your poster of a chimp expressing your distaste for Mondays.
",1137015,Leela," Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, sir.
",437016,Ipgee," Just put your hand under the scanner so I can verify your career chip.  Calcutta, we have a problem.
",1027017,Leela," Delivery boy? I must have mixed up the chips. It's a simple mi--
",667018,Ipgee," Oh, here's a cryogenic counsellor! Do you like Mondays?
",577019,Fry," They're OK.
",137020,Ipgee," Then we'll have to redecorate your office. How do you feel about it helping to be crazy to work here but not being necessary?
",1277021,Bender," Hey, let's see what it says about me.
",397022,Ipgee," Welcome aboard, sir.
",227023,Terry," Remember, when the tube opens, say ...  ... ""Welcome to the world of tomorrow!""
",817024,Fry," Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what people wanna hear when they first wake up.  Bathroom's that way.
",1057025,Fry," So, while you're on the Probulator, tell me what brings you to the future.
",767026,Man #1," Oh, well, I wanted to meet Shakespeare and I figured that time was cyclical.
",787027,Fry," Nope. Straight line.  Ah, the Probulator's done.
",507028,Man #1," That wasn't so bad.
",217029,Fry," Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet.  OK, it's about to start.
",607030,Bender," Welcome to the future, human slave.  Ah, relax, chum. I'm not really a giant fly!  I'm a horrible robot!  Kill all humans!
",1247031,Terry," Dear God! He's having a heart attack!
",397032,Bender," Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future.
",587033,Terry," We have a cure for it now!
",287034,Bender," Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this.
",467035,Fry," Nothing like a power nap.
",277036,Old Man #1," Oh, flies! Flies and gorillas!
",327037,Bender," Stay beautiful, doll-face!  That Probulator sure knows how to please a man. So, what's for lunch?
",997038,Fry," I ordered a pizza.
",207039,Leela," Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener.  Yeah, very funny. Now cough up the $12.95.
",807040,Fry," Sorry, but if it's not here in half an hour, it's free.
",577041,Leela," It's only been 23 minutes.
",287042,Fry,"  Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes.
",337043,Chef," It's only been a-23 minutes, you dumb a-cannoli. You got a problem, we can take it outside.
",937044,Fry," OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can take him.
",497045,Leela," Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform.
",577046,Chef," 35, you stupid meatball.
",267047,Bender," Who should be unfreeze next?
",307048,Fry," No.  No!  Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!
",417049,Bender," Alright!
",107050,Fry," Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure caused some trouble in that bubble!
",827051,Shore," Rest assured, if it rhymes, I can cause trouble in it.
",567052,Fry," Hey, now that you're in the future, you can go live in an actual bio-dome!
",767053,Shore," An unattractive prospect. While researching for the role, I ran computer simulations demonstrating, incontrovertibly, that the whole bio-enclosure concept is fundamentally flawed. Be it expressed via dome, sphere, cube or even a stately tetrahedron, buddy!
",2587054,Fry," Oh.  So, how did you wind up getting frozen?
",467055,Shore," Well, while filming Encino Man my intellectual curiosity re: cryogenics was peaked, and I resolved to freeze the weasel.
",1227056,Fry," The weasel?
",137057,Shore," Hey, listen, skippy. I was supposed to be unfrozen in Hollywood for the thousandth anniversary screening of Jury Duty II. How come I'm not there?
",1477058,Fry," I woke you up early so we could hang out and do stuff.
",567059,Shore," Like what?
",127060,Fry," I love this job.
",187061,Bender," Me too.
",97062,Fry," Showtime!  I'll pretend to be dying of space plague.
",547063,Bender," Boo?
",67064,Fry," Michelle!
",117065,Bender," Oh, my God!
",137066,Michelle," Fry? Is it really you?
",247067,Fry," I don't know. Is it really you?
",337068,Michelle," What do you mean you don't know? Are you you or not?
",547069,Fry," Who wants to know?
",207070,Michelle," Oh, Fry, it is you!
",217071,Fry," I don't get it, Michelle. The last time I saw you, you were doing great. You had just dumped me and you were well on your way to getting you life back on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?
",1897072,Michelle," Oh, Fry. After you left, things took a turn for the worse. I got married.
",757073,Fry," I'm sorry.
",127074,Michelle,"  His name was Charles. He attended a law school so prestigious the basketball team was coached by Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  I put him through law school by working as a dog walker for antisocial dogs.
",1987075,Fry," Sorry.
",87076,Michelle,"  But soon after Charles graduated, our marriage ran into difficulties.
",727077,Fry," Uh, sorry.
",127078,Michelle,"  Desperately depressed, I turned to the one thing that could lessen my pain: A carnival. Unfortunately, a corn dog bone got lodged in the control panel of the Spizzler, and I had to ride it for eight hours.
",2087079,Fry,"  Sorry.
",97080,Michelle,"  But it did give me a chance to think...
",427081,Fry," I'm sorry.
",127082,Michelle," And I remembered the last time I was truly happy; when I was with you.
",727083,Fry," Aww. So you froze yourself to come look for me?
",497084,Michelle," No, I did it to get a fresh start. I didn't know what had happened to you -- no one did. The police were going to conduct a search but your parents felt it was a waste of taxpayer money.
",1887085,Fry," That's the same reason they kept me out of school. So, no one even cared that I was gone?
",917086,Michelle," Not really. Except for one person.
",367087,Fry," Who was it?
",137088,Michelle," Everything is so different.
",297089,Fry," Not everything. There's still a roach problem.
",487090,Michelle," Ew!
",57091,Michelle," Eurgh.
",87092,Fry," Nowadays, people aren't interested in art that's not tattooed on fat guys.
",767093,Sal," I'm on loan from the Louvre.
",307094,Leela," Please, Professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance.
",707095,Bender," Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to ...  ... Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!
",1137096,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Og, but I've got a new crew.
",417097,Farnsworth," So, how was delivery to Fantasy Planet, where everyone's fantasies come to life?
",827098,Amy," Great!
",87099,Hermes," Organised!
",127100,Zoidberg," For one beautiful night, I knew what it was to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honoured.
",927101,Farnsworth," You see, Og? Everything's running smoothly, yes. And with Fry fired, I can finally leave my jigsaw puzzles out without him eating the pieces.
",1437102,Leela," Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know.
",697103,Fry," Hey, guys.
",127104,Leela," Oh, uh, hey, Fry!
",197105,Bender," So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big, old-- Ow!
",607106,Fry," I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to introduce you to my on-again-off-again girlfriend of the past thousand years, Michelle.  Michelle, this is Leela.  This is Bender.  The Professor.  Hermes and Amy.
",2037107,Michelle," Nice to meet you.
",197108,Fry," And this is Dr. Zoidberg.
",277109,Hermes," Dating you ex, Fry? Have you lost all self-respect?
",537110,Fry," All what?
",117111,Farnsworth," This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house--
",477112,Bender," A home invasion by a former roommate.
",397113,Fry," But things are different this time. Before, she was demanding and possessive. But now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time.
",1447114,Zoidberg," There you go, dearies.
",247115,Michelle," It's a relief to meet you, Amy. I'm just having a hard time adjusting to all the strange stuff here in the future.
",1167116,Amy," I'm from Mars.
",167117,Michelle,"  I feel so out of place here. I don't understand why Fry fits in so well.
",757118,Leela,"  Probably because he didn't fit in back in your time.
",557119,Michelle," That's true. But I used to fit in really well.
",487120,Zoidberg," Then good luck, sister.
",257121,Michelle," Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but your friends are a bunch of freaks.
",777122,Fry," Yeah, they're great, huh?
",277123,Michelle," I just don't belong here. I don't know anyone, I can't find a vanishing cream that doesn't make me actually vanish. I don't even have a job.
",1427124,Fry," Oh, right. I was supposed to assign you a job. Let me just get your career chip installed.  Hold out your palm.  What are you scared of? It's just like getting your hand pierced.
",1807125,Michelle," This world is horrible. Let's start over, Fry. We'll go someplace where all we have is each other.
",1007126,Fry," Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there.
",517127,Michelle," It's not a ""there"". It's a ""then"".  The future.
",497128,Fry," Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were talking about one of those motels where the bed is shaped like stuff.
",1087129,Michelle," I love you. Don't you love me?
",327130,Fry," Well, sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this seems like a big step.
",837131,Michelle," Fry, why must you analyse everything with your relentless logic? Nothing matters but our love.
",967132,Fry," You're right. Let's do this now and let's never regret it.
",607133,Fry," Michelle, I don't regret this. But I both rue and lament it.
",627134,Fry," The year 4000 is severely disappointing. I miss the year 3000 when life was simple and brains flew through space and everyone ate lasers.
",1397135,Michelle," It's not that bad. Fate brought us together and now fate brought us here.
",757136,Fry," No, you brought us here.
",267137,Michelle," Whine some more, Fry, I really find that attractive in a man. Now come on, build us a shelter.
",967138,Fry," Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. At least we can have a nice place to live.
",827139,Fry," There!
",87140,Michelle," You expect me to live in a tiny little hole?
",467141,Fry," It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher.
",477142,Michelle," Oh, look! Some little kids.
",297143,Fry," They'll save us.  We're saved!
",327144,Butch," I'm Butch, leader of this place. I took your hole and you can't do nothing about it.
",867145,Michelle," OK.
",57146,Fry," Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society?
",717147,Butch," Well, alright. But no interfering with our grand works.
",577148,Fry," I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty good civilisation. I think I'll enjoy serving under him.
",957149,Michelle," You know your problem, Fry? You're not ambitious. You should be chief.
",727150,Fry," What do I need, ulcers?
",257151,Michelle," But I want power. I'm tired of the chief's girlfriend lording it over me with her fancy coyote hide.
",1027152,Fry," Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society.
",687153,Butch," On what grounds do you challenge my authority?
",487154,Fry," Well, I'm older than you. I can beat you up.
",467155,Kid #1," Yeah, I'll bet he could.
",267156,Butchs Girlfriend," He's got arm hair.
",207157,Butch," Alright, grandpa. There's only one way to settle this: Death rolling!
",717158,Fry," What's death rolling?
",237159,Orowheat," It's like skateboarding.
",267160,Ice-V," Except half the time, someone dies.
",377161,Fry," Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding.
",487162,Butch," Last one holding the bandana's the new leader.
",487163,Michelle," My mother always said you were a loser, Fry. Now get out there and prove her wrong.
",857164,Fry,"  Beth said that?
",187165,Butchs Girlfriend," Achat, shtayim, shalosh!
",267166,Butch," It's cool. Back off!   My knee. I scraped it!
",477167,Fry," Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take a look at-- Aha!  I won! I'm the new chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!
",1227168,Butch," Hand it over, you giant idiot.
",327169,Butchs Girlfriend," Hey, Butch, your mom's here.
",307170,Butch," Aw, man.
",107171,Butchs Mom," Come on, kids. You're late for Hebrew school.
",477172,Orowheat," I don't wanna go.
",197173,Butchs Girlfriend," Every Monday and Wednesday's the same thing.
",467174,Fry," I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out.
",847175,Michelle," That's because you're a loser. You were a loser in the year 2000 and you're a loser in the year 4000.
",1037176,Fry," Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all. Several friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man. But you wrecked everything.
",1507177,Michelle," Quit standing up for yourself, Fry. When we get back to the hole we are going to have a long, boring talk about our relationship!
",1317178,Fry," Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this:  I'm leaving you.
",517179,Fry," There must be people somewhere.
",337180,Fry," Yes! Footprints! And hand prints?  But? What's happening?
",597181,Leela," Fry, thank God we found you.
",307182,Fry," Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?
",557183,Leela," It's not the year 4000.
",257184,Bender," You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed.
",707185,Farnsworth," You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they were delivering it to his movie screening.
",847186,Leela," But, when they noticed you weren't him, they chucked you in a ditch.
",707187,Fry," So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?
",807188,Farnsworth," You wish! You're in Los Angeles!
",347189,Fry," But there was this gang of 10-year-olds with guns.
",527190,Leela," Exactly, you're in L.A.
",257191,Fry," But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.
",647192,Bender," That's L.A. for you.
",227193,Fry," But the air is green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.
",707194,Bender," He just won't stop with the social commentary.
",487195,Fry," And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it--  Michelle, baby!
",967196,Michelle," It's not working out, Fry.
",287197,Shore,"  Tis better to have loved and lost, n'est ce-pas?
",517198,Fry," That's it. I've had it with women. From now on, I'm concentrating on my career. Can I have my old job back?
",1097199,Farnsworth," Why, I've forgotten why I even fired you.
",437200,Bender," 'Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions.
",727201,Farnsworth," Oh, that's right. Get lost!
",297202,Hermes," People, we got a problem: Little Nibbler's been coughing up hairballs.
",727203,Leela," Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?
",407204,Fry," He's got me beat!
",197205,Hermes," Now we all love Nibbler, so it's only fair that we all pitch in and clean it up together. Still, I propose we make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?
",1477206,Leela," Yeah!
",77207,Bender," Alright, yup.
",157208,Hermes," All opposed?  All abstaining?
",317209,Leela," Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?
",277210,Fry," He's dead.
",127211,Bender," What?
",77212,Amy," Oh, no!
",97213,Farnsworth," He always seemed so full of life; laughing, singing, begging for scraps. And now this.
",887214,Zoidberg," Why with all the crying?  So that's where I left my shell.
",607215,Leela," I didn't know you could take this thing off.
",467216,Zoidberg," It was starting to get a little cramped in there so I molted, why not? Ah, the fresh air feels good!
",1027217,Farnsworth," Stop doing that!
",187218,Zoidberg," So long. I'm off to toss this old shell in the dumpster and maybe pick up those potato chips Amy didn't finish yesterday.
",1237219,Amy," Those were toenail clippings.
",317220,Zoidberg," A feast is a feast.
",217221,Amy," Hey, that's my cellphone!
",277222,Amy," Hello?  Hello? Who is this?  Hello? Hello?
",447223,Leela," What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone again?
",497224,Amy," Some guy's been calling and hanging up 10 times a day for a year.
",677225,Leela," Men who call too much are the worst ... I bet.
",487226,Amy," I just wish a decent guy would call me instead of this spleeze-ball who has me too terrified to even answer the phone.  Hello?
",1287227,Amy,"  Hello? Is anyone there?
",267228,Kif," I love you.  Why must I be such a coward?
",437229,Zapp," Kif, I'm headed to the men's room and I'll be needing an attendant, so-- Oh, I'm sorry. You're crying like a woman.  It's alright. I've always thought myself as a father figure to some of my more pathetic men. Kif, old friend, let's rap.
",2397230,Kif," Well, I'm in love with this girl--
",367231,Zapp,"  Oh, that's rich!  Go on.
",277232,Kif," I met her a year ago...
",257233,Kif,"  ...when we were escaping from that cruise ship you piloted directly into a black hole.
",897234,Zapp,"  Yes! It was in all the papers.
",337235,Amy," Call me.
",107236,Zapp," Uh-huh, uh-huh. Mm-hmm, uh-huh.
",337237,Kif," I've finished talking, sir.
",297238,Zapp," Belay that remark!  Your Amy knows my Leela? I have formed an idea!
",697239,Zapp," I'm calling to negotiate a double date. You and me, Kif and Amy.
",667240,Leela,"  Forget it.
",137241,Zapp,"  Then let the negotiations begin. I propose we go out on 10 dates.
",687242,Leela," How about zero?
",177243,Zapp,"  Nine.
",87244,Leela," Zero.
",77245,Zapp," Seven.
",87246,Leela," Zero.
",77247,Zapp,"  Eight?
",97248,Amy,"  Please, Leela? Kif's like the sweetest guy who's ever liked me.
",667249,Zapp,"  Five, and that's my final offer ... four.
",447250,Leela," One.
",67251,Zapp,"  Two.
",77252,Leela," One half.
",117253,Zapp," I'll take it.
",157254,Zapp,"  We'll meet you tonight for part of dinner and the first half of a movie.
",757255,Kif," Um, sir? I don't go out on many dates and, um, what if I can't think of anything to say?
",907256,Zapp," Here's my personal book of pickup lines.  Say as many of them as you can as fast as you can. Don't stop for any reason.
",1217257,Kif," Maybe I'll just give her these flowers.
",417258,Zapp," Wrong, wrong, wrong! And what's that? Candy? Candy's for dorks! Give me that.  Mmm!
",857259,Zapp," Hello, beautiful. I got these for you.
",407260,Leela," Thanks.
",97261,Zapp," Well, well. This looks to be one disturbingly erotic date.
",607262,Leela," Half-date.
",127263,Zapp," Waiter, bring us a bottle of wine.
",367264,Leela," Half-bottle.
",147265,Zapp," And some oysters on the half-shell.
",377266,Leela," Quarter-shell.
",167267,Kif," Oh, and I'd like--
",207268,Zapp," Kif's not hungry.  Kif, this place is expensive.  I'd like two steaks and the ladies will have some very sensual salads -- with low-cal sensual dressing.
",1557269,Morbo,"  Oh, won't you take me to funkytown,
Oh, won't you take me to funkytown.
 Thank you.
",867270,Amy," Kif, you're so quiet. You haven't said a word all night.
",587271,Kif," Well, um, um ... hello.
",257272,Amy," 'Cause I was really hoping we could talk and stuff.
",537273,Kif," Amy,  if I said you had a beautiful body would you take your pants off and dance around a little?
",997274,Amy," What?
",77275,Leela," Lieutenant Kroker!
",207276,Kif,"  I find the most erotic part of the woman is the boobies
",587277,Amy," Kif!
",67278,Kif," Oh, my!
",97279,Leela," This half-date is entirely over. Amy? Conference!
",517280,Kif," Is there nothing we can do, sir?
",347281,Zapp," There's only one sure-fire way back into a woman's heart and parts beyond. I speak, of course, of karaoke.
",1087282,Kif,"  My years in the DOOP Boys' Chorus will not have been in vain!
",647283,Leela," Alright, enough lipstick. Let's storm out.
",447284,Kif,"  Once upon a time I was falling in love,
But now I'm only falling apart...
",767285,Amy," Oh, that's so emotional!
",267286,Kif,"  There's nothing I can do,
A total eclipse of the heart--
",597287,Zapp," Amateur hour's over.  Let me show you why they call me ""The Velour Fog""! Hit it!
 I met her in a club down in old Soho,
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola,
C-O-L-A ... Cola.
",2007288,Man #1," Aw, give us a break!
",227289,Woman #1," Get off!
",107290,Chef," He sickens me!
",167291,Zapp,"  She walked up to me and she asked me to dance,
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said,
 Leela!
L-E-E-L-A, Leela!
Lee-Lee-Lee-Lee-Leela!
Ba-ba-ba-dum-ba-dum-bum!Leela!
",1867292,Leela," We're going home. Call us a space taxi.
",417293,Zapp," No need. There's not a restaurant built I can't fly. Where to, ladies?
",727294,Kif," Please, sir. Let's just divide up the check and--
",517295,Zapp," Let's see what this eatery can do.
",367296,Zapp," Ah, she's built like a steakhouse, but she handles like a bistro.  She's out of control!
",907297,Zapp,"  You win again, gravity!
",267298,Zoidberg," Look what arrived: My new shell catalogue. So let's try some on, already!  Ah! Muy macho! Hey, gringos, here comes El Zoido to ruin your drinking water!
",1547299,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I find that offensive.
",587300,Zoidberg," You Latins are so hot-blooded!  This one's like a summer guy!
",637301,Hermes," Look, you fat fish, the Planet Express health plan only covers one kind of replacement shell.
",957302,Fry," I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call the restaurant.
",1007303,Operator,"  The number you have dialled has crashed into a planet. Please make a note of it.
",837304,Fry," We gotta go rescue them!
",267305,Bender," Eh, I don't know.
",197306,Fry," Bender! Think of the seÃ±oritas!
",337307,Bender," VÃ¡monos!
",107308,Kif," So, Amy, um, well--
",217309,Amy," It's always a line with you!
",307310,Leela," What planet is this anyway?
",297311,Zapp,"  I 'unno.  This whole sector is uncharted.
",447312,Kif," It is not uncharted, you lost the chart!
",427313,Zapp," Well, nothing to do now but repopulate the human race.  Just me and you!   And maybe you.
",917314,Amy," What is it?
",137315,Kug," Me hear people, but me not see people.
",407316,Thog," No big deal. Everybody make mistake.
",387317,Zapp," Well, hello! I usually don't say this but you are the most beautiful trio of gigantic ladies I've ever laid eyes on.   I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boo--
",1727318,Fry," Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?
",357319,Bender," No. But what do you make of this?
",357320,Fry," I don't know. But it might have something to do with this.
",607321,Bender," Oh, your God!
",157322,Kug," Move! Go!
",117323,Fry," Alright, here's the plan--
",287324,Bender," What kind of moronic plan is that?  Wow!
",427325,Thog," Women go free. Men stay in chains.
",367326,Ornik," We take them to our leader. She know what do.
",477327,Fry," Pft. A female leader?
",237328,Leela," Fry, shut up.
",157329,Fry,"  Yes, Captain!
",167330,Thog," This capital city planet Amazonia.
",367331,Leela," Where are all the men in your society?
",407332,Ornik," Men die out many year ago.
",287333,Bender," With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are you with me, fellas?
",907334,Thog," Here stadium, where our women basketball teams play.
",547335,Kug," We no can dunk, but good fundamentals.
",407336,Ornik," That more fun to watch.
",257337,Zapp,"  Oh, God, you're killing me!  Ow! God, you're killing me!
",597338,Thog," This our comedy club. Humour here funny in different way.
",597339,Ornik," It not reinforce stereotypes.
",317340,Kug," Comedy come from character, real situations. Not abstract craziness.
",707341,Bender," Translation: Boring!   That's a good one!  Ow!
",487342,Amy," This women-only planet is sounding better and better.
",557343,Leela," I'm already looking for apartments.
",377344,Thog," Here live vengeful, all-knowing leader. She decide men's fate.
",647345,Fry," Is she hot?
",137346,Thog," That not important. She all-knowing.
",387347,Fry," In other words, ""No"".  Ow!
",287348,Thog,"  All hail Femputer.
",217349,Kug," and   All hail Femputer.
",267350,Amy," You all obey a big computer?
",307351,Kug," Yes. It appear mysteriously just about time men die out.
",587352,Leela," So why did you make it your leader?
",377353,Ornik," It seemed like different kind of politician.
",467354,Kug," Not beltway insider.
",227355,Thog," Femputer, we bring offering of bath beads and scented soaps.
",627356,Femputer," Your gift pleases Femputer. Femputer demands to know why there are men on her planet.
",877357,Fry," It was an accident, ma'am.
",287358,Femputer," That does not fempute. Femputer will return after deciding your punishment.
",777359,Fry," Leela, I'm through making fun of women. Now I want them to help me.
",697360,Amy," Should we do something?
",257361,Leela," There's no hurry.
",197362,Zapp," Yes! A little tighter.  Tighter. Perhaps a hard spanking is in order?  Too hard!
",827363,Kug," Men strange. You have them on your planet?
",447364,Leela,"  I'm afraid so.
",177365,Kug," What they for?  Oh, you mean ""snu-snu"".
",417366,Thog," We hear tell men used for snu-snu. But all we have go on are ancient legend and subscription to Cosmo.
",1047367,Zapp," Just FYI, I could be used for snu-snu.
",407368,Thog," Silence. You want die like last men visit Amazonia?
",537369,Fry," What'd they die of?
",217370,Kug," Crushed pelvises.
",197371,Fry," Yes!
",67372,Zapp," Oh, thank you, Lord in heaven!
",327373,Femputer," After lengthy femputations, I, Femputer, have decided the fate of the men. Femputer sentences them to death.  By snu-snu!
",1237374,Fry,"  Yay!
",77375,Zapp,"  Yeah!   What are you, gay?
",297376,Femputer," Death to the men. Death by snu-snu.
",377377,Fry," Although the snu-snu part's gonna be pretty good.
",517378,Zapp," Baby, it'll blow your mind.
",297379,Leela," Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are annoying and they wreck up whatever planet they're in charge of, but most of these men are sorta my friends. They don't deserve to die.
",1757380,Femputer," Hmm. Perhaps men are not as evil as Femputer thinks.
",547381,Thog," But they make fun women's basketball.
",397382,Femputer," What? Did you explain how the women's good fundamentals make up for their inability to dunk?
",947383,Ornik," Yes. They still laugh.
",247384,Femputer," The men must die.
",197385,Bender," Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. It's an understandable mistake. You can let me down now, thanks.
",1817386,Kug," He big jerk like man.
",237387,Bender," I sure am. But check the crotch.  Nothing.
",447388,Femputer," Very well, release him. As for the others, take them to the snu-snu chambers.
",797389,Bender,"  I'll miss you, meatbag.
",267390,Leela," Me too, meatbag.
",187391,Fry," Goodbye, friends. I never thought I would die like this. But I'd always really hoped.
",877392,Femputer,"  The Amazonians will be divided into three groups. The one called ""Zapp"" will be snu-snu'd by the large women. He that is designated ""Fry"" will be snu-snu'd by the petite women. And Kif, as the most attractive male, will be snu-snu'd by the most beautiful women of Amazonia. Then the large women. Then the petite women. Then the large women again.  Initiate snu-snu!
",3687393,Amazonians,"  Snu-snu, snu-snu, snu-snu!
",297394,Kif," Amy, before I die, I have to tell you: I didn't mean to say those awful things on our date. They were all Zapp's idea.
",1207395,Amy," Really? Honest and true?
",267396,Kif," Yes. And-And that person calling and hanging up was me. I was just too nervous to say hello because I love you.
",1137397,Amy," Oh, Kif!
",107398,Thog," It Thog's first time.  Be gentle!
",357399,Leela," We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the Femputer and reprogram it to let them go.
",1117400,Bender," Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it!  Alright, I'll go!
",717401,Fry,"  Ooh! Yeah!
",137402,Zapp,"  Oh, baby!
",127403,Guard #1 #1," How Tonk look?
",167404,Guard #1 #2," Tonk look good. Me fat.
",257405,Guard #1 #1," No, you look good. Tonk fat.
",307406,Femputer," Intruder! Stay away from the mighty Femputer! Guards!
",557407,Bender," Time to override the CPU and reprogram this Femputer.
",557408,Femputer," Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop it! Stop it! Hey, cut that out!
",557409,Fembot #1," Cease hitting Femputer!
",257410,Bender," You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!
",387411,Fembot #1,"  It's true. I disguised myself as a Femputer so I could rule the Amazonians.
",787412,Bender," But why?
",107413,Fembot #1," Why? Why? I came here from a faraway planet. A planet ruled by a chauvinistic Manputer that was really a Manbot. Have you any idea how it feels to be a Fembot living in a Manbot's Manputer's world?
",1997414,Bender," What?
",77415,Fembot #1," And now, my meddling Manbot, there's the question of what to do with you!
",757416,Zapp,"  We need rest. The spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
",757417,Ornik," It time snu-snu!
",187418,Fry," Can't we just cuddle?   Nooo!
",317419,Leela," We can't wait for Bender. It's time for a woman's touch.  Yah! Hi-yah! Yah, yah, yah!
",877420,Amy,"  Me next snu-snu. Out me way.
",317421,Thog," Where go beautiful man?  Me want snu-snu!
",437422,Amy," Kif! Jump!
",127423,Kif," My hero!
",107424,Thog,"  Me not get snu-snu! Get him!
",317425,Thog," Mighty Femputer. Small girl steal green kissy man. We kill her now?
",697426,Fembot #1,"  Come back later. Leave me alone.
",357427,Bender,"  Yeah, get lost!   Ooh! I'm a scary Femputer. Release the prisoners!   And bring gold. Lots of gold.
",1027428,Thog," Gold? Why Femputer want gold?
",317429,Fembot #1,"  You heard the man.
",217430,Bender,"  C'mon! Gimme some of that!
",297431,Zoidberg," And that's how I got my new shell. It looks just like the shell I threw out yesterday and I found it in the same dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon inside.  Pretty good story, eh, Hermes?
",1967432,Hermes," Stick to someone else, you windy barnacle!
",447433,Leela," It's funny how the battle of the sexes was only resolved when a Manbot and a Fembot realised they loved each other.
",1177434,Bender," Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold says that was the best mission ever!
",1087435,Amy," It sure was.
",147436,Fry," Oh, yeah!
",117437,Zapp," I had snu-snu!
",167438,Kif," So, um, Amy, w-what do you wanna do now?
",427439,Man #1,"  Breaker-breaker, this here's the Duck. Uh, you wanna back off them hogs?
",757440,Man #1,"  Ten-four, five miles or so.
",307441,Man #1 #2,"  Ten, roger!
",147442,Leela," Hmm, I'd better check the fluid levels.   We're OK on Coke syrup.
",677443,Bender," Oh, man! Come on!  Comin' through!
",367444,Bender," What's that black cracker?
",287445,Fry," A tomato.
",117446,Leela," You're not gonna eat a sandwich from a truck stop men's room are you?
",717447,Fry," Eh, what's the worst thing that could happen?  Ugh! It's like a party in my mouth and everyone's throwing up!
",1117448,Trucker," Lookie there! It's one of them things like on our mud flaps!
",627449,Hoschel," Yosemite Sam?
",157450,Sal," Stands back! I'm gonna puts my moves on her.  Whoas!
",547451,Fry," That jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless they're prepared to take it to the next level!
",937452,Leela," Fry, please. That's sweet but I'd rather not even dignify them with an ass-whooping!
",867453,Sal," Hey, sexy mama, let's get busy and freaky in that order!
",587454,Fry," Hey, jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she wanted to make love with you?
",1017455,Sal," Eh, I gots five minutes. She looks pretty good for a truck stop chick!
",727456,Fry," You take that back! She does not look good for a truck stop chick!
",687457,Sal," Yeah, you're right. She don't gots enough meat for a guy like me.
",677458,Fry," She does too! She's loaded with meat! She's got more meat than a cow!  Ow!
",767459,Sal,"  More meat than a cow!
",247460,Fry," I can't please Leela no matter what I do. I just want her to like me.
",717461,Bender," Well there's always hope.  C'mon, we gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler.
",777462,Bender," Who are you?
",147463,Scruffy," Scruffy. The janitor.
",237464,Bender," Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?
",407465,Scruffy," Schedule conflict.
",207466,Bender," There! Fixed forever.
",237467,Scruffy," Scruffy's gonna die the way he lived.  Oh, marmalade!
",557468,Zoidberg," Oh, the hypochondriac's back! So what is it this time?
",567469,Fry," Well, my lead pipe hurts a little.
",367470,Zoidberg," That's normal. Next patient.
",307471,Bender," He's a witch!
",157472,Farnsworth," Fry, did you eat anything unusual recently?
",457473,Fry," No.
",57474,Leela," What about that bathroom egg salad from the truck stop?
",577475,Fry," I've had better.
",187476,Farnsworth," Egg salad? Hmm. Zoidberg will have to examine your gastrointestinal tract. Come, everyone. Give Fry some privacy.
",1157477,Farnsworth," If you can't see well enough through the two-way mirror, there'll be a close-up on this video screen.
",1037478,Zoidberg," Hmm. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.  Guess again.
",757479,Amy," Gross!
",87480,Bender,"  Go, man! Go!
",157481,Farnsworth," Watch for any subtle irregularity in Fry's bowel.
",517482,Amy," It's gorgeous. That place used to be a big dump.
",507483,Bender," Oh! Ew!
",97484,Amy," Worms? Ew! Puke-a-tronic!
",277485,Leela," So the eggs in that egg salad sandwich were--
",477486,Farnsworth," Correct! Worm eggs! And the mayonnaise was probably none too fresh either.
",767487,Hermes," It's nauseating, mon!  Is there no way to get rid of the disgusting maggots?
",787488,Farnsworth," Only one. We'll have to travel deep inside Fry, in this!
",587489,Bender," Shotgun!
",107490,Zoidberg,"  Shotgun!
",117491,Farnsworth," In each gastro-survival kit, you'll find a rain slicker, a disposable fun camera, and something to protect you against bacteria -- a harpoon!
",1437492,Bender," Yo, old guy, why do we have to use those tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?
",877493,Farnsworth," Oh, my, no. That would require extremely tiny atoms, and have you priced those lately? I'm not made of money! Leave me alone!
",1277494,Zoidberg," Me next!
",107495,Farnsworth-Droid," Anyhoo, your net suits will let you experience Fry's worm-infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.
",1237496,Zoidberg-Droid," There's no part of that sentence I didn't like.
",497497,Farnsworth-Droid," Is everyone present?
",227498,Amy-Droid," Right on!
",117499,Bender-Droid," Uh-huh.
",97500,Hermes-Droid," Definitely.
",137501,Zoidberg-Droid," Yes.
",67502,Farnsworth-Droid," Here's the plan:  We'll enter the ear, drip down the back of the throat and make for the bowel. There, we'll irritate the pelvic splanchnic ganglion and cause an intestinal spasm, expelling, among other things, the parasites.
",2277503,Bender-Droid," I'll tell Fry to wash out, among other things, his ear.
",577504,Farnsworth-Droid," No! Fry can't know anything about the mission. If he finds out, the worms will try to defend themselves. They know everything he knows.
",1377505,Bender-Droid," They know how to make ice cream soup?
",397506,Farnsworth-Droid," Leela, your role is to distract Fry so he doesn't notice what we're up to.
",767507,Leela,"  Can do!
",107508,Amy-Droid," Leela, you should really try a facial scrub, for your pores.
",627509,Leela," Look! A starling!
",197510,Fry,"  Really?
",107511,Farnsworth-Droid,"  Sh! Be very quiet. We're in the ear.
",397512,Amy-Droid,"  OK, Professor.
",177513,Farnsworth-Droid,"  What?
",87514,Fry," What about what?
",187515,Leela," Uh ... what if we go for a walk, possibly, because it's such a lovely day, perhaps.
",857516,Fry," I'd love to!
",147517,Hermes-Droid," We gotta get someplace where he won't stick his finger!
",577518,Bender-Droid," It's hopeless! Abandon ship!
",307519,Farnsworth-Droid," Wait! We just have to get past the eardrum.
",457520,Hermes-Droid,"  What are those worms doing to Fry's brain?
",457521,Farnsworth-Droid,"  They're giving it a complete tune-up. A cursory glance would suggest they've doubled his thinking power.
",1077522,Hermes-Droid,"  My God! Soon he'll be smarter than Cher!
",437523,Fry," Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can evoke our deepest emotions.  For you.
",1147524,Leela," That's such a beautiful thought, Fry. And what's more amazing, you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me.
",1117525,Farnsworth-Droid," Brace yourselves, everyone. We're entering the interior of Fry's nose.
",727526,Bender-Droid," We're at finger alert five.
",297527,Farnsworth-Droid," Let's just pray nothing stimulates the delicate smell receptors.  Nobody make a smell.
",887528,Zoidberg-Droid," Quick! We can escape through that nasal capillary into the sinus.
",677529,Hermes-Droid," Strange. Usually you don't know anything about human anatomy.
",637530,Zoidberg-Droid," I learned it from a decongestant commercial.  ""Soothing action, action, action, action...""
",927531,Bender-Droid," Where are we? The ass?
",247532,Farnsworth-Droid," We're in the heart. Better known as ""The Love Muscle"".
",567533,Zoidberg-Droid," Where the food is digested.
",297534,Farnsworth-Droid," We should be safe, just so long as nothing makes it beat faster.
",667535,Bender-Droid," Abandon ship!
",157536,Farnsworth-Droid," No! Set course for that cholesterol-encrusted valve.
",547537,Zoidberg-Droid," It's good cholesterol but it spreads like bad cholesterol!
",607538,Amy-Droid,"  Look! They're jazz-ercising Fry's muscles!
",457539,Hermes-Droid," He'll be as strong and flexible as Gumby and Hercules combined!
",657540,Zoidberg-Droid," Gumbercules? I love that guy!
",317541,Leela," It's that jerk from the truck stop!  Let's cross the street and try to blend in with that crowd of pimps.
",1077542,Fry," I don't think so.  Sir, I believe you owe this lady an apology.
",657543,Leela," Fry, no! He's bulging with what could be muscles.  Ooh!
",577544,Sal," I gots your apologys right heres!  Sorrys, ma'am. I've learnsed a lesson about not ogling cans that I won't soons forgets.
",1247545,Farnsworth-Droid,"  Ah, the stomach: Scenic gateway to the bowel.
",487546,Bender-Droid," Abandon ship!
",157547,Farnsworth-Droid," No! Don't give up now! We're but a stone's throw from the pyloric sphincter.
",787548,Bender-Droid,"  Hooray!
",107549,Zoidberg-Droid,"  Hooray!
",107550,Hermes-Droid,"  We made it!
",147551,Farnsworth-Droid," There it is! The stately capitol of Fry's bowel. A heavily-guarded fortress surrounding the pelvic splanchnic ganglion.
",1217552,Zoidberg-Droid," I've heard of that! Who said I haven't?
",417553,Farnsworth-Droid," If we can stimulate that nerve, the bowel will convulse, expelling the entire worm society.
",937554,Hermes-Droid," But what about the worms in the other parts of his body?
",587555,Farnsworth-Droid," Listen, this is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement. Afterwards he'll be lucky if he has any bones left!
",1087556,Bender-Droid," Alright, let's mush some worms!
",337557,Worm Mayor," Worms to battle stations!
",277558,Leela," I had a great time today. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. But can I aks you something?
",1087559,Fry," Anything.
",117560,Leela," Why did you do all that stuff?
",327561,Fry," Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even when it's not.
",1787562,Leela," What is it? Is it about Bender?
",337563,Fry," No, it's about you and me.
",287564,Leela," And Bender?
",137565,Fry," Bender's not involved.  Leela ... I love you.
",477566,Leela," You do?
",97567,Fry," Yes. But it's only recently that I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you, Leela, and I always have.
",1147568,Leela," Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful-- Wait! Recently? Like since you ate that toilet sandwich?
",1017569,Fry," Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day.
",677570,Leela," Stay here.
",127571,Waitress," Freshen your noc-a-tina?
",267572,Fry," Please.  I need something to settle my stomach.
",497573,Farnsworth-Droid," The nerve is through here. Where's Zoidberg?
",467574,Zoidberg-Droid," Yippie-ki-yay! You'll never guess where I've been!
",527575,Bender-Droid,"  One! Two! Three!
",197576,Farnsworth-Droid," There it is! The pelvic splanchnic ganglion.  Tickle it and get ready for the ride of your lives!
",997577,Leela-Droid," Don't even think about tickling that ganglion!
",487578,Farnsworth-Droid," Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them!
",1757579,Hermes-Droid," I call it ""Caribbean Drain-o""!
",327580,Farnsworth-Droid," Fry will be stuck with the worms forever.
",437581,Leela-Droid," Perfect.
",107582,Zoidberg-Droid," Ouch!
",77583,Amy," I'm OK.
",97584,Farnsworth," Leela, you ignorant dope! Now the worms will be in Fry forever.
",657585,Leela," So? Did you ever stop to think that Fry is better off with worms?
",677586,Farnsworth," Oh, that's stupid!
",207587,Fry," If anyone wants to tell me what's going on here, I'll be in the lounge.
",737588,Fry," Of all the parasites I've had over the years, these worms are among the-- Hell! They are the best! Leela, how can I ever repay you for saving them?
",1497589,Leela,"  I'll think of something.
",277590,Bender," 'Ello! What's all this then?
",307591,Fry," Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!
",617592,Leela,"  I should warn you, it's a little under-furnished.
",527593,Leela," I'm thinking of having a window installed.
",447594,Fry," I think the view's perfect already!
",377595,Leela," Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever heard! Let me show you the bedroom.
",777596,Fry," Wait. In a minute.
",207597,Leela," A holophonor? Only a few people in the whole universe can play that, and they're not very good at it.
",1037598,Fry," They don't have you to inspire them.
",387599,Leela," I don't have words to say how wonderful you are, Fry. I haven't felt this happy since double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium.
",1277600,Fry," When I'm with you, every day seems like double-soup Tuesday.
",627601,Leela," Oh, Fry! I love what you've become.
",377602,Fry," What I've become.
",197603,Leela," What is it?
",137604,Fry," There's just something I have to find out.
",447605,Fry-Droid," Who controls this bowel?
",267606,Worm Guard #1 #1," Who wants to know?
",207607,Worm Mayor," I am the Lord Mayor of Cologne.
",337608,Fry-Droid," You mean ""colon""?
",197609,Worm Mayor," State your business!
",227610,Fry-Droid," Your Excellency, have you ever been in love?
",467611,Worm Mayor," No. I thought I was once but then I remember our species reproduces with a cloud of spores.
",937612,Fry-Droid," Well, a wonderful girl loves me. But I need to know if it's really me she loves, or just what you worms have made of me. That's why, with all due respect, I'm asking you to leave.
",1817613,Worm Mayor," Listen, you: I was born here, I raised a cloud of children here, my ancestors came over here on the sandwich.  No one can make me leave.
",1387614,Fry-Droid," Everyone out of my body or the brain gets it!
",477615,Worm Mayor," He's bluffing! No creature would willingly make an idiot out of itself.
",737616,Fry-Droid," Obviously you've never been in love!  Ow! Ow! Ow!  Now, the hand-eye co-ordination lobe.
",907617,Worm Guard #1 #1," Stop it, man!
",157618,Worm Mayor," You've damaged your brain, Universe, but no more than a week of binge drinking or five minutes on a cell phone.
",1137619,Fry-Droid," I was just working my way towards the medulla oblongata, control centre of the heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, you die with me.
",1367620,Worm Guard #1 #2," Wait a minute, man!
",217621,Fry-Droid," I hope Satan has a nice colon, 'cause that's where you're gonna be living!
",767622,Worm Mayor," Stop! We'll leave.  But one day you'll be eating a fast-food burger and boom! You'll be crawling with us again. Ever wonder what makes special sauce so special? Yo!
",1667623,Leela," Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?
",667624,Fry," I'm about to.  Leela, let me play for you one for time.
",577625,Leela," You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before.
",597626,Fry," Please, it's important to me.
",317627,Leela," What's that supposed to mean?
",317628,Fry," I don't know. I got nervous and I started thinking about neck bolts.  Wow! Did you see that vase break? It was all like--
",1237629,Leela," What's happened to you?
",257630,Fry," Nothing. I got rid of the worms.
",347631,Leela," What? Why would you do that?
",307632,Fry," Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them.
",657633,Leela," Well ... which of you wrote me that sonnet?
",457634,Fry," I did ... I think. It was probably about 50/50. But that's how I really felt about you, I swear!
",987635,Leela," I don't know.
",157636,Fry," Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed-- Uh-oh!
",2207637,Bender," Sorry you struck out, sausage link.
",377638,Bender," If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!
",727639,Fry," Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up.
",597640,Bender," There you go!  Goodnight. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars!
",847641,Linda,"  In what has become a winter tradition, members of the Zarlon 7 Polar Bear Club today took the plunge into a river of liquid ammonia.
",1357642,Morbo,"  There were no survivors.
",277643,Linda,"  Takes all kinds! And now, with his annual Xmas message, here's the head of the Xmas Safety Council, the head of Walter Cronkite.
",1317644,Walter Cronkites head,"  Season's warnings, Linda and Morbo.
",387645,Bender," This guy's too trustworthy. What's his angle?
",477646,Cronkite,"  In all the tinsel and terror of the holiday season we too often underestimate that murderous brute better known as Santa Claus. With images of last year's gingerbread massacre freshly baked into our memories, I remind you to bolt your doors, say goodbye to your pets and lock your children in the closet. This is Walter Cronkite saying, ""I told you so"".
",3567647,Hermes," Sacred boa of West and Eastern Samoa. We've got to secure for Santa's arrival.
",807648,Fry," Just as well. I'm getting tired of this wood show.
",527649,Farnsworth," Cover that fireplace, confound you! I've only a few years to live. I don't wanna spend them dead.
",997650,Leela," We're pushing as hard as we can.
",347651,Bender," Oh, pushing!
",147652,Farnsworth," Oh, we're doomed! Every year we're doomed. Thanks be I had these bullet-proof shutters installed.
",997653,Farnsworth," Bring it on, Santa! That bloodthirsty cadaver junkie can't touch us as long as we're not stupid enough to leave this building.
",1287654,Fry,"  Alright!
",117655,Leela,"  Yeah!
",87656,Farnsworth," In a related matter, you'll be delivering this sack of children's letters directly to Santa at his death fortress on Neptune.
",1277657,Fry," These letters are real butt-nutters!  Listen to this one:  Dear Santa.
",727658,Girl,"  Please, please don't bring me any gifts. The bicycle you fired at me last year from your bicycle gun really tore up my insides.
",1307659,Leela," Awful! Let's read some more.  Dear Santa.
",437660,Boy,"  Please bring me a coffin for Grandpa. You choked him with a chestnut last year and he's beginning to smell a lot like Xmas if you know what I mean.
",1507661,Fry," It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed to bring people together, not blow them apart!
",917662,Bender," Sure, but who's going to do anything about it? Certainly not us. No, sir!
",757663,Fry," Certainly yes us, uh-huh, sir! We've gotta bring back the kind of Xmas I remember.
",847664,Leela," Fry's right. It's time to sit on Santa's lap -- and hard!
",597665,Leela," Oh, look! A cute little welcoming party.
",427666,Aide #1," Hey! Wanna buy a tiny little kidney?
",387667,Aide #2," I'll let you punch me for a buck.
",357668,Fry," Uh, look; we've got mail for Santa. Are you his elves?
",567669,Aide #2," We're not elves. We're Neptunians.
",367670,Aide #1," We're just shrimp-y because he doesn't feed us.
",497671,Aide #2," You hit me! You owe me a dollar.
",347672,Aide #3," Hey, you got any food? Old teabags, chewed gum, apple cores? Come on! We're starving here!
",927673,Fry," But you live in a gingerbread house.
",387674,Aide #4," Hey! It's food or shelter, not both.
",387675,Bender," You lazy runts! Don't you get paid for making the toys?
",577676,Aide #4," Who said ""toys""?
",187677,Neptunians," Toys? Toys? Who said ""toys""?
",307678,Aide #2," False alarm, folks! There's no reason to make toys since Santa judges everyone to be naughty.
",957679,Fry," That's it! I'm gonna deliver a gift of my boot up Santa's chimney. Where is he?
",817680,Aide #2," There! In his ice fortress.
",297681,Leela," We'll need help getting in. Any volunteers?
",457682,Aide #1," I'll help you!
",167683,Aide #2," Ah, phooey!
",137684,Aide #2," An omen?
",107685,Aide #1," Dinner!
",97686,Santa," Let's see who's been naughty, and who's been naughty!  Mobsters beating up a shopkeeper for protection money. Very naughty!  Shopkeeper's not paying their protection money. Exactly as naughty!  I saw that!  Huh?
",2137687,Aide #2," We brought your mail.
",237688,Santa," Don't you ever knock? Who knows what naughty things I could be watching? I get New Orleans on this thing, you know!
",1177689,Aide #2," Don't kill us!
",167690,Leela," Santa's a robot, so we should be able to destroy him with a logical paradox. Bender, you'd better cover your ears.
",1167691,Santa," Holy night! Intruders!
",247692,Leela," Hold it, Santa!  Consider this: You are programmed to destroy the naughty, but many of those you destroy are in fact nice. I submit to you that you are naughty and, logically, you must destroy yourself.
",2047693,Santa," Nice try. But my head was built with paradox-absorbing crumple-zones.
",717694,Leela," Wait! This is what we're running from!
",407695,Fry," Faster! Faster!
",177696,Fry," Why aren't we moving?
",237697,Leela," I don't know. Usually when I do stuff like this the ship moves.
",657698,Santa," Ho, ho-- Eh?
",147699,Fry," He's trapped!
",157700,Aide #2," Now we can make toys again!
",297701,Neptunians,"  Toys! Toys! Toys!
",207702,Fry," And I can deliver them. Billions and billions in one night.
",617703,Santa," Ha! No human could do all that.
",337704,Fry," Evil Knievel could!
",217705,Santa," Nuh-uh!
",97706,Bender," Santa's right. We need some sort of robot.  Aw, crap! I'm some sort of robot.
",797707,Neptunians," Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!
",277708,Santa," Bender can't be Santa! He wasn't built to Yuletide specifications.
",687709,Bender," Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either.  But that didn't stop me.
",887710,Leela," Bender!
",97711,Bender," Bow to your new Santa!
",247712,Neptunians," Our hero!
",117713,Neptunians,"  We are free and fairly sober,
With so many toys to build.
",607714,Neptunians,"  The machines are kinda tricky,
Probably someone will be killed,
But we gladly work for nothing--
",997715,Fry,"  Which is good because we don't intend to pay.
",487716,All,"  The elves are back to work today!
",367717,Neptunians,"  Hooray!
We have just a couple hours,
To make several billion gifts,
And the labour isn't easy--
",987718,Leela,"  Then you'll all work triple shifts,
You can make the job go quicker if you turn up the controls to super-speed.
",1147719,Fry," ,  and   It's back to work on Xmas Eve!
",417720,Neptunians,"  Hooray!
",107721,Leela,"  And though you're cold and sore and ugly,
Your pride will mask the pain.
",757722,Fry,"  Let my happy smile warm your hearts--
",407723,Aide #5,"  There's a toy lodged in my brain!
",367724,Neptunians,"  We are getting awfully tired,
And we can't work any faster,
And we're very, very sorry--
",917725,Bender,"  Why you selfish little bastards,
Do you want the kids to think that Santa's just a crummy, empty-handed jerk?
",1127726,Aide #6," Ow!
",57727,Bender,"  Then shut your yaps and back to work.
",407728,Neptunians,"  Now it's very nearly Xmas,
And we've done the best we could,
",637729,Fry,"  These toys soldiers are poorly painted.
",427730,Leela,"  And they're made from inferior wood.
",397731,Bender,"  I should give you all a beating,
But I really have to fly.
",617732,Santa,"  If I weren't stuck here frozen,
I'd harpoon you in the eye.
",627733,Neptunians,"  Now it's back into our tenements,
To drown ourselves in rye.
",637734,Leela,"  You did the best you could,
I guess that some of these gorillas are OK.
",747735,Aide #7," We're adequate!
",177736,All,"  The elves have rescued Xmas Day! Hooray!
",437737,Bender,"  Duh! Gee, Bender, how you gonna get through these bars?  I dunno, moron, suppose I bend them?  Duh, OK!
",1067738,Girl," Mommy! Mommy! Santa's through the perimeter!
",467739,Mrs. Grant," This is it, kids. Take your suicide pills so you won't suffer.
",647740,Bender," No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got toys ... at very reasonable prices!
",767741,Jeffery," Don't listen to him. He's the father of all lies and the uncle of all tricks!
",797742,Bender," But I come bearing Tri-ominos!
",327743,Mrs. Grant," Go for the shins!
",197744,Bender,"  One down...
",147745,Petunia," Well, hello there, handsome!  Won't you have a cookie?
",567746,Bender," Uh, don't mind if I do.  Ow! What's in these things?
",547747,Petunia," Why don't you slip into something more fiery?
",477748,Bender," Ow!
",57749,Kwanzaabot," Yo, Kringle! What happened to you, doll?
",427750,Bender," Oh, it's awful, Kwanzaabot. Everyone hates me.
",487751,Kwanzaabot," At least they understand you, you know what I'm sayin'? Ain't nobody down with this Kwanzaa tip.
",987752,Bender," Hey! Maybe you could lend me a hand with these deliveries.
",607753,Kwanzaabot," No time! I gotta hand out the traditional Kwanzaa book.  I've been givin' these out for 647 years!
",1007754,Fry," Ah! Bathtub eggnog! Just the way Grandma used to drink.  Ew! It went sour!
",767755,Zoidberg," Can't I have a scented bath in peace?
",397756,Leela," Remember, Professor, Bender is Santa. So we don't need to hurt him, right?
",767757,Farnsworth," Yes, yes, yes. You sound like a broken mp3!
",457758,Bender," Ho, ho--  Ow!
",157759,Leela,"  Professor! Don't you remember what I told you?
",497760,Farnsworth,"  No!
",67761,Bender,"  Oh, there's gotta be a better way.
",377762,Bender," Bender, you're a genius!
",267763,Vyolet," This creates an unrealistic standard of beauty!
",497764,Bender," Now it's time for Santa to screw open his present!
",527765,Smitty," It's Santa! And we got him cornered!
",387766,URL," Aw, I smell a juicy promotion for me.
",397767,Smitty," And a juicy re-hiring-back-onto-the-force for me!
",517768,Bailiff," This Xmas Day session of court will come to order. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding.
",917769,Whitey," Santa Claus, you stand accused of crimes against humanity. How do you plead?
",787770,Bender," Not Santa!
",127771,Farnsworth," There he is again!
",207772,Hyper-Chicken," Now, Pramala, I know it's scary in that there witness box but t'ain't no need to fear me.  I'm sorry, I thought you was corn. Now, would you please point at that robot over there.  No further questions.  Daddy done good, huh?
",2277773,Bender," Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
",597774,Pramala," Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.
",437775,Bender," And yet you haven't said what I told you to say. How can any of us trust you?
",797776,Whitey," Quit badgering the witness!
",297777,Hyper-Chicken," Badger? Where?
",167778,Whitey," Whereas I have a ham dinner with mayonnaise waiting for me at my mansion, I find the defendant guilty.  Santa Claus, I hereby sentence you to be executed at sundown.
",1677779,Leela," It's not fair. I just hope that dumb chicken is ashamed of himself.
",697780,Smitty," Deactivated robot walking. We got a deactivated robot walking here.
",697781,Robot #1," Hey, Santa, when you see the Robot Devil, tell him I'm-a comin'!
",667782,Bender," Hey, that guy said to tell you that--
",397783,Robot #1 Devil," I heard him!
",147784,Aide #1," Greetings, masters. My companion and I made lots of toys.
",597785,Leela," Outta my way, shrimp-oh. We're here to bring Santa back so we can prove Bender's innocent.
",927786,Santa," Do what you will. But we'll see who has the last ho.
",547787,Leela," There.
",87788,Fry," Oh, no! The ice is melting!
",297789,Leela," The pollution from the factory! It caused a greenhouse effect.
",647790,Aide #1," That would explain this heat.
",317791,Fry," And your breezy short-shorts!
",317792,Aide #2," Uh, yeah! That would explain it.
",347793,Fry," Hurry! We've gotta think of another way to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!
",807794,Leela," Especially for Bender.
",247795,Santa," Look out, Earth. I'm dreaming of a red Xmas.
",467796,Poopenmeyer," Ah, good old Maggie!  Eh? When I pull this switch, these powerful electromagnets will tear you limb-from-limb, killing you in the most humane possible manner.
",1607797,Bender," But, Mr. Mayor, that doesn't sound humane.
",447798,Poopenmeyer," It is for the witnesses because it's not boring!  The instant this random number generator reaches zero, you'll be executed.
",1267799,Bender," Aw!
",57800,Poopenmeyer," Ten. Three. Twelve. Three again.
",347801,Leela," Stop the execution!
",217802,Bender," Leela!
",87803,Poopenmeyer," Fifteen. Negative eight.
",267804,Leela," You got the wrong Santa. And I'll prove it.
",457805,Fry," I'm Santa Claus!
",187806,Poopenmeyer," What? Twenty-seven.
",217807,Hermes," No. I'm Santa Claus.
",227808,Poopenmeyer," Six.
",67809,Amy,"  We're also Santa Claus.
",267810,Zoidberg," And I'm his friend Jesus!
",277811,Fry," Your Mayor-ness, if you execute him, you have to execute all of us.
",697812,Poopenmeyer," You people aren't Santa. You're not even robots! Ninety-one. How dare you lie in front of Jesus!  Hey! Zero!
",1107813,Bender," No! Not the magnets!   Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home.  Swing low, sweet...
",1007814,Fry," This is horrible.
",197815,Farnsworth," But it's not boring!
",227816,Santa," Ho, ho, ho!
",137817,Poopenmeyer," My God! The real Santa! Get him, Jesus!
",417818,Zoidberg," I help those who help themselves.
",357819,Bender," Santa! You saved my life. Please don't kill me!
",497820,Santa," I'm not here to kill you, Bender! I need you to help me save Xmas.
",687821,Bender," Gee whiz, Santa! You want me to help you?
",437822,Fry," Don't do it! He's evil!
",257823,Santa," I know he is but I have no choice. I'm running late and if I don't complete my brutal rampage, well, it just wouldn't be Xmas. I guess what I'm asking is: Bender, won't you join my slaying tonight?
",1997824,Bender," Well ... 'tis the season!
",277825,Man #1," My hair!
",107826,Woman #1," My wedding cake!
",187827,Santa," Let it snow!
",147828,Bender," Merry Xmas, kids!
",197829,Leela," This wangs chun! After all the good we tried to do, Xmas turned out as rotten as ever.
",887830,Farnsworth," No heat.
",107831,Amy," No power.
",117832,Hermes," Huddled together in fear like lice in a burning wig.
",547833,Fry," Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all.
",707834,Leela," What are you talking about, you crouton? You said it yourself: Xmas should be about bringing people together, not blowing them apart.
",1357835,Fry," But don't you see? Fear has brought us together. That's the magic of Xmas!
",767836,Farnsworth," That's a big crock of--  Hold me!
",357837,Bender," On, Trasher! On, Smasher!  Hey, Kwanzaabot, where you off to?
",637838,Kwanzaabot," Ah, you didn't hear about it? Chanukah Zombie's having a luau at the B'nai B'rith! You comin'?
",967839,Bender," Word!
",77840,Santa," By the way, Bender, here's a small token of my appreciation for being Santa while I was trapped in the ice.
",1097841,Bender," Hey, chief, you screwed up. There's nothing in here.
",547842,Santa," Oh, it might appear empty but the message is clear: Play Santa again and I'll kill you next year!  Ho, ho, ho!
",1127843,Doctor," Push, Mrs. Fry. You're almost there.
",387844,Mr. Fry," You can do it, honey! Squeeze one out for America.
",527845,Mrs. Fry,"  Hey, keep it down! It's the 9th inning.
",427846,Commentator,"  Here's the 02 pitch to Craypool. He's taking all the way for a called strike three!
",867847,Mrs. Fry," Swing the bat, you bum!
",257848,Doctor," It's a boy. And look at that red hair!
",407849,Mr. Fry," You sayin' my son's a commie?
",317850,Commentator,"  And Grote leans into the pitch. It hits him! The Mets win!
",617851,Mrs. Fry," This is the happiest day of my life!
",387852,Doctor," Here's your baby, ma'am.
",267853,Mrs. Fry," Yeah, OK, thanks.
",197854,Mr. Fry," So, what should we name him?
",307855,Mrs. Fry," Uh, you pick. I picked dinner last night.
",437856,Mr. Fry," Well, I was thinking of Philip. After those screwdrivers?
",597857,Mrs. Fry," That's a fantastic idea. More morphine, please.
",497858,Mr. Fry," Look, Yancy, it's your baby brother, Philip.
",467859,Yancy," I wanna be named Philip! Me Philip! Me Philip!
",487860,Mr. Fry," Son, your name is Yancy, just like me and my grandfather and so on. All the way back to minuteman Yancy Fry, who blasted commies in the American Revolution.  Philip, until I find a suitable model of an ICBM, you'll have to make do learnin' to fear this toy spacecraft.
",2707861,Yancy," Mine! Mine!
",137862,Fry,"  C'mon!
",97863,Hermes,"  Baby needs a new pair of shoes!
",347864,Zoidberg," To hell with your spoiled baby! I need those shoes!
",537865,Announcer #1,"  And it's a dead heat! They're checking the electron microscope. And the winner is ...  ... number 3, in a quantum finish.
",1247866,Farnsworth," No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it.
",517867,Leela," How'd you do, Fry?
",207868,Fry," I'll tell you when my horse finishes ... bad.
",477869,Leo," In today's field we own four horses and two jockeys.
",547870,Mrs. Wong," We just put our best jockey out to stud, Amy. He's perfect for you!
",697871,Jockey," Hey, baby! Ever do it in a suitcase?
",387872,Bender," Ooh! Look! It's the Centaur race.
",357873,Fry," Come on! Come on! Hey, Leela, how about a kiss for good luck?  I meant tongue luck.
",857874,Announcer #1,"  And the winner is number four -- Steven.
",437875,Fry," I am so unlucky! I've run over black cats that were luckier than me.
",707876,Paper-hatted salesman,"  Get your piping-hot horse burgers, horse fries, horse cake and shakes. We got tongue straight from the horse's mouth.
",1207877,Leela," Hmm.
",67878,Hermes," It all sounds good.
",217879,Paper-hatted salesman," All our horses are 100% horse-fed for that double-horse juiced-in goodness.
",777880,Leela," I'll have the cholesterol-free omelette with horse beaters.
",617881,Paper-hatted salesman," And you, sir, how can I horse you?
",367882,Hermes," I'll have a horse coke.
",257883,Paper-hatted salesman," Horse Pepsi OK?
",177884,Hermes," Nay.
",67885,Jockey," Hey! What are you doing?
",267886,Bender," This.
",77887,Fry," Dear Horse God, I know I don't usually pray to you. Sometimes I doubt you even exist. But if you're willing to grant me luck, please, stamp your hoof once.  Come on, number six! Move it!  Don't do that! What are you--  Man, it's contagious!
",2427888,Announcer #1,"  And the winner is Harry Trotter by the entire racetrack.
",597889,Bender," That'll teach those other horses to take drugs!
",497890,Fry," That's it! You can only take my money for so long before you take it all, and I say enough.  I've got one dollar left, and this one I'm holding on to!  Oh, no you don't!  I may not know much about horses but I know a lot about doing anything for one dollar!  If you think bad luck can defeat me then you don't know my name is Philip J.--
",3397891,Paper-hatted salesman," That is one unlucky guy!
",267892,Fry," Kareem's got the sky hook but Philip J. Fry's got the space hook!
",677893,Yancy," Yancy drives; he goes up with his patented space hook!
",567894,Fry," Hey! That's my patented space hook! You stole it!
",517895,Yancy," You're not the president of it!
",337896,Fry," Holy camolie! A seven-leaf clover!
",367897,Yancy,"  I'm dying of old age!
",247898,Fry," Game over! Phil wins! Yancy's fans are stunned! There'll be no celebration at the Yancy-dome!
",957899,Yancy," Lucky.
",87900,Leela," Well, someone's in a good mode.
",337901,Bender," Let's just say I lucked-out at the track! Also, I rigged one race.
",687902,Fry," Pah! I'd have won a lot of money too if I still had my lucky seven-leaf clover. Plus I'd still have my hair.
",1107903,Hairbot," I got your page, Mr. Fry. Your new hair is ready.
",517904,Amy," So whatever happened to this seven-leaf clover?
",497905,Fry," I hid it in a secret hiding place whose location I never told anyone. Not even Scruffy.
",897906,Zoidberg," So the clover is still in the hiding place, maybe?
",527907,Fry," Hey, yeah! Maybe it is still there. Underground in the ruins of Old New York, helping some ant defeat another ant or helping some piece of dirt turn its luck around.
",1677908,Farnsworth," Dirt doesn't need luck.
",257909,Fry," I'm going down there to get my clover back. Some of the tunnels have metal bars so I'll need someone who's good at bending. Leela, how 'bout you?
",1477910,Leela," Sure. I'll do it.
",197911,Bender," Like hell you will! Bending's my middle name.
",477912,Fry," It is?
",87913,Bender," Yep. My full name is Bender Bending RodrÃ_guez.
",487914,Fry," Here's the entrance.  From this moment on, I declare my bad luck officially over.
",837915,Bender," He was fun.
",137916,Leela," Well, if we get bored looking for the clover, I've got Tetris on this thing.
",787917,Fry," Look, up ahead.
",177918,Bender," Old New York: The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas.
",617919,Fry," Wow! We've got Manhattan all to ourselves! I can finally do all the crazy stuff I always dreamed of doing.   Howard Stern is overrated!  Uh, oops!
",1487920,Bender," New York is so burned.
",247921,Fry," And remember when Mayor Giuliani cracked down on jaywalking?
",627922,Leela," No.
",57923,Fry," Well, Rudy, how do you like this action?
",427924,Teen #1," As you know, the big breakdance is Saturday. So if we wanna win those Jam Master J autographed parachute pants, our crew has to pop, lock and bust the freshest. Noticeably F.A.T., drop us a beat.  Name?
",2047925,Fry," Cosmic F.
",117926,Teen #1," Style?
",87927,Fry," Outer space.
",147928,Teen #1," Special moves?
",167929,Fry,"  The moonwalk ... the robot ... the zero G.
",457930,Teen #1," Name?
",77931,Yancy," Cosmic Y.
",117932,Teen #1," Style?
",87933,Yancy," Uh, deep space!
",177934,Fry," Deep space?
",137935,Teen #1," Special moves?
",167936,Yancy," The spacewalk...
",187937,Fry," Hey!
",67938,Yancy," The robot...
",147939,Fry," The robot? That's similar to mine!
",367940,Yancy," The zero G.
",137941,Fry," What are you doing? You totally ripped off my routine.
",567942,Yancy," You callin' me a biter?
",257943,Fry," Why do you always have to steal everything from me, Yancy? Find your own life and live it.
",927944,Yancy," Stop illin'! Word!
",207945,Fry," Well I'd like to see you try and steal this. The septuple-head-spin.
",707946,Yancy," He's just scratching. No one's ever done more than a quadruple.
",657947,Fry," Oh, yeah? Noticeably F.A.T., rewind the tape.
",477948,Teen #1," Crazy sucker!
",157949,Teen #2," Phil, you're hot!
",197950,Noticeably F.A.T.," That was ice cold, bro!
",257951,Teen #1," Fry, if I ever see you try anything that crazy again, this crew might just have some new parachute pants!
",1077952,Yancy," Stop hogging the clover.
",267953,Fry," Alright, team, let's go find that clover!
",437954,Leela," Which way to your house? The sign says we're at 71st Street.
",627955,Fry," 71st Street? Hmm, never heard of it. Downtown could be in any direction.
",747956,Bender," No sweat. We'll just take a spin on the B-train!
",507957,Bender," Ooh! That feels funny!  This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train making local stops at wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors.
",1427958,Bender," Wake up, buddy. End of the line!
",347959,Fry," Gosh! My old neighbourhood.  That's the bench where I found some shirts! That fire hydrant! In summer we'd light it on fire! On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter!
",2057960,Bender," Was it poorly Xeroxed?
",247961,Fry," You'd better believe it!
",267962,Leela," The old comedians were right, this place is a lot different from L.A.
",717963,Mutant #1," Pardon me, but did I overhear you saying you used to live here?
",657964,Fry," That's right.
",157965,Mutant #1," Did you know Andy Goldman?
",287966,Fry," Yeah, he was my neighbour. Why?
",337967,Mutant #1," I mutated from him!
",217968,Fry," Get outta here! What's Andy up to these days?
",477969,Andy," The short answer is I'm teaching.
",357970,Leela," He seemed nice.
",177971,Fry," Sure. When he's sober!
",247972,Fry," Holy camolies! The house I grew up in. It's still there!
",587973,Bender," Man, Father Time really took a bat to this place.
",517974,Yancy," That stupid clover is a worthless piece of garbage! Give it! Give it! Give it!
",807975,Fry,"  Mom! Help!
",137976,Mrs. Fry," Yes!
",67977,Fry," Mom, Yancy's trying to steal my clover.
",417978,Mrs. Fry,"  Yancy, stealing is wrong.
",287979,Yancy," Come back here, you! I'm gonna pile drive you!  You're dead meat!
",677980,Mr. Fry," What's happenin' up there? Did Kremlin Joe let fly with the nukes?
",687981,Fry," Not yet, commander. Yancy's just trying to steal my stuff as usual.
",697982,Mr. Fry," Well he'd better keep his hands off these bananas. Gonna need them when the radiation turns us all into monkeys.
",1147983,Fry," The Ronco Record Vault! Yancy'll never get his hands on you in here or my money back.  Ah, The Breakfast Club soundtrack. Man, I can't wait till I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff.  Stay safe, clover. I may need you again someday.
",2377984,Fry," This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter.
",797985,Leela," And yet you guys never had a single nuclear war.
",507986,Bender," What a waste.
",157987,Fry," This is it. My Ronco Record Vault.  I still remember the combination: Three.  It's stuck!
",917988,Bender," The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is its structural resonance frequency. Allow me.  There we go!
",1027989,Fry," Here it is. The Breakfast Club soundtrack.
",447990,Bender," You mean ""breakfast club sandwich""?
",377991,Fry," I hid my seven-leaf clover in this very record jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn't get it.  Here goes.  It's gone!  The whole place has been cleaned out! Yancy stole my clover! That thief!
",1907992,Leela," How do you know it didn't disintegrate?
",417993,Fry," Everything else in here held up OK.
",377994,Bender," Except Sports by Huey Lewis.
",307995,Fry," I don't know why my brother hated me so much.
",477996,Leela," Oh, brothers always fight. I'm sure deep down he loved you. He just never got a chance to say it before you got frozen.
",1217997,Fry," You think? 'Cause I always kinda wished that--
",487998,Bender," Who is that God-like figure?
",307999,Fry," It's my brother, Yancy! And there, in his lapel, my seven-leaf clover! I knew he stole it.
",928000,Leela," Hold the phone. If that's Yancy, why does the inscription say Philip J. Fry?
",788001,Fry," Wait a second. That's my name! Good Lord. He ditched his goofy name and stole mine!
",858002,Bender," Apparently this brave Adonis, this Cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars.
",838003,Fry," First person on Mars? I should have been the first person on Mars. He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life.  And now he broke my hand!
",1548004,Bender," His legend lives on.
",228005,Farnsworth," So you opened the record vault and the clover was gone?
",578006,Bender," Yep. Nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980's in one amazing collection.
",878007,Leela," Survivor, Pat Benatar, The Scorpions. The list goes on.
",578008,Fry," That clover helped my ratfink brother steal my dream of going into space. Now I'll never get there.
",1018009,Leela," You went there this morning for doughnuts.
",448010,Hermes," First person on Mars? Oh, so your brother was that Philip J. Fry.
",678011,Fry," I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name after I got frozen.
",578012,Farnsworth," Shut up, friends. My Internet browser heard us saying the word ""Fry"" and it found a movie about Philip J. Fry for us.  It also opened my calendar to Friday and ordered me some French fries.
",1918013,Narrator,"  Philip J. Fry: Astronaut, philanthropist, entrepreneur was a great man truly worthy of narration. Fry was the first man on Mars ...  ... a feat that has never since been equalled.
",1828014,Fry," That should have been me!
",278015,Narrator,"  The ever-lucky Fry made his fortune after striking oil in the bathroom of the mansion he had won in a lottery.
",1138016,Fry," That's my clover! Yancy stole it!
",358017,Narrator,"  After a whirlwind fling with Icelandic supermodel NjÃ¶rd, Fry scored a string of top 10 hits with his rock band Leaf Seven, known for their hypnotic rhythms, driving baselines and memorable hooks.
",1988018,Fry," That's what I'm known for!
",288019,Man #1,"  Phil came in, right, strummed out this tune, yeah, and I said, ""That's a number one record!""
",958020,Narrator,"  Today, Fry spends most of his time in his grave in Orbiting Meadows National Cemetery, buried with the trademark seven-leaf clover that will bring him luck in the next life, perhaps some Egyptians believe.
",2088021,Fry," So that's where my clover is? Hey, is that orbiting cemetery near here?
",738022,Leela," It will be in a couple hours.
",318023,Fry," Good. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.
",498024,Bender," I'll get my kit.
",188025,Yancy," Thanks for lending me your tux, Dad. It'll be perfect for my wedding.
",718026,Mr. Fry," Yancy, that tux got me through 'Nam in style.  I just wish your brother were still around to see this.
",1048027,Mrs. Fry," I'll never forget the day Philip disappeared. Wisconsin won the Rose Bowl 17-9. Oh, I miss him.
",978028,Yancy," Oh, that reminds me: I was thinking I'd rummage through Phil's records for something to play at the wedding.
",1108029,Mrs. Fry," Have a look downstairs. Your brother may be missing but his crap sure isn't.
",788030,Yancy," Hmm, Breakfast Club. This'll clear out the room at the end of the reception.
",788031,Leela," They buried your brother in the World Heroes section? I'm impressed.
",708032,Fry," I should be the one in that grave!
",368033,Fry," Hmm. We lost Bender.
",228034,Bender," There! Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine.
",778035,Fry," Aha! My brother's grave!
",268036,Leela,"  Philip Fry, the original Martian.
",368037,Fry," It's all lies, every word of it! He wasn't original, he wasn't a Martian, he wasn't Philip Fry and since when is he a the?
",1248038,Bender," You're twice the the he ever was.
",358039,Fry," It's clovering time!
",228040,Yancys wife," So, had any ideas for names, Yancy?
",378041,Yancy," Uh, I'm sorta thinking one.  Daddy has a present for you today. Do you know what it is?  It's a lucky clover that can help you be successful whatever you do -- even breakdancing -- and it once belonged to someone very special.
",2288042,Yancys wife," I know what name you wanna give him Yancy. It's OK.
",538043,Yancy," Really?  Son, I'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honour of my little brother, who I miss every day. I love you, Philip, and I always will.
",1378044,Fry,"  Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle to carry on his spirit.
",718045,Bender," Pay dirt! I got the clover! Plus his wedding ring.  Sorry, ladies, I'm taken! Hey, Fry, you want me to smack the corpse up a little?
",1348046,Leela," Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone.
",478047,Bender," Alright, grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
",768048,Leela," Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious but they produce an awful lot of trash.
",878049,Bender," Ah!
",58050,Leela," And, Bender, that aerosol head spray makes your antenna smell nice--
",708051,Bender," Thank you.
",128052,Leela," But it's doing long-term damage to the planet.
",488053,Bender," So? It's not like it's the only one we've got.
",488054,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I'm sending you on an extremely controversial mission.
",778055,Fry," Controversial?
",168056,Farnsworth," Oh, my, no.
",138057,Farnsworth," For this highly controversial mission you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an orbiting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter.
",1338058,Leela," Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak.
",678059,Farnsworth," Impossible!  The tanker has 6,000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof.  Now, once you've hauled the tanker past the protestors--
",1418060,Leela," Protestors?
",138061,Farnsworth," Correct. 6,000 hulls.
",238062,Leela," Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto?
",768063,Farnsworth,"  To avoid the tollbooth.
",268064,Fry," OK, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going.
",628065,Leela," At the risk of sounding negative: No! Look, Professor, I can't participate in this mission.
",938066,Farnsworth," What are you yapping about?
",298067,Leela," This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna go join those protestors.
",1068068,Farnsworth," This is an outrage! I demand you hand over your captain's jacket.
",678069,Leela," This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.
",538070,Farnsworth," I said hand it over!  Well, Fry, or should I say Captain Fry?  No, I shouldn't. Because Bender is the new captain!
",1168071,Fry," Bender?
",98072,Farnsworth," That's right. Being captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job.
",1538073,Bender," Well, I do think of human life as expendable.
",478074,Fry," No fair! Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer -- in this comic I drew.
",1138075,Zoidberg," Ooh! The new one's out!
",258076,Bender," Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic.  Now look spry, men! We launch at six bells!
",1528077,Waterfall Sr.," Greetings, Econauts. I'm Free Waterfall Sr., founder of Penguins Unlimited.  Whoa! No, no! No applause. Every time you clap your hands you kill thousands of spores that'll some day form a nutritious fungus. Just show your approval with a mould-friendly thumbs up.  Please hold your thumbs until the end. Now, folks, it's time to stop that tanker with a non-violent human circle.
",3808078,Leela,"  Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?
",768079,Waterfall Sr.," Now, little lady, those people's asses are living things too.
",638080,Bender," Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease, men.
",708081,Fry," I am at ease.
",158082,Bender," Mr. Fry, I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on you will be known as ... Wiggles!
",1078083,Fry," The hell I will! Have you even read the Captain's Handbook?
",618084,Bender," I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?
",658085,Fry," Always respect the chain o' command ... captain.
",508086,Bender," Correct, Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table
",758087,Zoidberg,"  The captain's table! What an honour!
",398088,Waterfall Sr.," Our peace ring has 'em trapped like a tiger in a washing machine!
",678089,Leela," Get ready!
",128090,Protestor #1," Look out!
",118091,Protestor #2," Hold on!
",108092,Waterfall Sr.," Here they come!
",178093,Leela," When you were planning this peace ring, didn't you realise spaceships can move in three dimensions?
",1018094,Waterfall Sr.," No, I did not.
",168095,Waterfall Sr.," Folks, that tanker gave us the slip, but we'll stop 'em here on Pluto. If you're cold, rub your bodies with permafrost. It's nature's long johns.  If rubbing frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey, I don't wanna be right!
",2258096,Waterfall Sr.," This here is our penguin preserve.
",368097,Leela," Aw! They're so cute! They're like if puppies and kittens could have babies!
",778098,Waterfall Sr.," We use hand puppets around the young'uns to simulate a natural environment.
",778099,Leela," That's adorable!
",188100,Bender," But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of, Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it.
",1838101,Zoidberg," Brilliant!
",128102,Fry," Would you cram a sock in it, Bender? Those aren't even medals, they're bottle-caps and pepperoni slices!
",1068103,Bender," Thank you, steward. Wiggles, weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?
",928104,Fry," Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender, he's the best ...  ... at being a big jerk who's stupid and his big, ugly face is as dumb as a butt.
",1458105,Bender," Eh, I've heard better.
",248106,Fry," If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.
",888107,Bender," Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!
",368108,Fry," Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.
",838109,Bender," Going? But a captain can't drink without his first mate.
",588110,Zoidberg," You can drink with me maybe?
",308111,Bender," I don't feel like drinking.
",298112,Zoidberg," Then, if you'll excuse me, I see some ravioli that only has two shoe prints on it.  Three.
",928113,Bender,"  Oh, Greenland is a barren land,
A land that bears no green,
Where there's ice and snow,
And the whale fishes blow,
And the--
",1278114,Zoidberg," Captain, please, have some liquor. You robots need alcohol to function.
",738115,Bender,"  Gah! I once knew a guy ... you look like him. But he wasn't either.  I'm a good captain.
",918116,Zoidberg," Please, sir, I love you like a father!
",408117,Protestor #3," Here they come. Oh, I hope they read my sign!
",478118,Leela," Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!
",488119,Protestor #3," He must be talking on a cell phone!
",378120,Fry," What's happening?
",198121,Zoidberg," All 6,000 hulls have been breached!
",378122,Fry," Oh, the fools! If only they'd built it with 6,001 hulls! When will they learn?
",808123,Linda,"  Continuing our coverage of a tragic  but far away  story. The crisis on Pluto worsens as dark matter spreads throughout the penguin habitat. The images are truly horrific.
",1748124,Leela,"  I don't think any of us can understand how those poor, oil-drenched penguins feel.
",858125,Morbo,"  Oily humanoid!  At the time of the crash, the tanker captain had an alcohol level of .08 percent -- well below the legal limit for robots.
",1418126,Hyper-Chicken," Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
",1758127,Bender," Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just got me the death penalty?
",668128,Hyper-Chicken," I'd have done better but it's plum hard pleadin' a case while awaitin' trial for that there incompetence!
",1078129,Bender," Yeah, uh, good luck with that.
",328130,Leela," Now you stay away from those puffin twins.
",448131,Waterfall Sr.," Good way to avoid frostbite, folks: Put your hands between your buttocks. That's nature's pocket.
",998132,Leela," Uh ... I think I'll go check on Bender.
",418133,Waterfall Sr.," Watch that he doesn't pick your pocket.
",418134,Bender," Ah, can't beat fresh-squeezed!
",328135,Leela," Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished?  And clean the black parts too.
",898136,Smitty," Are they black with white feathers or white with black feathers?
",668137,URL," It don't matter, baby, they're all beautiful!
",478138,Bender," Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here?  Oh, ho! What's this?
",588139,URL," Aw, man! He got away!
",238140,Smitty," I guess this is why Chief says no hugging.
",448141,Waterfall Sr.," Good work, everyone. I suggest you all go get some sleep. Me, well, I'm gonna stay up all night singing songs about penguins in a fine, piercing tenor.
",1538142,Leela," Has anyone seen Bender?  Bender?  Here robot, robot, robot.
",618143,Leela," Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?
",568144,Zoidberg," They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job.   And eating penguin eggs.
",818145,Fry," You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other planet?
",908146,Zoidberg," Damnit, Fry! He may have done wrong, but he's still your captain.
",678147,Leela," I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group.
",608148,Fry," He didn't?
",128149,Leela," No, and with wind-chill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him.
",868150,Fry," Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means.  To the ship.
",1308151,Leela," Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.
",648152,Fry," Madam, I am in command now.
",298153,Zoidberg," Such a man! I'd follow him to hell and back, I would.
",558154,Bender," What the--?  What's this water made of, ice? Forget this!
",598155,Penguin #1,"  Full of fish?
",168156,Bender,"  Not entirely.
",168157,Penguin #1,"  Then let's fish.
",198158,Zoidberg," Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto any longer. In fact, we may have left space as we know it.
",988159,Fry," Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate.
",558160,Zoidberg,"  Stop yelling at me!
",228161,Waterfall Sr.," Folks, it's worse than we thought. Seems dark matter is nature's sex drug. It's like a perverted trail mix of penguin oestrogen, penguin Viagra and Spanish penguin fly. Why, it's making them ultra-fertile.
",2078162,Leela," How ultra?
",128163,Waterfall Sr.," Well your garden variety penguin lays one egg a year. Since the spill our penguins have been laying six eggs every 15 minutes.  Also, the eggs hatch in only 12 hours.  Also, the males are laying eggs.
",2028164,Doctor," This man is over-gasped.
",268165,Waterfall Sr.," If the birds keep multiplying there'll soon be too many to count.  Before long the penguins will exhaust their food supply and starve to death.
",1458166,Leela," Oh, if only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this might never have happened. Can't we stop them from multiplying?
",1408167,Waterfall Sr.," Yes, I reckon it is our responsibility. And thankfully we have a plan.
",728168,Leela," What is it? We'll do anything.
",328169,Waterfall Sr.," Everyone, grab your guns. I declare penguin hunting season officially open.
",778170,Leela," You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there some way to keep them from breeding?
",768171,Waterfall Sr.," Cold showers don't work on Antarctic creatures. Now surely you agree that a quick, semi-painless death is a damn sight better than weeks of starvation.
",1538172,Leela," Well, I suppose... But-- I mean-- I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, not to hunt them.
",998173,Waterfall Sr.," This time the two are one and the same! Now are you with us or are you gonna let innocent penguins suffer?
",1088174,Leela,"  Oh, God! It's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!
",588175,Waterfall Sr.," That's a good old-fashioned gun. Simple point-and-click interface. Rifle check!
",818176,Hunter #1," Oh, yeah!
",118177,Hunter #2," Wee doggy!
",128178,Leela," Hey, you're enjoying this.
",288179,Waterfall Sr.," Look, nobody enjoys shooting penguins. But if you have to shoot penguins, well, you might as well enjoy it.
",1098180,Leela," I'm sorry, but if it's fun in any way it's not environmentalism.
",668181,Waterfall Sr.," Oh, really? How 'bout blowing up dams?
",408182,Leela," Yeah ... that is fun.
",238183,Waterfall Sr.," Let's conservate!
",198184,Zoidberg,"  It's been an honour to serve under you, sir!
",478185,Leela," Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families.  But they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering a little butler. I-I can't look.   Oh, no! What have I done?  Oh, you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I-- Bender?  Bend. 2] Cheese It! He stands up and takes the bullet out of his head. Leela stops crying.] What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?
",4218186,Bender," Of course not. Filthy ice rats! Scat! Shoo!  Gah! What are you doing? Get away!
",818187,Leela," Aw! They love you!
",208188,Bender," Well I don't love them.  Aw!  I don't know why but when I look down at their little faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!
",1318189,Penguins,"  Stand still. It's our only hope.
",358190,Bender,"  That's puffin talk. Now follow me!
",378191,Leela," Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela.
",388192,Hunter #2," Sorry.
",88193,Waterfall Sr.," Why aren't you firing randomly into those birds, little lady? Don't you wanna help 'em?
",898194,Leela," Not this way.
",158195,Waterfall Sr.," What? Why you're not a tree-hugging kook at all!
",508196,Leela," Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not. But I do know the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who just wanna kill for fun.
",1678197,Waterfall Sr.," Leela, you may just be farming some free-range truth there.  On the other hand, we already made up 200 pounds of batter for penguin tempura. OK, boys, it's them or us!
",1698198,Leela," No!
",58199,Waterfall Sr.," Hey! Where'd they--
",218200,Bender,"  Attack!
",108201,Hunter #1," Whoa!
",78202,Hunter #2," Ow!
",58203,Bender,"  We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!
",738204,Waterfall Sr.,"  Make sure they use every part of my body!
",448205,Old Man #1 Waterfall,"  I'll avenge your death, son!
",318206,Leela," They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.
",698207,Bender," Yep. It's like I taught 'em: If it ain't black and white, peck scratch and bite! Now to take off my tuxedo.  Guys, it's me! Your lovable dictator! Uh-oh!
",1558208,Leela," Oh, if only we had a toboggan.
",328209,Bender," Faster! Faster!
",178210,Leela," Phew!
",78211,Bender," Oh, phew!  Oh, right, they can swim. It's all coming back to me now.
",708212,Leela," It's Fry!
",118213,Bender," Wiggles?
",108214,Leela," Well, at least it'll help reduce their population.
",528215,Bender," Yeah, life is hilariously cruel.  Permission to come aboard, Wiggles?
",718216,Fry," Granted. We can't take off without our captain.
",498217,Bender," Oh, and bring my toboggan.
",288218,Fry," So, Leela, were you able to help the penguins?
",488219,Leela," Well, sure. I mean ... not really. I mean ... nature will work itself out. It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things, right?
",1528220,Fry,"  I 'unno.
",118221,Bender," Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birds'll do just fine.
",928222,Leela," Guidance system?
",188223,Bender," Online.
",98224,Leela," Autopilot?
",128225,Autopilot," Present.
",108226,Leela," Dark matter indicator?
",248227,Fry," Making the noise.
",198228,Leela," All systems operational. Let's rock!
",388229,Leela," Gentlemen, I've completed my report on the crash.
",518230,Bender," Whoa! I'm not reading that crap. Summarise it in one word.
",608231,Leela," Sabotage.  This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is but the fevered dream of a madman.
",1008232,Fry," Yep.
",68233,Bender," Of course.
",128234,Zoidberg," Doy!
",68235,Hermes," It's an important unit.
",258236,Leela," And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship.
",678237,Fry," That doesn't look like an ""L"" at all. Unless you count lowercase.
",678238,Bender," You know we don't!
",208239,Leela," Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.
",718240,Bender," Hmm. It should look like this.  But instead it looks like this.
",658241,Fry," Who would do a thing like that?
",338242,Bender," Who could do a thing like that? And by ""that"", I mean this.
",618243,Zoidberg," Well, gang, it looks like we have another mystery on our hands.
",658244,Hermes," I'd better make a chart of the suspects. I'll begin by drawing a line with my straight-edge.  Sweet lamprey of Santa Fe! My edge has been bent!
",1458245,Amy,"  My javelin too! It's ruined.  Now we'll never beat Jupiter State.
",688246,Zoidberg," My slinky!  My cuddly, little pet slinky!
",438247,Farnsworth," What's all the hubbub?
",248248,Leela," My God! Even the Professor's been bent.
",418249,Farnsworth," That you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum.
",578250,Bender," I'll get you fixed up.  That's fine.
",388251,Amy," Wait a minute. Bender, what did you just do to the Professor?
",638252,Bender," I bent him.
",138253,Amy," Aha!
",68254,Hermes," Bender!
",98255,Zoidberg," J'accuse!
",118256,Bender," Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending.
",858257,Hermes," I know how to settle this: We'll check last night's surveillance tapes.
",738258,Fry," Huh?
",68259,Amy," What tapes?
",138260,Leela," Surveillance?
",158261,Zoidberg," You've seen me naked?
",238262,Hermes," Ah. Last night's tape. It was right next to Bathroom Bloopers 4.
",668263,Bender," See? Nothing. Told you, losers.
",338264,Fry," Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are.
",518265,Bender," I'm sleepwalking.
",198266,Farnsworth," Dear God! We've got robots on the ceiling.
",448267,Fry," You weren't sleepwalking, you were sleep-bending!
",518268,Bender," This is quite a shock. On the other hand, it's not surprising in the least. After all, I've been bending since the day I was built.
",1338269,Bender,"  I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.
",618270,Bender," Mama.  Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending.
",988271,Amy," You remember your own birth?
",308272,Bender," Sure. It was only four years ago.
",358273,Fry," You're only four years old?
",298274,Bender," Precocious little scamp, ain't I?
",358275,Leela," Hmm. Bender must have a pent-up need to bend that's not being satisfied by his bend-free lifestyle.
",1018276,Farnsworth," Then he can't stay here. He's a menace to every straight person in the company.  Go satisfy your bend lust and don't you come back to work until you do.
",1548277,Robot #1s,"  No more bending, no more work. Give us a raise, you big fat jerk.
",688278,Sal,"  Nevers!
",108279,Joey," Yo! The Mafia supports you. But don't tell no one. Spread the word.
",698280,Donbot," As the duly-elected mobsters of this union, it's our duty to support the struggle of these proud, lazy slobs.
",1118281,Joey," Yeah, but what if management remains intragnizent?
",528282,Donbot," From the context it is clear what you mean. In that case, Clamps may have a little surprise for them.
",1038283,Clamps," The clamps!   Right?
",228284,Bender," Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything. Oh, woe is Bender.
",758285,Robot #1 #1," Hang tough, brother. Management refused our demand to switch casual Friday to Monday.
",878286,Bender," What?
",78287,Robot #1 #2," And now they're hiring scabs at ten-times the normal wage.
",608288,Bender," Ten-times normal wage?  I'll give those jerks what for!
",578289,Sal," Welcomes aboard, scab.
",248290,Bender," Great to be here.
",198291,Sal," Come on. I'll introduces you to your scab co-workers you'll be scabbing with.  This here's our scab foreman.
",1108292,Bender," Flexo?
",88293,Flexo," Bender?
",98294,Bender," Hey, sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account of mistaken identity.
",1108295,Flexo," You bastard! They treated me like an animal and that's what I became!  Nah, you're alright. Good to see you, buddy!
",1178296,Sal," And here's another scab what also works here, Angle-ine.
",588297,Bender,"  Hello.
",98298,Sal," Hey, yous guyses wanna move that things?
",428299,Bender,"  Hello!
",98300,Robot #1s,"  Give us a raise, you big fat jerk.
",378301,Sal,"  Nevers!
",108302,Bender," Ow!  Um, hi, Angle-ine. Whatcha up to?
",408303,Angle-ine," Making hangers. Guidance counsellor said I had a knack for it.
",648304,Bender," That's cool, that's cool. So, um, uh, I was wondering if, y'know, it's cool if not, but, what are you doing after work?
",1218305,Angle-ine," What I always do. Jack squat.
",318306,Bender," Me too.  Man, we have a lot in common, huh?
",458307,Angle-ine," Well we are made of virtually identical components.
",538308,Bender,"  Are you sure? Maybe I should sneak a peek at your access panel.
",668309,Angle-ine," Hey, according to the scab handbook that's extremely inappropriate banter.  And that's just the way I like it.
",1128310,Hermes," Haile H. Selassie!
",208311,Zoidberg," There, little friend. Good as new.
",368312,Farnsworth," What an exquisite day. That azure sky, the verdant treetops.  Those delightful birds with their chirp, chirp, chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat.
",1488313,Fry," Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?
",778314,Farnsworth," Hmm. I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain, resulting in a mild delirium. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.
",2558315,Fry," I wish! It's a nickel.
",248316,Bender," Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera!
",688317,Bender," I bet watching me bend girders like this turns your legs all rubbery.
",718318,Angle-ine," Well my legs are made of rubber.  And anyway, I am just as strong as you are, Mac.
",848319,Bender," Oh, yeah?  Prove it.  Here, let me help you.
",468320,Farnsworth," My new bent outlook has completely re-energised me. I'm even dating a young Brazilian retired actress.
",1048321,Fry," Alright!
",108322,Farnsworth," Some say I'm robbing the cradle but I say she's robbing the grave.
",688323,Bender," Howdy, doodies. What's new?
",298324,Farnsworth," I was just regaling your former co-workers with a tale of bedroom antics, the likes of which--
",968325,Bender," Yeah, yeah! Big whoop! No one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm in love and I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate.
",1258326,Amy," Let's get liquored up!
",248327,Elzar," Hey, look at this crowd. You guys gotta try the pasta. It's got a real nice profit margin. Bam! So, special occasion tonight?
",1278328,Bender," Oh, Elzar, you'll never guess what's happened?
",488329,Elzar," Bam?
",68330,Bender," I met the most dynamite ladybot.
",348331,Elzar," Hey, that's terrific. To celebrate, I'm gonna stick seven copies of my latest cookbook on your bill.
",1028332,Bender," Bless you, sir.
",178333,Farnsworth," So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours.
",578334,Bender," I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast.  To Angle-ine, she's got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot.
",1378335,Fry," She sure does.
",168336,Bender," Flexo!
",88337,Elzar,"  Careful, that's a week old!
",308338,Bender," I finally meet a nice girl with a pair of legs that don't quit unexpectedly and that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, metal ass.  You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angle-ine.
",2188339,Angle-ine," Bender, it's-it's not what you think.
",398340,Bender," Oh, God! Then it's worse than I think.
",408341,Angle-ine," Now, look, there is no reason to be upset. Flexo and I are divorced.
",708342,Bender," Div-- Huh?
",128343,Flexo," We're just havin' dinner 'cause we wanna stay friends.
",568344,Bender," Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine. Really, it's the steward's fault.
",1068345,Steward," Excellent choice, sir.
",248346,Bender,"  That Flexo, I'm knockin' him right on his butt. I can't believe this.
",728347,Farnsworth," Obsessing won't help, Bender. Take a lean back and enjoy life.
",648348,Bender," I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot.
",568349,Leela," Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest way.
",748350,Fry," Yeah. Either that or be a man.
",328351,Bender," OK, I've constructed an elaborate lie: I'll call Angle-ine while pretending to be Flexo, arrange a date, show up disguised as him and catch her two-timing me with myself.
",1728352,Fry," That's thinkin' like a man.
",298353,Bender,"  Hello? This is Flexo.
",248354,Bender," Now we'll see who loves whom.
",318355,Bender," Hey, hot stuff.
",178356,Angle-ine," Hey, Flexo.  So since when do you go to bars on work nights? It's not like you at all.
",888357,Bender," Nonsense. It's exactly like me. Flexo: The fun-loving love machine Fembots love to love. Hey, barkeep, I'll have a Fuzzy Navel and she'll have the girliest drink in the house.
",1778358,Bartender-bot," Two Fuzzy Navel's comin' up.
",308359,Bender," I hope they can make change for a fortune.
",448360,Joey," Yo. Get an eye-load of that filthy scab with the beard flashing his filthy scab money. It's an insult to you, boss.
",1178361,Donbot," Yeah. That cash oughta be slushin' my fund and kicksing my back.
",668362,Clamps," I'm greasing up my whoozits!
",308363,Donbot," Whoa, whoa, Clamps, not yet. Let's just keep an eye on him and see if he does it a couple more times.
",1038364,Bender," You're lookin' good to Flexo tonight.
",398365,Angle-ine," Quit makin' with the googly eyes. You know that I'm in love with Bender.
",748366,Bender," Bender? That walking wuss factory?
",368367,Angle-ine," Well he may be a walking factory but believe me he is no wuss. Now, look, you and me are through. I told you that when I divorced you.
",1368368,Bender," But going through a divorce together, you can't tell me that didn't bring us closer. Care to dance?
",1018369,Angle-ine," You know I love dancing but you always hated it.
",508370,Bender," In that case it's something I've always wanted to make up to you.  Hey, scratchmo. How 'bout dropping me and the lady some rump-rattling beats?
",1458371,Donbot," I had hoped that by the second time he flashed his cash my rage would have subsided. Sadly that has not happened.
",1158372,Angle-ine," You used to be so inflexible, Flexo. You have really loosened up!
",678373,Bender," I recently upgraded my funk card. C'mon!
",428374,Angle-ine," Alright!
",108375,Bender," C'mon now, what's new!  Ew!
",298376,Angle-ine," Flexo? What-What's going on?
",308377,Bender," Um...
",78378,Angle-ine," Flexo!
",88379,Bender," So the moral of the story is: If you want it to stay sunk, tie a weight to it!
",808380,Angle-ine,"  You always were a kick in the teeth, man.
",448381,Bender," Aw, shucks, thunder-buns! You make me feel like a million volts.
",668382,Angle-ine," Flexo, Flexo, Flexo. I'm starting to remember why I fell for you in the first place.
",868383,Bender,"  So, she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a little more, just to be sure.
",898384,Angle-ine," Well, it's late. I should get home to my trailer.
",518385,Bender," I'll walk you out. After all, a true gentleman tends to his date's every need.  Tiparillo?
",928386,Bender," Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way possible.
",798387,Joey," He's flashin' his cash loaf again.
",368388,Donbot," How many times is that? Two or three?
",398389,Clamps," Three.
",88390,Donbot," Alright. That's the necessary number of times. That scab's gonna have a little on-the-job accident.
",1018391,Joey," With all due respect, Donbot, I don't think we should rely on an accident happening. Let's kill him ourselves.
",1128392,Angle-ine," Well, goodnight. I-I had a great time.
",408393,Bender," How 'bout a lift? To your place.
",348394,Angle-ine," What?
",78395,Bender," Admit it. You felt something for me tonight. And by ""me"" I mean Flexo.
",728396,Angle-ine," Hey, look, I had fun, but--
",298397,Bender," But?
",68398,Angle-ine," But--
",78399,Bender," But?
",68400,Angle-ine,"  But...  Huh? Bender! You tricked me.
",398401,Bender," That's right, baby. I ain't your lover boy, Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anybody pretending to be him.
",1228402,Angle-ine," Well maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you're pretending to be.
",818403,Bender," Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: Kill Flexo.  Ow!
",1198404,Angle-ine,"  Nooo!
",88405,Flexo," Thanks, I appreciate that.  Nah, I'm joshing you. That was quite annoying.
",768406,Bender," You call yourself divorced? You're making a mockery of one of our oldest institutions.
",888407,Flexo," What?
",78408,Clamps," Alright, boss, give the word and I'll drop this unbendable girder. Clamp, clamp, ka-bamp!
",918409,Donbot," Remember, only kill the one with the beard. That other filthy scab we got nothing against.
",928410,Flexo," That's low!
",138411,Angle-ine," Please stop! I'm not worth it!
",328412,Bender," Probably not. But I love you and I'm gonna kick his ass till I win you back.
",788413,Donbot,"  OK, Clamps. Now!
",198414,Clamps," Ooh, that's gotta clamp!
",268415,Angle-ine," Flexo? Are you OK?
",208416,Flexo," Yeah, never better.  Nah, I'm yankin' your chain, I'm dying.
",628417,Angle-ine," You can't die. Tonight Bender showed me that I love you.
",588418,Bender," But, I love you.
",188419,Angle-ine," I know and I care for you too. But I could never love anyone as much as you made me realise I love Flexo.
",1078420,Bender," But ... but...  I love you so much, Angle-ine, I want you to be happy no matter what.
",878421,Angle-ine," What, what are you saying?
",288422,Bender," I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder to bend.
",518423,Angle-ine," You can't bend that girder. It's unbendable!
",468424,Bender," Well I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the one option.
",828425,Flexo," Thanks, buddy. Another year under that and I'd have been a goner.
",678426,Angle-ine," I'll always remember this, Bender.
",368427,Bender,"  Me too. Me too.  Jerk.
",258428,Leela," So Flexo and Angle-ine had sex right there on the factory floor? Well, at least you got bending out of your system.
",1178429,Bender," Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time.
",608430,Farnsworth," Perhaps it's your outlook that needs a good bend. A 90-degree bend to a place where happiness is perpendicular to wonderment.
",1278431,Fry," Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat attitude.
",528432,Amy," I'll say.
",118433,Zoidberg," Believe it.
",138434,Farnsworth," Nonsense. It's just like in the song I wrote:
 We all need a new angle on life,
You gotta bend away all your trouble and your strife,
",1358435,Leela," Bender, you've gotta help us.
",318436,Bender," I try to get out but they keep pulling me back in.
",528437,Farnsworth,"  You gotta dangle,
Have a new angle,
Wangle a new dangle on life,
",678438,Amy," No, Bender! The other way.
",288439,Bender," I like him better this way.
",298440,Farnsworth," I'm sad now.
",148441,Leela," Eh, it's fine.
",168442,Amy," Is Nibbler stoked for the big pet show?
",418443,Leela," He ought to be with all the strict training I've been putting him through.  Nibbler, roll over and you get a ham.  Roll over. Roll over for the ham.  You are so adorable! Who wants a ham?
",1898444,Farnsworth," Zooka barooka! First prize is $500 and a year's supply of dog food!
",698445,Bender," ""$500"", you say?
",188446,Zoidberg," ""Dog food"", you say?
",228447,Fry," Man, that's dog's gonna be hard to beat. Look at him bring in the sheep! One sheep, two sheep ...  ... three sheep.
",1178448,Leela," The dog's good, but our real competition is the Hypno-Toad.  Your turn, Nibbler, honey. Herd those sheep!
",1078449,Amy," Come on, Nibbler!
",198450,Bender,"  Ma'am, I have a late entry: My hard-shelled wooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg.
",778451,Bender," Faster! Faster.
",178452,Zoidberg," Ow!
",58453,Bender," Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed?
",408454,Bender," Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!
",428455,Bender," I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!
",398456,Fry," I love these things!
",228457,Leela," Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake.  He might be a little hungry. Shake, boy. Usually he's had more ham by now. Shake!
",1218458,Judge #1 #1," Third prize, a party-sized keg of guinea pigs, goes to Dave Spiegel and his owner, Fluffers.  Second prize, this lovely afghan made from an Afghan, goes to Bender and his wooping terrier.
",1898459,Bender," Second place?  That's a fancy word for losing.  You didn't stick your landing!
",808460,Zoidberg," Forgive me, my friend.
",248461,Bender," Never!
",88462,Judge #1 #1," And before we announce the winner we have a special award for a first-time contestant: Ms. Leela and her mystery pet, Nibbler!
",1288463,Leela," Me? Award? Him? Me? Good?
",278464,Judge #1 #1," That's just the kind of eloquence you'd expect from the owner of Dumbest Pet in Show.  And the grand prize winner ...   ... the Hypno-Toad.  All glory to the Hypno-Toad.
",1718465,Leela," Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb.
",458466,Fry," Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them.
",738467,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 12 but it's been completely destroyed.
",1198468,Leela," Why is that good news?
",248469,Farnsworth," They paid in advance.
",238470,Bender," Excuse me.
",128471,Hermes," This is mighty strange.  First, the civilisation of Space Rome collapsed, then Don Martin 3 went kaflooie and now Tweenis 12.
",1278472,Fry,"  Looks like this planet is next in line.
",428473,Leela," That's Earth.  The planet we live on.
",398474,Fry," I'd hate to be those guys.
",288475,Hermes," What's got into him? He's twitching like Zoidberg when someone mentions the word ""food"".
",908476,Zoidberg,"  What, now?
",138477,Leela,"  No! Nibbler, come back!
",268478,Leela," Too bad Nibbler's not around. I guess I'll have to eat this raw, dripping ham by myself.  Nibbler?  Nibbler, you're scaring me.  Nibbler?  Am I going crazy? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me?   Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here.  Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little bit?
",3168479,Fry," Leela back yet?
",178480,Bender," Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!
",418481,Fry," You don't have a heart; you're a robot.
",418482,Bender," Sure ... right. Robot!  Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky.
",648483,Fry," Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal.
",398484,Bender," Am I a robot?
",158485,Fry," Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney.
",948486,Bender," Fry!  My skin!
",168487,Farnsworth," Ow. Ow. Ow.  I'm a genius. Ow. Ow.
",368488,Fry," Dr. Zoidberg, why is everyone acting so weird?
",488489,Zoidberg," Zoidy want balloon! Want balloon now!  Zoidy want go outside!
",638490,Fry,"  I just let you back in!
",268491,Leela," This is unbelievable. I thought you were a furry little moron. But here you are flying an adorable spaceship. If only you could talk.  Wait! I understood that!  You say you're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain.  You say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid?  Oh, stupider. And you go on to say that we're headed for your home planet where your race has lived since the beginning of the universe?  So, how did the universe begin?  Then the meaning of existence--  So every religion is wrong!
",5318492,Linda,"  You fell!  Hi! Today some bad things happened. One bad thing was a train got crashed in New Jersey. Wanna see?  People won't be late for work though, because the governor lady said,  ""I'm sending in more trains!""
",2158493,Woman #1,"  Go!
",68494,Man #1,"  Wait for me! Wait for me!
",288495,Morbo,"  Morbo can't understand his TelePrompTer. He forgot how you say that letter that looks like a man with a hat.
",1118496,Linda,"  It's a ""T"". It goes ""tuh"".
",298497,Morbo,"  Hello, little man. I will destroy you!
",418498,Fry," Man, even the news monster is acting strange. What are we gonna do?
",698499,Farnsworth," Duh, I know! Let's play the lottery!
",388500,Amy," No. Let's buy Internet stock!
",318501,Zoidberg," On margin! Zoidy wanna buy on margin!
",398502,Hermes," Look at me! I'm invisible!
",288503,Fry," Wait a minute! I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots!
",718504,Bender," Hey, let's all join the Reform Party!
",398505,Hermes," Oh, yeah!
",118506,Ken," Welcome back, Lord Nibbler, Ambassador to Earth, homeworld of the pizza bagel.
",808507,Nibbler," Thank you. I bear many receipts for reimbursement.
",528508,Fiona," The four welcomes of friendship to you as well, Leela. We shall manipulate your mind so we appear to be speaking your language. Do not be afraid, my child.
",1578509,Leela," I'm not afraid.
",178510,Fiona," Uh, good. Good.
",178511,Leela," So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? That's a coincidence.
",598512,Nibbler," That name is for your sake. In the time it would take to pronounce one letter of my true name, a trillion cosmoses would flair into existence and sink into eternal night.
",1728513,Leela," Oh, you're all so cute!
",258514,Ken," No, we're not.  We Nibblonians are an ancient and powerful race. Behold.  When the universe was forged in the crucible of the Big Bang, our mighty race was already 17 years old.
",1798515,Leela," Aww!
",68516,Ken," For the first millisecond of time, things were OK. But then there arose a terrible enemy: The Brain Spawn.  Ever since, we have waged unceasing war against these dreadful--
",1748517,Nibblonian Chef," Lunch is ready.
",178518,Ken," Then let the feast of a thousand hams begin.
",468519,Leela," So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth, Nibbler?
",568520,Nibbler," The Brain Spawn hate all consciousness. The thoughts of others screech at them like the forced laughs of a billion art house movie patrons.
",1418521,Ken," Thus, they travel from world to world making everyone stupid in order to wipe out all thought in the universe.
",1128522,Leela," Wipe out all thought? My God! They're like flying televisions.
",648523,Fiona," And even we are powerless to stop them, fearsome though we are.
",658524,Nibbler," There is but one being who can resist them. A child of destiny whose bizarre brain wave pattern makes him immune to the Brain Spawn attack.  He is the hope of the universe.  The fate of your world, perhaps all worlds, rests in his special mind.
",2468525,Leela," Now, when you say ""special""...
",328526,Fry," Attention, New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!
",528527,Ken,"  Nibblonian fleet holding at perimeter of moron zone, formerly known as ""Earth"".
",828528,Leela," Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains? Because he doesn't shower?
",748529,Fiona," The Brain Spawn suppress intelligence by attacking the delta brain wave. Every animal and robot in the universe generates this wave, as do certain trees.
",1558530,Nibbler," Fry, however, does not.
",258531,Fiona," Somehow he has cobbled together a random assortment of other brain waves into a working mind.
",958532,Leela," Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants.
",468533,Nibbler," Yes, like your prom dress.
",288534,Ken," The Brain Spawn are commanded by a giant, evil brain with a gooey centre of pure hate.
",888535,Fiona," Only Fry, with his superior, yet inferior mind, can approach him. You must tell him to disable it. We will do the rest.
",1218536,Leela," You can count on me.
",228537,Fiona," No, we can't. Once on Earth, you will be too stupid to remember the message.
",788538,Nibbler," That's why we wrote it down for you.
",388539,Ken," We've also prepared a bag lunch and some mittens.
",518540,Fry," Time to re-educate you dunce-bags. We'll start with US presidents.  This was our first president, George Washington.  Let's review. Who was our first president?
",1628541,Amy," Um.
",58542,Bender," A pickle jar?
",158543,Washington," Thomas Jefferson?
",198544,Fry," Leela! I've been so worried. Are you a bonehead?
",508545,Leela," I ... have to tell ... must ... important ... something--
",598546,Fry," Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You're going a mile a minute.
",548547,Leela," This! You for this!
",218548,Fry," Thanks!
",98549,Leela," No!  Ow! Fire hot.
",208550,Farnsworth," The professy will help!  Fire indeed hot!
",438551,Arthur," Oh! Chester A. Arthur fall down.
",348552,Leela," Brain. Brain make people dumb.
",328553,Fry," No, Leela. Brain make people smart.
",378554,Leela," You go fight biggest brain of all.
",368555,Fry," Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?
",498556,Leela,"  I 'unno!
",118557,Fry," Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be?  The libary!
",928558,Big Brain," Pathetic human race. Arranging their knowledge by category just made it easier to absorb. Dewey, you fool, your decimal system has played right into my hands!  What do you want?
",1798559,Fry," I'm here to kick your ass.
",288560,Big Brain," Wishful thinking. We have long since evolved beyond the need for asses.  Odd. My stupefaction field is having no effect on your ability to think.
",1478561,Fry," That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing!  OK, better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think!  Thinking ... thinking...
",1658562,Big Brain," Oh! Stop that!
",168563,Fry," Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that.  Aha! Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic.
",1228564,Leela," Duh...
",88565,Fry," Seriously, I can't think of anything.  Gotta find something to make me think. Hardy Boys, too easy. Nancy Drew, too hard. Aha! Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!
",1628566,Big Brain," No! It's unbearable!
",228567,Fiona," The brains are weakening.  Nibblonians to Nibble stations. Prepare cuddle bug for deployment in 40 nibblets.
",1108568,Nibbler," Sometimes I fear we are cute.
",318569,Fiona," Oh, niggle-snoosh!
",208570,Fry," Take that! And that! This sentence I don't understand but take this one!
",748571,Big Brain," You have not won yet.  Each book in this room is a gateway to a mental realm and I shall take you there and imprison you forever.
",1318572,Leela," Icky!
",78573,Fry," Where are we?
",158574,Ahab," A gold doubloon to the man who first spies the white whale.
",618575,Queequeg,"  Big whale over there.
",248576,Ahab," Arr! I saw it first!
",228577,Queequeg," Wait! That no white whale. It grey, think-y whale!
",528578,Fry," Queequeg, let go of me! I have to kill it!
",448579,Big Brain," Farewell! You will all be trapped in this dense, symbolist tome forever!
",748580,Fry," Follow him! It's our only way out!
",368581,Fry," Excuse me, have you seen a giant brain?
",418582,Tom Sawyer," Yep. I let him help me whitewash Aunt Polly's fence.
",548583,Big Brain," Tom Sawyer, you tricked me. This is less fun than previously indicated. Let this corny slice of Americana be your tomb for all eternity.
",1388584,Tom Sawyer," Please, no!
",138585,Fry,"  Come on!
",118586,Woman #1," Mr. Fry, Mama tells us you're quite the oddity; a bachelor at your age.
",738587,Fry," You think I'm an oddity? Wait'll you see--
",448588,Butler," Presenting the most eligible landowner in all Hertfordshire, Mr. Brainly.
",758589,Big Brain," I'm a gigantic brain!
",238590,Man #1," I say!
",88591,Man #1 #2," Most un-gentleman-like!
",258592,Woman #1," Mr. Brainly, what news have you of the London season?
",558593,Big Brain," Well--
",88594,Fry," Hey, Brain-y! Think fast!
",278595,Big Brain," I always think fast.
",228596,Ahab," The whale! He be white now!
",298597,Fry," Leela, I've got an idea. Stay here with Queequeg.
",518598,Leela," Is there Mrs. Queequeg?
",258599,Fry," Yes! I'm free!  Alright, Brain. Get ready for some electroshock treatment!
",768600,Leela," Fry, don't die! Wake up!   Nooo!
",348601,Fry,"  Leela cried for her lost love as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase. The Big Brain laughed in triumph...  Then, for no reason, he left Earth forever. The end.  There!  Now he's trapped in a book I wrote; a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors.
",2598602,Big Brain," The Big Brain am winning again. I am the greetest!  Now I am leaving Earth for no raeson!
",918603,Nibbler," The Big Brain is defeated. Let what must be done be done.
",598604,Leela," Me ... feel ... a bit better in cognitive faculties.
",548605,Fry,"  I did it!  And it's all thanks to the books at my local library.
",678606,Nibbler,"  And so life returned to normal, or as normal as it gets on this primitive dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes.
",1148607,Nibbler,"  Thanks to the effect of the brain rays, the people of Earth had no memory of what had transpired, except Fry, and no one believed him or cared what he had to say.
",1658608,Nibbler,"  I, meanwhile, returned to my post, ever vigilant, lest Earth again come under Brain attack. And when that day comes, God help us. God help us all.
",1498609,Leela," Time for a diap-y change!
",278610,Nibbler,"  End transmission.
",208611,Humorbot 5.0," So I says, ""Super collider? I just met her!""  And then they built the super collider. Thank you, you've been a great audience.
",1288612,Florp," Humorbot 5.0, ladies and gentlemen. Our next stand-up's a veteran of four comedy traffic schools. Give it way up for Bobcat Zoidberg!
",1358613,Fry,"  Alright!
",118614,Leela,"  Yeah!
",88615,Bender,"  Alright, Zoidberg!
",218616,Zoidberg," Earth: What a planet. On Earth, you enjoy eating a tasty clam. On my planet, clams enjoy eating a tasty you.  Maybe I'm not yelling loud enough.  On Earth, everybody is always looking for a giant squid. On my planet--
",2198617,Bender," Reload.
",98618,Zoidberg," So these three parasitic worms bore into a human's head--
",598619,Woman #1 #1," Ew, gross.
",128620,Zoidberg," And they walk up to the bar and then-- Uh-oh.  Wait, stop! I've got more!
",758621,Zoidberg," My whole life I worked on that act. And they hated it.
",568622,Hermes," You're a crazy, penniless, lobster doctor. No combination of you should be a comedian.
",888623,Zoidberg," But comedy is in my valves. My Uncle Harold was a big Hollywood star back in the era of silent holograms.
",1078624,Leela," Your uncle was Harold Zoid?
",298625,Zoidberg," This I cannot deny.
",218626,Farnsworth," Why, I've been a Harold Zoid fan since back when my hips were made of bone. As it happens, I still have some of my original 78s.
",1308627,Hermes," You're right, crabby. He's a hell of a lot funnier than you could ever be.
",768628,Zoidberg," Maybe so, but perhaps if I wrote him and asked for a few hundred pointers...
",788629,Zoidberg," This letter has to be very personal, so I'm writing it in my own ink.   Dear Uncle Zoid, greetings from your long-lost nephew. Norm and Sam and Sadie's boy, remember?
",1688630,Zoidberg,"  Now I am the most important doctor at the delivery company where I work. But, sadly, my life is bereft of laughter.
",1188631,Zoid,"  I beg of you, Mr. Funny Uncle, teach me the comedy business. Sincerely, Zoidberg.  Oy, isn't that nice? He took the time.
",1248632,Woman #1 #2," What's that scribbledy-gook?
",308633,Zoid," This is a fan letter from my rich doctor nephew, who just might be my ticket out of this flophouse, he might.  Yeah, you'd better run.  Dear Rich Doctor Nephew, I can help you be funny. The first funny thing you must do is put all your money in the form of a cashier's check and come to Hollywood.
",2998634,Zoidberg,"  Sincerely, Harold Zoid. P.S. Cashier's check.  Did you hear that? I'm going to Hollywood!
",928635,Tour Guide," Welcome to Hollywood! I must warn you, there's no refund if you get discovered and leave the tour!  I'm just kidding, that never happens. Now, to your right, you'll see 30th Century Fox Studios.  Fox uses those searchlights to blind pilots, then film the resulting plane crashes.
",2818636,Bender," Neat!
",78637,Tour Guide," Ahead, you'll see the home of Mel Gibson, star of the hit film, Bravehead.  And do we have any fans of Calculon, star of the robot soap opera All My Circuits?
",1608638,Bender," Oh! I am! Me!  Bender is!
",278639,Tour Guide," Then you'll wanna get a close look at his luxurious Bel-Air home.
",678640,Bender," Yes, I will.
",148641,Calculon," Are you my new hot water heater?
",348642,Bender," No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?
",408643,Calculon," Absolutely not.
",178644,Bender," Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause it was a lot, you remember, right?
",1108645,Calculon," Look, I'm programmed to be very busy. Unless you can heat water to 212 degrees, I'm not interested.  Have you got an extra GOTO 10 line? I said I don't need a bender.
",1688646,Bender," Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.
",518647,Calculon," Nice work, Boiler.
",208648,Bender," Thanks. And call me Bender.
",298649,Zoidberg," That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid for lunch to discuss my Hollywood dreams. Next time you see me, don't be surprised if I've eaten.
",1358650,Zoidberg," Uncle Zoid, you're looking young enough to be thrown back!
",608651,Zoid," Rich nephew, come over here and give your uncle a nice, big meal.  So, here we are: A still-famous film comedian.
",1158652,Zoidberg," And a rich, respected doctor with many surviving patients.
",608653,Zoid," Eating real food in a restaurant, as we both often do. So, you want to be a comedian, is it?
",948654,Zoidberg," It's my lifelong dream.
",258655,Zoid,"  Well that dream dies now.  You're unfunny and untalented. That's why you're perfect for drama.
",978656,Zoidberg," Hmm. Serious drama. Perhaps it is time to give up comedy.
",598657,Zoid," I'm putting together a big drama picture right now, as we speak. The script is dynamite. I know because I wrote it myself. And with me directing and starring, I'll be back on top after 50 miserable years--  Uh, of fame.
",2218658,Zoidberg," Ah, fame. Where do I come in?
",318659,Zoid," This fame film has a juicy part for you, if you completely finance it with your doctor money. So, are you in?
",1118660,Zoidberg," Uh, OK. How much do I have to invest?
",398661,Zoid," Oh, not much, not much,  A million dollars.   Then it's settled. Another blockbuster Hollywood deal.
",1028662,Waiter," What can I get you gentlemen?
",318663,Zoidberg," Is bread free?
",168664,Waiter," Yeah.
",78665,Zoidberg," We'll split an order.
",238666,Bender," What's with Monstro?
",228667,Fry," He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.
",718668,Zoidberg,"  I've only been here a day and already I'm a Hollywood phoney.
",648669,Bender,"  Well, perhaps I could call on TV's Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz.
",808670,Fry," Since when have you been in the biz?
",388671,Bender," Long enough, little man. Long enough.
",398672,Bender," Calculon, as your hot water heater ...  ... I would be remiss if I didn't bring you scripts that could make you an international film star.
",1418673,Calculon," Of course. Tell me about the project.
",398674,Zoidberg," It's a movie.
",158675,Calculon," Interesting. Tell me more.
",288676,Bender," Get this: For a scant $1 million investment, you can be the star.
",678677,Calculon," And?
",68678,Bender," And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar.
",468679,Calculon," An Oscar, you say? That would get me out of this festering rat's nest called ""television"" once and for all. Let me see the script.  No. No, I don't like the font.  Wait! Harold Zoid? Was this written by the Harold Zoid?
",2218680,Zoidberg," Written and Xeroxed.
",228681,Calculon," Good heavens! A chance to work with the legendary Harold Zoid. He's one of my great idols. And-And you say you can guarantee me the Oscar?
",1408682,Bender," I can guarantee anything you want.
",368683,Calculon," Then I'll do it!
",188684,Zoidberg," Hooray!
",98685,Bender," Here's your chequebook.
",258686,Calculon," Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our director, the legendary Harold Zoid!
",758687,Zoid," Thank you. A more classic movie plot there isn't: A son who does not want to follow in his father's business. And that business is being President of Earth, no less. The son, as it happens, is Vice President.
",2108688,Bender,"  That plot makes perfect sense. Wink, wink.
",458689,Zoidberg," Bender, you said ""wink, wink"" out loud.
",418690,Bender," No, I didn't. Raise middle finger.
",368691,Zoid," Now remember, and I can't stress this enough, this is a talkie, so I want the full gamut of emotions from every actor in every scene.
",1358692,Zoidberg," The Magnificent Three. Scene one, take one.
",458693,Zoid," And, action!
",148694,Calculon," Take back your gilded pen, Father. Signing bills into law was always your dream, not mine.
",928695,Zoid," Cut! Cut! Cut it!  I said this is a talkie, damnit! You've got to emote more! And you extras, wave your arms and make faces. What is this, a morgue?
",1508696,Zoidberg," The Magnificent Three. Scene 10, take 95.
",438697,Zoid," Action. And I mean circus-grade action.
",418698,Calculon,"  Sir, I call upon you not as a President but as a father.
",598699,Zoid," Cut, cut, cut it!  Would you show a little emotion?  People, people, please. Just because it's a dramatic scene, doesn't mean you can't do a little comedy in the background.  Throw a pie or two, for God's sake.
",2128700,Calculon,"  Nooo!
",88701,Zoid," Cut, cut it! Eck! Look, look, it's alright, kid. We'll, uh, we'll get it in editing. Alright, that's a wrap, everybody. I'm gonna see you all at the premiere which, by the way, when is?
",1878702,Zoidberg," Well, editing is a long and expensive process but we spent all the money on pies, so it'll be ready Friday.
",1098703,Bender," Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel.
",668704,Calculon," I just pray they like me half as much as I do.
",488705,Calculon,"  I agreed to be your Vice President but I never agreed to be your son.  Thank you, Lieutenant Smith.
",1028706,Zoidberg,"  Good morning, Mr. Vice President!
",368707,Fry," Leela, we're missing the premiere.  My only goal in life was to attend a Hollywood shindig. Just pay the valet the two bucks.
",1278708,Leela," No! It's the principle of the thing. Besides, I think I see a parking lot up ahead.
",858709,Calculon,"  Father, I've asked you to join me on the White House roof so we could have a heart-to-heart talk. I will never follow in your footsteps. Here is my resignation as Vice President.
",1818710,Zoid,"  No! My son will not shame me like this. I would sooner die, I would!
",718711,Calculon,"  Father! The ledge!
",218712,Zoid,"  Oy!
",68713,Calculon,"  Oh!
",68714,Zoidberg,"  The President is dead. Congratulations, Mr. President!
",578715,Calculon,"  Nooo!
",88716,Bender,"  Woo-hoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!
",358717,Calculon," Everyone walked out. They hated it. I've seen plagues that had better opening nights than this. You said that Oscar was practically on my mantel.
",1478718,Bender," Now you know why I use the qualifier, ""practically"".
",548719,Calculon," You listen to me. I'm out a million bucks here! You get me that Oscar or you're dead! You and these snivelling lobsters! Dead. You hear me? Dead!
",1478720,Zoid," Oy, now he emotes!
",208721,Zoidberg," Let's just hope Calculon breaks our legs; they'll grow back.
",628722,Zoid," He's gonna kill us, you klutzel! Who told that under-acting stiff he was going to get an Oscar?
",978723,Bender," Me. It seemed like the least honest way to get him to pay for the movie.
",748724,Zoid," He paid?  I though you paid, with your big-shot doctor money.
",638725,Zoidberg,"  I lied.
",108726,Zoid," OK, enough with the blubbering, already. The way I directed the hell out of him, he may still very well get the nomination.
",1258727,Bender," Wink.
",78728,Calculon," 400 categories and not a single nomination for me.
",528729,Zoidberg," But you won this Golden Globe!
",328730,Calculon," Piffle! That's the Emmy of movie awards!  I told you I want an Oscar.
",718731,Bender," Then maybe you should act better.
",358732,Calculon," The Oscar isn't about acting. It's about earning the respect and admiration of the creative community.
",1048733,Zoid," How 'bout we rig the awards?
",308734,Calculon," That's fine too.
",188735,Leela," It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it.
",648736,Fry," Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy the sights.  Oh, my God! Sylvester Stallone!
",1198737,Zoidberg," This is where you live? I though you were a big-shot Hollywood movie star.
",768738,Zoid," No, I'm not. I'm an even bigger liar than you. My career went down the tubes the day they invented smell-a-vision.
",1168739,Bender," Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.
",698740,Zoid," Oy. All I wanted was for people to think of me one last time before I die.
",768741,Zoidberg," What are you talking about, Uncle? Everybody remembers Harold Zoid!
",698742,Zoid," As a pathetic has-been, they remember me. As a forgotten relic, they remember me. Bah! It's better to die now.
",1128743,Zoidberg," No. This is one death Dr. Zoidberg won't be responsible for. Zoidberg away!
",778744,Rivers," Hi, I'm Joan Rivers' head. I tell you, I've had so many face-lifts, they finally lifted it right off my body! It's true, it's true! Oh, oh, oh! Here comes Jack Nicholson's DNA reconstituted in a gorilla body.
",2108745,Bender," Catering.
",118746,Rivers," Oh, and here's washed-up actor, whatshisname, Harold Zoid. Are you presenting one of those tacky honorary awards, or just getting one?
",1368747,Zoid," I'm a seat-filler, Joan's head. My only marketable skill is to occupy space.
",788748,Calculon," You know, the second I don't win that award, you're cat food. Right, Boxy?
",768749,Announcer #1," And now, the host of the 1074th Academy Awards, Billy Crystal.
",648750,Crystal," Now I know how a Pez dispenser feels.  Oh, you like that one, Jack?  Alright, we're already one hour behind.  Our first award tonight: Best Cinematography in a Non-Visible Spectrum.
",1838751,Fry," It's been two weeks. You wanna play tic-tac-toe again before we eat our shoes?
",808752,Leela," Oh, I always knew I'd die at the bottom of a pit. But a pit full of tar?
",748753,Fry," What was that? A tar dolphin or a tar shark?
",468754,Leela," It's some kind of hollow tube, devoid of human life.  The Los Angeles subway! We can blast our way in and escape!
",1158755,Fry," Alright, but I still feel like having a shoe.
",478756,Zoidberg," What category are they on?
",288757,Bender," They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to writing.
",798758,Zoidberg," That just leaves Best Soft-Drink Product Placement and then Best Actor. We don't have much time.
",988759,Crystal," And the nominees for Best Soft-Drink Product Placement are:
",618760,Slurm Machine," Star Trek: The Pepsi Generation, They Call Me Mr. Pibb and Snow White and the 7 Ups.
",868761,Bender," And now to present the award for Best Actor ...  ... a bit player in the flop movie The Magnificent Three ...  ... Dr. Zoidberg.
",1308762,Calculon,"  OK, Boxy, keep your prong on the trigger.
",448763,Zoidberg," And the nominees for Best Actor are: Sir Lawrence--  ... in The Merchant of Venus, Hive Mind Gamma 7X in Bikini Party Summer, the Soda Machine Robot in Bikini Party Summer, Mark Jones in How Beige Was My Jacket and, instead of the fifth guy, Calculon, for his powerhouse performance in The Magnificent Three.
",3108764,Man #1," Uh-oh, he read the wrong name.
",328765,Man #1 #2,"  Shh, just play along, like they did for Marisa Tomei.
",568766,Zoid," Hooray, I won't be murdered. I'll live another day. Another day of ... pathetic, forgotten misery.
",1008767,Zoidberg," And the winner is...  And the winner, instead of any of the nominees, is the legendary Harold Zoid!
",1018768,Zoid," Thank you. Thank you so much! You know, through all my ups and downs, I always thought the most important thing in life was to win an Oscar. But tonight I realise what's really important is to win two Oscars. Ha! Ha! I'm kidding, I'm kidding. What really matters in life is that people care about you, whether it's a whole crowd ...  ... or just one die-hard fan.
",3658769,Zoid," Thank you, nephew.  Now I can die happy. 10 seconds from now, when Calculon kills us.
",878770,Calculon," Harold Zoid!
",148771,Bender," Hit the deck!
",158772,Calculon," Where's that Oscar?
",218773,Zoid," Here, enjoy. What are you getting upset? It's slightly less fraudulent for you to have it.
",928774,Calculon," Yes. Yes, it's a real beauty. Someday I hope to win one of my own.
",688775,Bender," Then you're not going to kill us, Your Majesty?
",498776,Calculon," Nay. I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.
",898777,Zoidberg," Earthquake!
",138778,Bender," Hit the deck!
",158779,Zoid," Let the earth quake, I've got somebody's Oscar!
",498780,Fry," We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!
",398781,Doorman," I'm sorry, sir, this is a private-- Oh, pardon me, I see you're with Mr. Stallone.
",848782,Morbo," So I gave the cookies you made to Fawn and the kids and they couldn't believe it -- they were delicious. But, I digress.   Tremble, puny earthlings! One day my race will destroy you all!
",1888783,Leela," Could one of you guys get that?
",338784,Leela," It's a doorbell baby!  Hello, little guy. You know, I was abandoned as a baby too, so--
",898785,Bender," Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it.
",378786,Leela," Bender, stop! It's a baby!
",288787,Bender,"  A baby what?  Ow!
",208788,Leela," Oh, it's just a card. From the orphanarium I grew up in.
",588789,Card," Leela, you're invited to a reunion at Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium.  Please stand clear of self-destructing basket.
",1298790,Bender," A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? You gonna go?
",548791,Leela," No way, Jose-bot. I never wanna see those other orphans again! Not after the way they used to pick on me.
",1078792,Kids,"  One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
",298793,Kirk," Nice depth-perception, one-eye!
",338794,Leela," How can you make fun of me, Kirk? You're blind!
",498795,Kirk," My eyes may not work, but at least I got two of them!
",558796,Fry," Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine the look on their faces when you show up with two friends who eat all the hors d'Oeuvres.
",1328797,Leela," Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success in a few choice faces.
",658798,Bender," Set a course for adventure!
",298799,Fry," Ew!
",58800,Bender," What a dump!
",148801,Leela," Just like old times. Gosh! The bars on the windows seemed so much thicker back then.  Mr. Vogel? Remember me?
",1118802,Vogel," Leela! You're worthless and no one will ever love you!
",568803,Leela," You used to say that all the time!
",368804,Vogel," Oh, those were happier days.
",308805,Fry," Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't half bad.
",478806,Bender," And try one of these Popsicle sticks. They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour.
",808807,Leela," Hey, look. It's our old group picture.
",408808,Fry," I don't see you anywhere.
",278809,Leela," That's me over in Cootietown.
",318810,Bender," Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking guy!
",478811,Leela," That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have kind of a crush on him.
",618812,Kids,"  One-eye! One-eye!
",208813,French Guy," Stupid as a French guy!
",258814,Kids,"  One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
",748815,Leela," Well, it's time to say hello to the old gang.
",478816,Man #1," So, whatcha been up to since you left the orphanarium?
",568817,Man #1 #2," Uh, living in a box, fighting the shakes. You?
",488818,Man #1," Selling kidneys, teeth, whatever falls out of me.
",518819,Leela," And what am I up to, you ask? Why, I'm a very successful space captain.
",738820,Man #1 #2," Oh.
",58821,Man #1," Wow.
",68822,Man #1 #3," How nice for you, Leela.
",268823,Woman #1," That's so good for a person with one eye.
",438824,Leela," Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm a space captain and you're a bunch of losers.
",858825,Man #1," Uh, right, right. We're the losers!
",378826,Kirk," Well, if it isn't old one-eye!
",328827,Leela," Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!
",368828,Man #1 #3," He can't hear you. He's deaf now.
",358829,Adlai," Leave Leela alone. She's leading a perfectly normal life. She's not gussied up, duded out, getting down or where it's at. Now run along.
",1388830,Leela," Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really outgrow being an eyeball-- Oddball!
",778831,Adlai," Nonsense. You're a space captain. That's a fine, conventional profession.
",758832,Leela," Well, you know, it's just for a package delivery service.
",598833,Adlai," Ah-ah. A package is just a box until it's delivered.
",548834,Leela," Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. So what do you do these days?
",708835,Adlai," Oh, I'm a doctor.
",198836,Leela," A tall doctor, you say?
",258837,Vogel," Sir, you seem pretty stable. Have you thought about adopting one of our kids?
",798838,Fry," Sure haven't.
",158839,Vogel," Well keep adoption in mind. It's a great way to have a kid without having sex.
",808840,Fry,"  Really?
",108841,Vogel," Plus, the government will help out with a small stipend of $100 a week.
",738842,Bender," $100 a week?
",148843,Adlai," I'm so sorry I teased you back then. Let me make it up to you. I can fix it so no one ever makes fun of you again.
",1168844,Leela," You mean by beating them up? Because I've broken that blind kid's nose like 10 times and it doesn't make any difference.
",1228845,Adlai," No, I specialise in phaser eye surgery. I can build you a paraffin eye and graft it on with skin from your foot. It won't be able to see but you'll look like a perfectly normal two-eyed person.
",1958846,Leela," Me? Perfectly normal?
",238847,Bender," Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry.
",348848,Fry," Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your ass?
",778849,Bender," No. It's called ""parenting"". Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends to collect.
",958850,Boy," Our daddy's a giant toy!
",268851,Farnsworth," Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping at her eye all the time.
",1048852,Amy," I think cosmetic surgery's great, Leela. I used to be too cute, so I had cuteness-reduction surgery here ...  ... and here.
",1258853,Fry," You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need surgery. You look great the way you are.
",818854,Leela," Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once in my life, I just wanna look normal.
",788855,Fry," But you're better than normal, you're abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't care what other people think.
",1088856,Leela," You're right! I'll start by not caring what you think!  I'm getting the surgery.
",828857,Farnsworth," That a girl!
",148858,Amy," Right on!
",118859,Zoidberg," Wonderful. And while you're under the knife, you could also get an ink pouch to help you escape your enemies.
",1118860,Farnsworth," That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard, you imbecile!
",588861,Adlai," Now we'll find out if the operation was a success. Hold on to your hats.  Oh, I'm sorry, this is the wrong patient.  Oops.
",1248862,Amy," Leela, those eyes look so great on you.
",418863,Fry," Bah! I think she looked fine before.
",388864,Farnsworth," No.
",58865,Zoidberg," No.
",58866,Amy," Uh-uh.
",88867,Hermes," Wrong.
",88868,Leela," Wow, look at me. Although I don't have the hang of blinking yet.
",668869,Adlai," You'll get it. Personally, I try not to blink too much because it seems flashy. But when I do, I enjoy it.
",1088870,Leela," I did it! I blunk!
",208871,Hermes," And just in time to screw up this picture I took!
",518872,Leela," Hooray!
",98873,Walt," Ow!
",58874,Igner," Ow!
",58875,Larry," Ow!
",58876,Leela," I've never felt so unremarkable! Today I actually blended in with a crowd!
",768877,Bender," Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with.
",388878,Kids,"  Hello, jerkbags!
",198879,Amy," Oh, they're so cute! What are their names?
",448880,Bender," Kids have names?
",188881,Nina," My name's Nina, and his name's Albert--
",418882,Bender," And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.!  Lookie here! My first government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!
",1308883,Sally," Daddy Bender, we're hungry.
",298884,Bender," What is it with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food!  Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food.
",1088885,Albert," Can we have Bender burgers again?
",358886,Bender," No. The cat shelter's on to me!
",338887,Adlai," Hello, Leela. I was in a nearby tailor getting one of my Hawai'ian shirts toned down, so I thought I'd drop in for your follow-up exam.
",1378888,Leela," Oh. That's so handsome of you.
",328889,Adlai," Just follow the light with your eyes.  Perfect! You know, a guy could fall head-over-heels for a gal like you.  As for me, I'm somewhat interested myself.
",1568890,Leela," What are you saying?
",228891,Adlai," I've never been good with words, which is why I'm in such a delicate conundrum. Will you go out with me this Sunday?
",1188892,Leela," Sure!
",78893,Adlai," I don't know what else to say, so I'll just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then.
",798894,Fry," This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's only interested now that you have two eyes.
",1178895,Leela," You're just jealous!
",228896,Fry," No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!
",588897,Leela," Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with him no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life.
",1398898,Zoidberg," Be careful with that Adlai, Leela, he's a doctor, they're very poor.
",708899,Leela," Actually, most doctors are rich.
",348900,Zoidberg," What? When did this happen? You're joking, right?  That's not funny!
",708901,Bender," OK, they've got everything you need here: Booze, a couple of peanuts, they got a crapper in the back. That's one of the things you kids do, right?
",1488902,Albert," Yeah.
",78903,Bender," Then knock yourself out.  Hey! Hey! Only eat and drink enough to barely keep yourselves alive! I'm trying to make a profit here.
",1308904,Nina," Daddy! Bethany's hitting me!
",308905,Bender," Here.
",78906,Fembot #1," These kids yours?
",198907,Bender," Yeah.
",78908,Fembot #1," Ooh. I'm attracted to a man with responsibility!
",508909,Bender," That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some fun.
",868910,Boy," Daddy Bender?
",158911,Bender," Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!
",1038912,Boy," I love you, Daddy Bender!
",278913,Bender," Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!
",528914,Fembot #1," I guess you're busy. I'll catch you later.
",448915,Bender," You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull but I got half a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it!   Oh, come on!
",1488916,Adlai," I thought I'd take you someplace ordinary, a place no one could object to.
",768917,Leela," That sounds wonderful.
",248918,Man #1 #4," I'd like an extra-beautiful bouquet for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart.
",718919,Adlai," Average, please.
",188920,Leela," Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or avoided staring at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird.
",1448921,Adlai," Leela, you're 999,999 in a million!
",378922,Leela," Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?
",698923,Zoidberg,"  Totally.
",118924,Adlai," Uh, listen. I just want you all to know your Leela's one standard lady.
",738925,Leela," Oh, Adlai, stop!
",188926,Fry," What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren't normal and that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg: He's a weird monster who smells like he eats garbage and does.
",1908927,Zoidberg," Damn right!
",138928,Fry," And the Professor's a senile, amoral crackpot.  Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.
",858929,Hermes," Tally me banana.
",188930,Fry," Amy's a klutz from Mars.
",268931,Amy," Sploops!
",108932,Farnsworth," And, Fry, you've got that brain thing.
",408933,Fry," I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?
",1358934,Leela," That's the dumbest question I ever heard!
",438935,Farnsworth," She's right!
",148936,Zoidberg," No doubt about it.
",208937,Amy," Duh!
",68938,Hermes," Daylight come!
",168939,Bender," Coming through, watch your heads!
",358940,Zoidberg," Help! I'm under attack!
",258941,Bender," Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right.
",808942,Elzar," Which one of you cutie muffins gets the children's spicy squab?
",658943,Sam," Me!
",58944,Bender," Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?
",608945,Sam," 'Bout time!
",138946,Bender," That's my boy!
",168947,Elzar," And here's your check. Bam!
",298948,Albert," I gotta go poopy!
",198949,Bender," Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!
",1118950,Elzar,"  You little crooks! If I catch you I'm going to make cutie-muffin gumbo!
",748951,Adlai," You know, seeing that strange robot force 12 children to do his bidding makes me think about kids of our own.
",1118952,Leela," Us? Me? You? Kids?
",208953,Adlai," That's correct. It's time to stop living this vida bachelor loca, settle down and have kids.
",948954,Leela," Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!
",588955,Albert," Daddy Bender, I want a piggy back ride.
",418956,Bender," Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog-pile on Fry.
",578957,Sally," Tell us a story, Daddy Bender.
",328958,Kids,"  Story! Story! Story!
",238959,Bender," Alright, fine, gather round.
",308960,Nina," We wanna hear this one again!
",318961,Bender,"  ""Bender's Arrest Record"" by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was caught shoplifting.
",948962,Albert," Yeah, show us the picture!  There he is!
",428963,Bender," OK, kids. It's 9.00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking at you so go to bed.  The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma.
",1358964,Bender," Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps!  Oh! I need a calculator.
",928965,Fry," You are a calculator.
",238966,Bender," I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper--  I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing me 110!
",1298967,Fry," There goes my new kitchen cabinets.
",378968,Bender," I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!
",728969,Sam," Daddy, how do I flush you?
",288970,Bender,"  Just go to bed!
",188971,Adlai," You know, doing this jigsaw puzzle of a pacifier factory makes me want to have children with you all the more.
",1128972,Leela," Adlai, I was thinking, since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt a child.
",818973,Adlai," Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable. Heck, it's more than acceptable, it's adequately satisfactory!
",988974,Bender," Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale. Let me check.  Oh, aren't you a cutie?  About 35lbs.  What?
",1408975,Leela," Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child.
",418976,Bender," Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans today?
",1778977,Adlai," Uh, I'm afraid we only want one.
",348978,Bender," Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock.
",618979,Leela," I remember this from when we were kids: The warden would trot you out in front of prospective parents and they'd judge you like a piece of meat.
",1468980,Albert," I'm Albert.
",138981,Leela," Kind of fatty.
",168982,Bender," Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.
",748983,Leela," Uh, um.
",98984,Adlai," Hmm.
",68985,Bender," If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit.  Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion I understand is called ""love"".
",1608986,Sally," One time, I did a hundred jump ropes.
",398987,Leela," Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it.
",578988,Bender," OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk now, time for bed.
",518989,Albert," But it's 10 in the morning!
",298990,Bender," I said hit the hay!
",218991,Leela," Oh, they're all so adorable.
",308992,Bender," Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England.
",1358993,Smitty," You're under arrest for child cruelty, child endangerment, depriving children of food, selling children as food and misrepresenting the weight of livestock.
",1588994,Bender," If you had kids of your own, you'd understand!
",488995,Leela," Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?
",618996,Smitty," Might as well. They're just gonna rot in the evidence locker.
",638997,Orphan #1," Nice ear!
",118998,Orphan #2," Hey, freaky ears!
",198999,Orphan #3," How's you hearing?
",209000,Leela," I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.
",409001,Adlai," Her? But there's plenty of normal ones.
",419002,Leela," Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad.
",539003,Kids,"  Ear-face! Ear-face! Sally won the ugly race!
",479004,Adlai," On the other hand, the children bring up a good point. She does have an ear on her face.
",909005,Leela," Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home.
",739006,Adlai," Oh, alright. If you really want that one, I can give her an operation to make her acceptable.
",959007,Leela," She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!
",599008,Adlai," Oh, and I suppose you were fine the way you were?
",519009,Leela," Damn right I was!
",199010,Fry," Yay!
",69011,Leela," Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just wished I'd realised that when I was her age.
",1159012,Sally," I also have a tail!
",219013,Leela," Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right now!
",769014,Adlai," Why should I do that?
",239015,Leela," Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is gonna have one eye.
",729016,Vogel," In recognition of Bender's generous gift of 12 orphans and a government cheque for 1200 wing-wangs, I hereby rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez Orphanarium!
",1689017,Fry," It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back.
",539018,Leela," Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little weird.
",909019,Fry," Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything.
",459020,Albert," We'll miss you, Daddy Bender.
",319021,Nina," We know robots don't have emotions but we drawed you this picture.
",689022,Sally," So if you ever miss us, even just a teeny bit, you can look at it.
",689023,Bender," Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh!  Hey! What the-- Get away! Come on! I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey!  I hate you! I hate you all!
",1619024,Leo,"  Yes?
",79025,Amy," Hi, Dad. It's me and my co-workers.
",379026,Mrs. Wong,"  Open up, Leo. It's Amy and her weirdos.
",429027,Mrs. Wong," Howdy, friends! Welcome to Mars!
",349028,Leela," Thanks so much for inviting us, Mr. Wong. I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue.
",839029,Leo," Oh, Mars Day much better than Earth Day. Dump trash wherever you want! Big, empty planet!
",919030,Mrs. Wong," OK, then. Make yourselves at home.
",369031,Zoidberg," Don't mind if I already did. By the way, do you have anymore of this Dom Perignon bubble bath? There was only enough to fill the tub halfway.
",1439032,Farnsworth," This is quite a large ranch you have.
",399033,Leo," 17.9 billion acres. We own entire western hemisphere.  That the best hemisphere!
",829034,Farnsworth," It's the same on Earth.
",259035,Leo," Here is most number one product of all: The mighty buggalo. They used for everything; meat, milk and their shells make good row boat.
",1359036,Zoidberg,"  I broke your television.
",279037,Hermes," Mon, it must take forever to brand all those cattle.
",549038,Leo," Not really. We own so much stuff it easier just to brand everything that not ours.
",849039,Hermes," Please don't do that.
",239040,Amy," Betsy!  This is my sweet, little Betsy. I raised her from a larva that ate one of my sweaters.
",969041,Leo," Yes, everybody love Betsy. We going to eat her at Amy's wedding. If she ever get married!
",919042,Amy," Dad! Gleesh! Please don't say things like that when you meet my boyfriend tonight.
",849043,Leo," Oh, that right. We finally get to spend some time with this Mr. Kif.
",709044,Mrs. Wong," I just hope he's a nice man who can make us lot of grandchildren. This not some parallel universe where you getting any younger.
",1309045,Zapp," Now remember, Kif, the quickest way to a girl's bed is through her parents. Have sex with them and you're in.
",1119046,Kif," Actually, sir, I'm-I'm a little nervous about meeting her family.
",679047,Zapp," Well that's natural. After all you're meek and uninteresting. Until now you've gotten by on my left-over charisma, scrounging off it like a tiny charisma parasite.
",1659048,Kif," I just hope they like me.
",279049,Zapp," And why wouldn't they? Yes, yes, I know. Tiny, meek, uninteresting. Spare me your tedious life story, Kif. And above all have fun!
",1329050,Bender," Yeah, yeah, get on down!  Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!
",859051,DJ," Yo, fool, it's Mixmaster Festus!
",349052,Fry," So what's Mars Day about, anyway?
",359053,Mrs. Wong," It commemorate the day centuries ago when our ancestor, Sir Reginald Wong, bought Mars from stupid natives.
",1099054,Leela," How can you call the Native Martians ""stupid""?
",489055,Leo," They sell whole planet for one bead. Sound stupid to me!
",589056,Farnsworth," That is stupid!
",179057,Leela," I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud, bead-loving people.
",929058,Fry," Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!
",329059,Leela," Of course it is. But you don't have to laugh!
",479060,Kif," Amy, no! Not on your parents' planet!
",399061,RJ," Howdy, Amy. Glad to see you've come back to the country. It's where the flavour is.
",859062,Amy," RJ, this is my boyfriend, Kif.
",329063,RJ," This wimp? You've gone a long way, baby.  Cigarette, partner?
",639064,Kif," Oh, I don't--
",159065,RJ," I haven't even lit it yet!
",289066,Kif," Oh. Is it lit now?
",209067,RJ," Yep.  You're pathetic!
",249068,Zoidberg," Host-man! Host-woman! I'm having a wonderful time!
",529069,Leo," You here five hours and already you tear up couch, draw moustache on priceless painting and fill pool with brine shrimp.
",1229070,Zoidberg,"  Not bad for a city boy, huh?  By the way, I took the liberty of fertilising your caviar.
",919071,Amy," Just relax. I'm sure my parents will love you.
",489072,Kif," You don't understand. When I get nervous, I can't control my camouflage reflex.  Oh, dear!  Oh, goodness! Oh, odds and bodkins!
",1299073,Fry," I'll have a thorax and some feelers.
",389074,Leo," You want some salad with that?
",329075,Fry," Yuck!
",79076,Amy," Mom? Dad? You remember Kif?
",299077,Leo," This your boyfriend? I have instant dislike of him!
",539078,Mrs. Wong," He too scrawny to father grandchildren.
",419079,Amy," He's not scrawny, he's just small-boned.
",429080,Kif," Actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--
",899081,Leo," Yes, yes! You a big squishy wuss! Amy should be dating real man. Like him!
",769082,Kif," I can be manly too. I think I'll, uh, light up a smoke.
",579083,Amy,"  Wrong way!
",139084,Kif,"  Smooth!
",109085,Amy," Look on the bright side: My parents left after you passed out so they didn't even see you barf.
",979086,Kif," Oh, now they'll never think I'm manly enough to date their daughter.
",709087,Amy," It's OK, Kif.  I'll go get you a tissue from your tote.
",579088,RJ," Hey there, Amy. Like you to meet my buddy, Joe.
",499089,Joe," Sorry I'm late. My pool game ran long at the jazz club!
",579090,RJ," Kids love him!
",169091,Fry," What's that weird sound?
",269092,Leo," Dust storm! Oh, dust storm! Everybody into house. Hurry, before we die. And wipe your damn feet!
",989093,Mrs. Wong," Phew! Everyone OK? No one considering lawsuit?
",489094,Farnsworth," Hmm. I might have mental anguish.
",359095,Leo," I'll have you know I'm friends with every judge on planet.
",609096,Farnsworth," I'm OK then.
",149097,Mrs. Wong," Storm dying down. Leo, check if buggalo herd is OK.
",539098,Leo," Oh!
",59099,Leela," What happened to the buggalo?
",319100,Leo," They been rustled under cover of storm. We ruined!
",529101,Zoidberg,"  Nooo!
",89102,Amy," Don't worry, Daddy. It'll be OK.
",349103,Leo," Oh, really? Who gonna save us?  One-eye?  Lobster mooch?  Drunken garbage can?
",809104,Hermes," This sounds like a job for--
",309105,Kif," Lieutenant Kif Kroker!
",249106,Hermes," Alright then.
",159107,Leo," Aye-ah! Those buggalo are what made Wong family so rich and powerful. Oh, Inez, with them stolen, we ruined!
",1109108,Mrs. Wong," OK. I want a divorce.
",239109,Zoidberg," Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!
",359110,Amy," They're not your parents, I'm not your sister and that's not your golf cart.
",789111,Zoidberg," Aw!
",59112,Amy," Everybody just calm down. Kif promised he'd catch the rustlers.
",659113,Kif," Mrs. Wong, do you have a neckerchief I could borrow?
",549114,Kif," My plan is to take all the remaining buggalo and lead them on a rough, tough cattle drive. Then, when the rustlers attack, I'll make a citizen's arrest!
",1549115,Farnsworth," It sounds dangerous. Someone could get killed. Fry, Leela, Bender, I want you to go with him.
",959116,Fry," Aw, man!
",109117,Kif," Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Wong. I'll get your cattle back or die trying.
",749118,Leo," Hey, we can't lose!
",219119,Amy," No, Kif! It's too risky. You don't have to do this to prove your manliness.
",779120,Mrs. Wong," Oh, yes he does!
",189121,RJ," Here are your mounts!
",239122,Leela," She's got a fine coat.
",249123,Kif," Now, we need buggalo to lure the rustlers. How many are left?
",639124,Amy," You're lookin' at her. Betsy's the only one left. She was curled up in my hamper when the storm hit.  Aw, she likes you!
",1229125,Kif," Saddle up, men. We got some no good rustlers to ... catch!
",609126,Bender," Â : We've got a right to pick a little fight with rustlers,
Somebody wants to pick a fight with us,
He'd better bite my ass!
",1259127,Fry," Yee-haw!
",109128,Leela," Wow, look at that: Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system.
",759129,Fry," Where?
",89130,Leela," Right in front of you.
",249131,Fry," Oh. Oh!
",99132,Kif," We'll camp near the top. The rustlers will be sure to spot us there.
",709133,Fry," Where?
",89134,Bender," And even though the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen. It was ... the Windows logo!
",1139135,Fry," Pft, that's not scary!
",249136,Bender," It is if you're a laser printer.
",349137,Leela," OK, my turn to tell a ghost story. Once, there was this woman driving--
",739138,Fry," Hook on the hand!
",199139,Kif," OK, I've got one. This family--
",339140,Fry," Man in the attic!
",199141,Leela," Fine, Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!
",669142,Fry," With pleasure.  Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive--
",829143,Bender,"  Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer!  Sorry, go on.
",639144,Fry," And then, while they sat helplessly around the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding escaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant snuck up and--
",1449145,Amy,"  Surprise!
",129146,Kif," Amy? What are you doing here?
",319147,Amy," I forgot to give you something before you left.
",499148,Kif," What?
",79149,Amy," Is that your camouflage reflex or are you just happy to see me?
",659150,Kif," I love it out here, Amy. I feel so manly. I have a blister, I-I spit! A-And of course, I tell no one my feelings.
",1159151,Amy," But you still have them, right?
",339152,Kif," Oh, yes. But I keep them inside until I can write them in my diary.
",699153,Amy," Ah, it's a wonderful night.
",299154,Kif," It sure is. I could just lie here beside you staring at the sky all night.
",769155,Amy," I can't!  What's that?
",249156,Kif," Maybe we just made love.
",269157,Amy," The buggalo! They're in the crater.
",379158,Kif," The rustlers must have seen me coming and run off, scared.
",609159,Amy," Oh, Kif! You're so brave!
",279160,Kif,"  Sh! They'll hear us!
",239161,Kif," OK, the dynamite's in place.
",309162,Amy," Are you sure there's no other way to get the buggalo out?
",599163,Leela," Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal.
",749164,Amy," Well, actually--
",189165,Bender," Too late! This is more fun!
",299166,Amy," Kif! You did it! But how did you know the dynamite would work?
",649167,Kif," I once took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune. The principle is essentially the same.
",1019168,Fry," Hey, it's that ""barbecue's over"" sound again.
",479169,Leela,"  Sandstorm!  We're in the eye of the storm!
",459170,Fry," Where?
",89171,Bender," What's that?
",149172,Fry," My God!
",99173,Leela," Who are they?
",159174,Singing Wind," Fehk! We are the Native Martians.
",359175,Fry," Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly.
",409176,Singing Wind," Only those who revere Mother Mars can fly buggalo. And only they shall have buggalo. And they're us.
",1029177,Kif," But your, um, Martian-ness, these buggalo aren't yours. They belong to the Wong family.
",899178,Singing Wind," You mean family that took all Martian land and gave us one lousy bead?
",729179,Amy," Uh-huh! Amy Wong.  And you are?
",339180,Singing Wind," Mad at Wong family! We plan to ruin them by stealing buggalo. But now we take girl instead.
",939181,Amy," Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped!
",379182,Kif," Amy! Nooo!
",129183,Bender," Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you.
",889184,Leo," Hooray! You bring back cattle.
",329185,Kif," Yes ... but ... I'm afraid I've got some bad news as well.
",609186,Mrs. Wong," Let Amy tell us. That way it soften the blow.  Why Amy being so quiet?
",729187,Kif," Um ... well, um ... that is, um...
",369188,Leo," Oh, no! Martians kidnap Amy!  I know it them 'cause they no use good grammar.
",799189,Kif," I'll get your daughter back, sir. I swear.
",449190,Leo," Forget it, squishy. You the one lose her in first place. You done enough.
",759191,Mrs. Wong," Yeah. This time we get most decorated law man in the whole universe!
",709192,Kif," You mean-- Oh, no, please. I beg you! Oh, for the love of--
",619193,Zapp," I am the man with no name. Zapp Brannigan, at your service!
",619194,Mrs. Wong," Please, Mr. Brannigan, we need you go get our daughter back.
",629195,Zapp," Very well. I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go bargain with the Martian's personally.  Your gasps intrigue me. Explain.
",1229196,Leo," Martians have no land. They been gently encouraged to live on reservation deep underground. No one ever dare go there.
",1209197,Farnsworth," This mission is incredibly dangerous. Someone's sure to be killed. Fry, Leela, Bender--
",899198,Bender," Damn you, old man!
",209199,Leela," Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif!
",369200,Zapp," I didn't realise you were bringing your girlfriend, lieutenant!
",659201,Kif," She won't leave me alone.
",279202,Zapp," Did I say ""girlfriend""? She sounds more like a wife!
",549203,Zapp," Behold: The Great Stone Face of Mars.
",399204,Fry," Hm.
",59205,Zapp," The only known entrance to the Martian reservation.
",539206,Leela," What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?
",419207,Zapp," Well, yeah, but it's way over the other side of the planet.
",619208,Zapp," Nose-ward, ho!
",169209,Singing Wind," Fehk! I am Singing Wind, chief of the Martian tribe.
",549210,Zapp," Take me to your leader.
",259211,Singing Wind," Moving along. Why you trespass on our land?
",459212,Zapp," We come to negotiate the release of Amy Wong. And just to clarify: Land is the stuff that has sky over it.
",1089213,Leela," They have such respect for the planet.
",409214,Martian #1," Cynthia used to drink Slurm.
",309215,Singing Wind," We will give back girl when we get back planet surface.
",579216,Zapp," How do we even know she's alive?
",349217,Amy," I'm fine.
",119218,Zapp," Sh! You're weakening our bargaining position. How about instead you give us the girl and we carve a bunch of our presidents into your sacred mountain?
",1529219,Singing Wind," You waste words. We want return of land that was taken from us.
",659220,Bender," Uh, actually you traded it for a bead.
",409221,Singing Wind," Tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse. We want land back!
",599222,Zapp," Chief, my people are a people of law. And that law is ...  ... no backsies!
",779223,Singing Wind," The time for stupid statements is over!
",419224,Zapp," Oh, boy!
",109225,Leela," Ow, ow, ow, ow! My eye!
",259226,Zoidberg,"  Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch!
",309227,Kif," Amy, no! It's too windy!  Stay calm, dearest! I'll save you!
",629228,Amy," Kif!  You're flying Betsy!
",289229,Kif," Need a lift?
",149230,Singing Wind," Great Mother Mars! He has the gift!
",379231,Leela," Yay, Kif!
",119232,Zapp," Kroker, that was one Brannigan-esque feat of heroism!
",559233,Singing Wind," We have misjudged you, green one. You fly the buggalo like us. You have true reverence for Mother Mars. Let there be peace between us.
",1369234,Martian #2," Yes. Let us smoke-em peace pipe.
",349235,Kif," Smoke-em?
",119236,Singing Wind," Here, take.
",139237,Kif," Ooh, no thanks. I'm on the peace patch.
",419238,Singing Wind," You must smoke peace pipe, and you must do it peacefully. Or we'll kill you.
",789239,Kif," Well, it's just really that I don't feel that--
",499240,Zapp," Don't be such a chicken, Kif. Teenagers all smoke and they seem pretty on-the-ball.
",859241,Fry," Yeah!
",79242,Zapp," Yes, sir!
",119243,Bender," Way to suck it!
",179244,Kif," Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest!  Oh, monkey trumpets!
",599245,Singing Wind," You have coughed at our offer of peace. So you must die!
",589246,Martian #3," The very bead used to crush our dreams shall be used to crush your bones.
",759247,Kif," Well, actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--
",959248,Fry," Wait. That's the bead you traded your land for?
",499249,Leela," It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune.
",629250,Singing Wind," Really?
",99251,Bender," Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!
",599252,Amy," Y'know, if you still want your land, we could just trade back for it.
",719253,Singing Wind," Hmm. We always thought bead was worthless. We assumed our ancestors were cheated because they not have concept of ownership.
",1269254,Bender," So we can have the diamond?
",299255,Singing Wind," No. We do have concept of ownership. You are free to go. Sorry about all the rustling and kidnapping.
",1039256,Leela," But what about your sacred land?
",349257,Singing Wind," Land shmand! We don't wanna live on this planet. It's a dump. We'll buy new planet and act like it's sacred. With cash like this, who's going to argue? Nobody, that's who!
",1739258,Amy," Then Kif flew Betsy, rescued me from the tornado and made peace with the Martians.
",849259,Leo," Please! He too much of a wimp.
",329260,Mrs. Wong," Yeah. I'm sure it was all Mr. Zapp Brannigan here.
",529261,Zapp," Please, you give me too little credit.
",409262,Zoidberg," Captain Brannigan, you're always welcome here at Rancho Zoidberg!
",679263,Zoidberg," Money doesn't make good people, no, siree!
",449264,Amy," Thanks for saving my life, Kif. You're my hero.
",499265,Kif," Oh, you're kind. But your parents still don't like me.
",569266,Amy," Well globviously! But if they liked you then I wouldn't. Don't you know anything about girls?
",959267,Kif,"  Dear diary, I just made love for the second time!
",529268,Announcer #1,"  Futurama is brought to you by ...  ... Thompson's Teeth: The only teeth strong enough to eat other teeth.
",1089269,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Today marks our dear friend Dr. Zoidberg's 10th year with Planet Express. Huzzahs are in order.
",1189270,Fry,"  Huzzah!
",109271,Leela,"  Huzzah!
",109272,Amy,"  Huzzah!
",109273,Zoidberg," Hooray for me! Hooray for Zoidberg!
",379274,Hermes," I will now read the mandatory speech.   Dear employee. Has it really been five, 10 or 15 years? If not, please disregard this and get back to work. Distribute token of appreciation and applaud.
",1959275,Zoidberg," Look! Coupons! I can get two oil changes for the price of one! Now if I could only afford the one ... and the car. Ah, the years! So many memories, so many strange fluids gushing out of patients' bodies--
",2069276,Hermes," Yes, yes. Now here's your pension statement.  It's empty because you haven't paid into it, you dumb stinkbug!
",1119277,Zoidberg," You kept track of it all these years!
",399278,Fry," Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?
",889279,Bender," I thought you were retired.
",299280,Fry," Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age.
",499281,Bender," I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to ""off"".
",569282,Fry," Well I'm gonna take action. It's time to check on my retirement fund.  Damn! Still only $100.
",959283,Franklin,"  A penny saved is a penny earned. Also, could you get some athlete's foot cream for my face?
",949284,Fry," He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely.
",489285,Fry," Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket.  Cherry.  Cherry!  Mule. Crud!
",749286,Bender," So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles.
",709287,Teller," You're opening a retirement account for $6? I'm sure a wealthy ...  ... mule farmer like yourself is aware that we charge a $10 monthly fee.
",1429288,Fry,"  You gotta spend money to make money.
",399289,Teller," Here you are, sir. Your account is now overdrawn by $4.
",579290,Robot #1," Gee, I've seen lines move faster in a sperm bank.
",519291,Bender," That's for sure--  Roberto! Is that you?
",429292,Roberto," Bender! Hey, man!
",199293,Bender," You old lunatic! How you been?
",329294,Roberto," Not bad, not bad.  Everybody on the floor! This is a stick-up!
",649295,Bender," Yeah, I'm doing OK too.  I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex.
",849296,Roberto," Cool. Ca-Can you give me a hand here?
",399297,Bender," Sure thing, pal.
",189298,Roberto," Hey, you! Red!  Quit watering that plant and get the door!
",609299,Bender," Well, nice talking to you.
",289300,Roberto," Same here.  You guys are alright! Here's something for your trouble.
",709301,Bender," Hey, thanks, buddy!
",219302,Smitty," Freeze, punks! You're under arrest!
",379303,Nixon,"  Shoot them in the back! Quick! While they're not looking!
",609304,Bailiff," Court is in session. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding.
",619305,Whitey," The charge is bank robbery. Now, my caddie chauffeur informs me that a bank is a place where people put money that isn't properly invested. Therefore, robbing a bank is tantamount to that most heinous of crimes, theft of money.
",2299306,Hyper-Chicken," As the surveillance camera for the bank what all the judge was a-jawing about, could y'all tell us what you done seen the day of the crime?
",1419307,Camera," Well, let's see. My memory's a little fuzzy, but it went exactly like this:
",779308,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, I move that I be disbarred for introducing this evidence against my own clients.
",959309,Hyper-Chicken," Mr. Fry, do you recognise the robot a-huggin' on you in this here hologram?
",779310,Fry," I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as long as I live. And that name is--
",1049311,Leela,"  Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!
",669312,Fry," You're right. You're right. It was--
",389313,Whitey," Yes? What? You say if I testify I'll be killed? Oh. It's for you.
",679314,Roberto,"  ...and the other hamburger will...
",379315,Roberto," ...also be made of your lungs. So long, pal.
",469316,Fry," I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patty.
",849317,Whitey," Ah, the 67th Amendment.
",259318,Hyper-Chicken," I may be a simple country Hyper-Chicken but I know when we're finger-licked. Whattya say we plead insanity?
",1099319,Bender," A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.
",729320,Hyper-Chicken," If you start now, it might help our case.
",439321,Whitey," Counselor, what evidence do you offer to support this new plea of insanity?
",779322,Hyper-Chicken," Well, for one, they done hired me to represent them.
",549323,Whitey," Insanity plea is accepted. Mr. Bender, I hereby commit you to the asylum for criminally insane robots until such time as you are deemed cured.
",1449324,Bender," Yahoo! The system fails again!
",329325,Whitey," And, Mr. Fry, I sentence you to the home for criminally insane humans.
",729326,Bailiff," Your Honour, that facility has been full ever since you ruled that being poor is a mental illness.
",1009327,Whitey,"  Order! Order! The only poor people I want to hear about are the people who tend to my pores at the spa. Just send them both to the robot loony bin and let's go.
",1639328,Fry,"  Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!
",549329,Farnsworth," Keep your chin up!
",209330,Fry,"  Ow! My chin!
",159331,Fry," I don't belong here, Bender. This is an asylum for insane robots!
",679332,Bender," Well, you meet half the qualifications.
",419333,Fry," Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine my fragile, naked, pink body, they'll see I'm not a--
",959334,Fry," What the--
",129335,Bender,"  I find that offensive!
",259336,Dr. Perceptron," Greetings. I am Dr. Perceptron. Let me give you something to help you relax.
",789337,Fry," Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See?  I'm all squishy and flabby. Also, I complain a lot.
",1179338,Dr. Perceptron," Yes, you do. You need to relax more.  Terrific. Now, consider the following: You were admitted to this robot asylum. Therefore, you must be a robot. Diagnosis complete.
",1709339,Fry," I do other human stuff! I age! See?
",379340,Nurse Ratchet," I'm Nurse Ratchet. Please come with me, won't you?
",529341,Nurse Ratchet," We'll meet your roommate next, shall we? His name is Malfunctioning Eddie.
",769342,Fry," The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices really were insane.
",619343,Nurse Ratchet," He's very excitable.  So don't say anything to surprise him.
",629344,Malfunctioning Eddie," Pleased to meet you.
",229345,Fry,"  Actually, we've met once before.
",359346,Malfunctioning Eddie," What?
",79347,Hairbot," I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl.
",589348,Bender," Whoa! Someone had a busy day.
",319349,Fry," My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm human?
",819350,Bender," You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.
",399351,Fry," I don't wanna!
",169352,Unit 3," Hey, man. I believe you're a human.
",379353,Fry," You do?
",99354,Unit 3," Sure. They don't believe I'm a human either. Name's Unit 2013. C'mon. Lemme introduce you around.  Fry, meet Norm. How's it going, pal? Still picking up transmissions from the CIA on your teeth?
",1969355,Norm," They just won't stop!
",239356,Woman #1,"  The CIA cafeteria menu for the week of May 15th is as follows: Monday, shepherd's pie. Tu--
",949357,Unit 3,"  Cuckoo!
",109358,Fry," Let me guess, he thinks he's Lincoln?
",399359,Unit 3," Well, he's supposed to. Problem is he's got multiple personalities -- all of them Lincoln.
",929360,Lincolnbot," I was born in 200 log cabins.
",319361,Unit 3," And this here is Frankie. He's convinced he's a lunchroom worker, so they put him to work in the lunchroom.  How is work in the lunchroom, Frankie?
",1499362,Frankie,"  It's alright.
",169363,Unit 3," Poor Frankie!
",159364,Mad Hatterbot," Change places!
",169365,Fry," Bender, I can't take much more of this! I want outta here!
",609366,Bender," Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it, two Lincolns for every Napoleon.  Ah! Sweet light crude!
",1299367,Fry," But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos -- and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die here!
",1689368,Bender," Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot.
",539369,Mad Hatterbot," Change places!
",169370,Victor," The doctor says you are making great strides with your exploding problem.
",759371,Malfunctioning Eddie," Well, the way I see it--
",269372,Fry," You gotta get me out of here. I would have starved to death if not for that sick vending machine robot.  Gimme! Gimme!
",1209373,Hermes," Poor Fry! He's got the munchies for freedom!
",469374,Leela," We're all trying to help you. We've petitioned the governor but he doesn't want to appear soft on people who've been falsely imprisoned.
",1389375,Fry," At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all.
",719376,Bender," Je suis Napoleon!  No, seriously, I'm not.
",449377,Amy," Bender! You should be more ashamed of yourself than usual.
",609378,Bender," Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time using humour.
",869379,Nurse Ratchet," Visiting hours are over. Time for our medication disks.
",579380,Fry,"  Help me! For God's sake, help me!
",369381,Farnsworth," Oh, don't worry, Fry. I too once spent a nightmare-ish time in a robot asylum. But now it's nearly over. So long.
",1159382,Fry,"  Thirty days hath September, April, June and ... wonder ... is that peanut butter ... what am I gonna do?   Oh, God! What? What? What is it now?
",1469383,Dr. Perceptron," You are being released.
",259384,Fry," Finally! Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy justice!
",479385,Dr. Perceptron," Not you. Him.
",159386,Malfunctioning Eddie," Me? What a surprise.  Look!
",299387,Malfunctioning Eddie," I barely exploded at all.
",279388,Dr. Perceptron," We can control that with medication.
",389389,Nurse Ratchet," Fry? Are we ready to meet our new roommate?
",459390,Roberto," Hi, Red!
",109391,Fry," Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?
",419392,Roberto," I got busted robbing that bank again.
",399393,Fry,"  Why would you hold up the same bank twice?
",459394,Roberto," Ah, that first time was just to case the joint and rob it a little.  What's the matter? You scared?
",1019395,Fry," N-- N-- N--
",139396,Roberto," Noticeably? I'll say! Now stand back, I gotta practise my stabbing.
",699397,Fry," No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!
",369398,Bender,"  Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!
",519399,Roberto," Jeez, Red. Quit cowering. You call yourself a robot?
",549400,Fry," I'm not a robot!  I'm not a robot!
",369401,Dr. Perceptron," In answer to your question, Hermes, yes, your friend is cured.
",649402,Hermes," Oh!
",59403,Farnsworth," What a relief!
",169404,Leela," Thank God!
",129405,Dr. Perceptron," You'll notice he no longer suffers delusions of humanity.
",599406,Fry,"  Affirmative. I feel nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep ...
",669407,Leela," You've made a terrible mistake. He's a human being, not a machine. Oh, Fry!
",779408,Bender,"  Gonna sing a little tale about a battle called Waterloo.  Bonjour, y'all!
",769409,Zoidberg," Listen to me, Fry. Just because you think you're a robot, doesn't make you a robot. After all, I think I'm a doctor but that doesn't make me a doctor. These fancy clothes do!
",1769410,Fry,"  Negative. I must be a robot. Why else would human women refuse to date me?
",779411,Leela," Oh, lots of reasons.
",229412,Fry,"  Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment.
",1009413,Bender," Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!
",339414,Commentator,"  And down the stretch, it's Daddy's Little Grandpa, followed by Perennial Loser, and bringing up the rear, it's Lasty!
",1209415,Bender," Come on, Lasty!
",179416,Roberto," Hey, Bender.
",149417,Bender," Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do you?
",1629418,Roberto," Yeah, yeah. Now lie down and play dead. And don't ham it up!
",629419,Bender," Uh, sure.  Anything for you, buddy.
",379420,Roberto," Wait here, Bender. I need to get a disguise.
",469421,Bender," Uh, what's with the get-up?
",299422,Roberto," I'm in disguise 'cause I'm thinking of escaping. You in? Or do I gotta kill you so you don't squeal?
",1029423,Bender," I'm in! I'm in!  So when were you planning the breakout?
",589424,Roberto," I'm thinking maybe a few seconds ago.
",399425,Bender," Quick! Let's keep escaping!
",299426,Hermes," Times two, carry the one...
",299427,Fry," Oh, you sad, worthless human.
",319428,Hermes," What are ya-- Sacred hog of Prague! That was my anniversary gift to LaBarbara!
",809429,Fry," Fear not! For I shall assist ye!
",349430,Hermes," Robots don't say ""ye""!
",249431,Fry," Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs.  What is the meaning of this symbol?
",1089432,Hermes," That's a plus sign, you pointy-haired loony! Quit thinking you're a robot!
",769433,Fry," I'll show ye!
",159434,Fry," Stand back. I'm a tool-bot.
",299435,Leela," You're not a tool-bot. You're not a food-motron. You're not a robot of any kind.
",829436,Fry," Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet.
",659437,Leela," OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
",929438,Farnsworth," You're going to do his laundry?
",339439,Leela,"  Fry, this is for you.
",249440,Fry," Beep.
",79441,Leela," Oh, for God's sake!
",219442,Zoidberg," By a scallop's forelocks! What's with all the beer, Fry?
",589443,Fry,"  Alcohol fuels my power cells.  And as a mighty robot, I--  Beep.
",679444,Roberto," Thanks for helping me escape, Bender.
",399445,Bender," Oh, it was nothing.
",219446,Roberto,"  It was not nothing!  I wanna repay you. Let me get you something in here.
",769447,Roberto,"  Hands up! This is a stick-up again!
",389448,Bender," Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto.
",729449,Roberto," Gimme the remaining dough. And the calendars ... and that pen. Try to tear it so most of the beads are on my end!
",1159450,URL," Police! You're busted!
",249451,Smitty," And don't try anything. This glass here is laser-proof.  Fire lasers!  Duck! Lasers!
",869452,Bender," Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.
",599453,Amy," Aw! He looks like a little insane drunken angel.
",509454,Bender,"  Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto.
",459455,Hermes," Hey, mon.
",119456,Roberto," Nice to meet you.
",199457,Smitty,"  Come out with your hands up.
",319458,Roberto,"  Hostages!
",129459,Roberto," Back off! I got hostages!
",279460,Zoidberg," Hooray! I'm helping!
",229461,Smitty,"  Do you have any better hostages?
",359462,Roberto," To show them who's crazy, I'm gonna execute some of you. How 'bout you?
",739463,Farnsworth," Ouch! That's going to bleed when my heart beats.
",509464,Leela," Wait! Take me first!
",229465,Bender," Yes! Take her first.
",229466,Roberto," Shut up! Stop telling me how to do this!
",429467,Zoidberg," Oh, the fear!
",159468,Roberto," I'm thinking of a number between one and ten. Guess it and you die first. Go!
",799469,Bender," Um ... OK. Fifty ... six ... ish?
",359470,Roberto," 56? 56? Oh, man! Now that's all I can think about! I'm gonna kill you, you ... no good ... 56-ing--
",1019471,Bender," Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come down with Stockholm Syndrome ... handsome!
",849472,Fry," Halt, fellow robot!
",219473,Roberto," Hey, Red. You're just in time to join the hostage situation. Which side you wanna be on?
",909474,Fry," The side that kicks your twisted, metal ass!
",469475,Leela," Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful.
",369476,Fry," Negative, bossy meat creature. I know now what my primary function is: I am a battle-droid. Sworn to protect the weak from crazy robots.
",1389477,Roberto," I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy! I'm just not user-friendly!
",659478,Hermes," Fry! Don't be a hero! It's not covered by the health plan!
",609479,Roberto," Let's see how much of a robot you really are!
",479480,Fry," No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armour.
",479481,Roberto," Help! Help! He is a battle-droid! Somebody help me! Mommy! I'm sorry I spilled the transmission fluid, Mommy! No! No! Don't weld me to the wall, Mommy!
",1539482,Smitty,"  We're willing to listen to your demands.
",439483,URL," Hey, baby. Wash that off before you put it back.
",509484,Hermes," Who's brave now?
",189485,Amy," Hooray!
",99486,Zoidberg," Bravo!
",89487,Leela," You did it, Fry.
",189488,Bender," Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race.
",539489,Fry,"  It was nothing. I--   Blood? Robots don't have blood. I must be a, a--
",739490,Zoidberg," A squid?
",109491,Fry," A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!
",359492,Zoidberg," Also good.
",129493,Leela," Thanks for saving us, Fry.
",289494,Fry," I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again.
",529495,Bender," Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside, you've got the heart of a robot.
",889496,Fry," Aw. Thanks, Bender.
",219497,Bender," Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human.  What?
",609498,Bender,"  What?
",89499,Bender," Ah, beer! So many choices, and it makes so little difference.
",639500,Fry," How 'bout LÃ¶brau? It has dots on it.
",389501,Bender," Overruled. The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot!
",579502,Fry," I can't drink that! The metal shavings make my throat bloody.
",639503,Bender," Baby wants a Zima!
",209504,Leela," Hey, hey! We can all fight when we're drunk. Now, listen, why don't we just brew our own beer?
",969505,Bender," You can brew your own beer?
",299506,Leela," Sure. The kids at the orphanarium used to do it all the time.
",639507,Hermes," Cursed bacteria of Liberia. My own son, suspended from boarding school.
",739508,Dwight," It's not my fault, Dad.
",259509,Farnsworth," And you, Cubert! I cloned you from one of my warts and I can send you straight back in there.
",959510,Cubert," Nuh-uh!
",99511,Zoidberg," What's going on? Is this angry yelling or busted-hearing-aid yelling?
",719512,Hermes," I'm afraid it's both.
",239513,Farnsworth,"  What?
",89514,Labarbara," Now hold on. Everyone, cool your daiquiris! Let's give the little vermin a chance to explain themselves.
",1069515,Dwight," It was self defence, Mom. Just look at this letter the principal sent.  We were in science class and we had just finished building a miniature black hole.
",1569516,Cubert,"  That was easy.
",179517,Brett,"  Pretty scrawny black hole. It must be hungry.
",489518,Cubert,"  Duh! Black holes don't need food.
",369519,Brett,"  Neither do nerds!
",209520,Dwight,"  My Manwich!
",149521,Cubert,"  That's it, Bret. You've compressed our lunches to a singularity for the last time! Salt him, Dwight!
",1039522,Brett,"  When I re-solidify, I'm gonna put you in a world of goop!
",609523,Cubert," See? That bully started it. We couldn't fight back with brawn so we used our brains!
",869524,Farnsworth," I've warned you not to use those things!
",429525,Leela," Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops. We just need a big disposable tub to mix it in.
",909526,Bender," Yo!
",59527,Leela," Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.
",429528,Hermes," Dwight, you remember the crew.
",329529,Dwight,"  Eh.
",69530,Farnsworth," Crew, you remember Cubert?  Wonderful! Then I'm sure you won't mind being their legal guardians for a month!
",1109531,Cubert," Well, well.  If it isn't my old friend, stretch pants ...  ... no pants and ...  ... idiot!
",939532,Bender," We're making beer. I'm the brewery.
",379533,Dwight," I heard alcohol makes you stupid.
",359534,Fry," No I'm ... doesn't.
",219535,Leela," Actually, Dwight, you're right. Alcohol is very, very bad ... for children. But once you turn 21 it becomes very, very good. So scram!
",1369536,Dwight," Aw, man!
",109537,Cubert," I'm sick of this.
",199538,Cubert," Hey, Dad. What useless contraption are you half-baking today?
",639539,Farnsworth," Eh, wha? Oh! This is my latest invention; a device that lets anyone sound exactly like me!
",929540,Cubert,"  Good news, everyone! I'm a horse's butt!
",439541,Farnsworth," I am? That's not good news at all, you little--
",499542,Dwight," What's this devices marketability? Who's the target consumer?
",639543,Farnsworth," There is no target consumer! Only targets. Targets that will tremble in fear as their new master hands down edicts in my glorious, booming voice!  Now quit pestering me, you scoundrels!
",1879544,Hermes,"  Stamp it, file it. Oh, yeah! Send it overnight!
",509545,Dwight," Can I collate that?
",219546,Hermes," No!
",59547,Cubert," Can I shred these contracts?
",309548,Hermes," No!
",59549,Dwight," Wow! A power-stamper!
",239550,Hermes," Now look at all the work I gotta do!  Ow!
",439551,Leela," Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your natural robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast.
",1199552,Bender," Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me?  It's so beautiful.
",779553,Leela," Talk to me.
",139554,Farnsworth,"  This is Professor Farnsworth. I have an important delivery for you and your dumb crew. You must deliver a pizza to Dogdoo 8, a planet at the edge of the universe.
",1659555,Cubert,"  Sorry I can't come down to say goodbye, but I'm busy inventing useless junk.
",799556,Dwight,"  And I smell bad.
",199557,Cubert," Hey!
",69558,Leela," If you were my kids, you'd get quite a talking to ... from your father ... when he got home from the Senate.
",1109559,Farnsworth," Oh, bother! What have they done now?
",389560,Bender," Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake pizza delivery.
",569561,Fry," The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7.
",739562,Hermes," Child man, is this true?
",269563,Dwight," Yeah, but why are you mad at us? Your dummy brigade wasted a week on an obviously fake mission.
",979564,Cubert,"  Plus, they're making bootleg beer inside company property!
",619565,Bender,"  Lies! Lies and slander!
",269566,Farnsworth," Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys have been underfoot long enough!
",1039567,Hermes," You jerked the words right outta my mouth. We're their fathers and it's high times we acted like it.
",1029568,Bender," Ooh-hoo! Here comes violence!
",319569,Hermes," Get a job, you lazy kids!
",279570,Bender," I guess if you want children beaten ...  ... you have to do it yourself.
",749571,Cubert," Come on, Dad, shuffle faster!
",319572,Dwight," You don't wanna miss the unveiling of our new company, do you?
",649573,Hermes," Company?  How cute! What will you be pedalling? Lemonade? Shoe shines? Cootie insurance?
",909574,Farnsworth," Perhaps they've constructed a teddy bear hospital!
",529575,Cubert," Actually, we're starting a competing delivery company.
",569576,Hermes," Welcome to the world of business!
",359577,Farnsworth," Who's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign? Nobody, that's who!
",799578,Dwight," But we already have a client signed up. We're delivering the Daily Supernova.
",799579,Hermes," So your delivery company is just a cute, harmless paper route?
",649580,Farnsworth," Phew!
",79581,Dwight," No! It's a serious business.
",309582,Farnsworth," Yes it's a tremendous responsibility, alright!  What if a paper were to land in a puddle?
",919583,Hermes," Civilisation as we know it might get splashed!
",489584,Dwight," Why do they always treat us like dumb kids? We're practically old enough to find the Fox Network infantile!
",1099585,Cubert," We'll show 'em. All Awesome Express needs is a sturdy interstellar delivery craft.  VoilÃ ! You got a quarter?
",1119586,Dwight," Man, the ad said to allow four to six seconds for delivery.
",619587,Cubert," More like seven!
",189588,Bender," I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.
",689589,Fry," No, you have a healthy glow.
",309590,Bender," Oh, my God! I just felt it ferment!
",379591,Leela," Ooh! Let me feel.  Have you thought about what to name it?
",609592,Bender," I was thinking ""Benderbrau"" if it's an ale, ""Botweiser"" if it's a lager.
",749593,Fry," I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game.  Ooh, I felt that one!
",779594,Cubert," Uh, there's a crack in the hull here. That could cause explosive decompression.
",819595,Dwight," Put a sticker on it.
",229596,Hermes," Off on your first delivery, eh? You be careful, my little tinkler.  Remember we used to call you that, huh? Tinkler?
",1189597,Sal," Gets movin'! Those newspapers won'ts deliver themselveses! Only the Sunday edition can dos that.
",989598,Farnsworth," Goodness, there must be 50 papers in that bundle! That's a big number, 50.
",769599,Cubert," Yeah, if you're an idiot!
",279600,Dwight," Three, two, one.
",189601,Cubert," All systems go.
",179602,Dwight," Blast-off!
",129603,Hermes,"  See you at din-din!
",229604,Farnsworth,"  I'm blowing you a kiss.
",269605,Cubert," Take evasive action!
",229606,Farnsworth,"  It's closing in! You can't avoid it! It's a cheek-seeker. And ... gotcha!
",769607,Cubert,"  Nooo!
",89608,Hermes," Business is down, so I filed papers to have you all reclassified as slaves.
",779609,Farnsworth," Well, well. If it isn't our little munchkin moguls!
",539610,Hermes," What's the trouble, men? Need some penny rolls for your profits?
",669611,Cubert," Actually, thanks to Dwight's brilliant accounting and my unaccountable brilliance ...  ... our paper route now has over a million customers!
",1429612,Dwight," We're finally making more money than you guys! Aren't you impressed now, Pops? Aren'tcha? Aren'tcha?
",1029613,Hermes," Uh, in a small way, yes. But you still don't have your own building or conference table or ... or one of those things!
",1209614,Zoidberg," Hello!
",89615,Dwight," Our dads are never impressed, no matter what we do.
",539616,Cubert," Maybe we should start a fire.
",319617,Dwight," If we really wanna impress them we'll have to crush them with strategy ... Dwight Lightning!
",949618,Cubert," Very well. But I get to name the next strategy.
",499619,Announcer #1,"  This week on The Real World: The Sun.
",409620,Man #1,"  I'm burning to death!
",249621,Leela," You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun?
",649622,Hermes," People, as you know, our young sons have become great successes in the very same field as us.
",959623,Bender,"  Alright!
",119624,Fry,"  That's great!
",169625,Leela,"  That's good!
",159626,Hermes," Naturally, we're humiliated.
",309627,Farnsworth," That's why we need you, our loyal crew, to make Planet Express 800% more profitable.
",869628,Hermes," We'll start by slashing salaries, and this time I mean really slashing.
",739629,Leela," Uh, guys, I don't know how to tell you this, so I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly.
",959630,Fry," We don't work for you anymore!
",329631,Farnsworth," What?
",79632,Leela," Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. We're paperboys now.
",649633,Cubert," Incoming! We got papers to stuff, team! Hup two, hup two!
",599634,Fry," Yes, sir.
",119635,Bender," Right away!
",139636,Leela," We're on it, Mr. Farnsworth.
",309637,Farnsworth," Folks, the situation is grim but we shall prevail, thanks to you, our crack team of loyal dregs!
",989638,Hermes," I don't even know who this guy is!
",369639,Scruffy," I'm Scruffy, the janitor.
",279640,Farnsworth," Yes, of course you are. Now we've got to buckle down and save Planet Express.
",799641,Scruffy," I'm on break.
",159642,Cubert," Sorry to interrupt this whirlwind of activity but we have an announcement.
",769643,Dwight," I direct your attention to these forms, which I'm presently engaged in handing to you.
",889644,Hermes," Sweet guinea pig of Winnipeg! They've taken over our company!
",639645,Farnsworth," Balderdash! I never agreed to that!
",379646,Dwight," No. But you did declare yourself dead three years ago as a tax dodge.
",719647,Farnsworth," Tax dodge, nothing! You take one nap in a ditch at the park and they start declaring you this and that.
",1059648,Cubert," Either way, I technically inherit your building and your spaceship, which means Planet Express is now ...  ... Awesome Express!
",1299649,Hermes,"  You rotten kids!  Will you be hiring?
",409650,Dwight," No.
",59651,Hermes,"  You rotten kids!
",199652,Fry," There. One million papers, folded and loaded!
",479653,Cubert," Hey, Leela, help me apply these flame decals I got in my cereal. They'll make the ship go faster.
",999654,Leela," And what's your scientific basis for thinking that?
",539655,Cubert," I'm 12.
",99656,Farnsworth," Oh, did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship?
",549657,Zoidberg," There but for the grace of God.
",339658,Bender,"  Hush, little brewski,
Don't you leak,
Daddy wants to drink for at least a week.  Oh, my God! I think it's time!
",1149659,Fry," Hurry, Leela! Get some coasters and cold mugs.
",489660,Fry," Push, Bender, push!
",219661,Leela," You're doing great!
",219662,Bender," It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed outta me.
",569663,Fry," Almost there. Just two more bottles.
",389664,Bender," Is it OK? I can't hear anything.
",349665,Fry," It's an ale! Five gallons, six ounces!
",409666,Dwight," Hey, what's goin' on? This is a delivery company not a delivery room!
",719667,Cubert," We just busted our bums delivering a million papers and this is how you greet us, with a bunch of frosty, cold beers?
",1199668,Fry," Hey, wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?
",719669,Cubert," Uh ... we just did, OK? 'Cause we're awesome! Yeah! Awesome.
",629670,Dwight," Yeah, awesome!
",169671,Leela," Hello, Awesome Express; the rude, crude delivery dudes. How may I direct your call? What's that? You haven't gotten your paper? In how long?
",1429672,Farnsworth," Uh, might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon? And another tequila slammer?  Please?
",1049673,Labarbara," Don't you sweet talk me, you wrinkly, old tube sack!
",549674,Hermes," Might I have one too, wife?
",299675,Labarbara," Oh, you're both pathetic, being jealous of your own offspring. Now you should be happy they became successes, instead of following in your foot stamps.
",1539676,Hermes," Oh, it's true. But they grow up so fast. We just wanted a few more years of being better than them.
",1019677,Farnsworth," They're so stinking talented, they don't even need their fathers anymore.
",759678,Cubert," Dad! We screwed up!
",219679,Farnsworth," You did? Tough luck, suckers!
",319680,Dwight," Please, help us, Pops. We agreed to deliver way more papers than we can handle.
",819681,Cubert,"  But we couldn't handle them, so we started dumping the extras in a crater on the Moon.
",899682,Dwight,"  And now everyone's yelling at us about our missing papers!
",619683,Cubert,"  And we don't know what to do!
",329684,Farnsworth," Why did you boys do all this?
",319685,Dwight,"  We just wanted you to be proud of us.
",409686,Hermes," Proud of you? You ruined us with sleazy business practices and a complete disregard for human decency. Of course we're proud of you!
",1349687,Farnsworth," Damn right we are! Now come on, let's go do a little father-son weaselling out of this.
",899688,Farnsworth,"  Good thing I had this net installed for catching giraffes.
",619689,Hermes," OK, boys, let me show you how a paper man does it.
",529690,Little Prince," Au revoir!
",129691,Dwight," Can I use the gun, Dad?
",259692,Hermes," Aw, what kind of father would I be if I said no?
",509693,Dwight," Only one house to go. We did it!  Run away! That bully, Bret Blob, lives there!
",819694,Cubert," He's ugly mean stupid stink mucus! And last week we sort of ... broke his window.
",839695,Hermes," Alright, alright. What do we do when we break somebody's window?
",669696,Dwight,"  Pay for it?
",149697,Hermes," Oh, heavens, no! We apologise, with nice, cheap words!
",569698,Brett," I thought I heard the doorbell but I see it was the dorkbell!
",639699,Dwight," Man, you're funny. Good one, Bret.
",369700,Farnsworth," Now, now, no need to give us the business. We'd like a word with you daddy.
",779701,Brett," Whatever.  Dad!
",179702,Hermes," Don't worry, boys. I'm sure his father is a perfectly normal, reasonable man.
",799703,H.G. Blob," What the hell do you want?
",289704,Farnsworth," Mr. Blob, our sons have come to apologise for damaging your window. They've learned their lesson and they want to make amends.
",1289705,Cubert," Sorry, sir.
",139706,Dwight," Yeah, sorry.
",149707,H.G. Blob," You can shove your apology into the bottom of your one-way digestive system.
",789708,Farnsworth," Now see here. We assured our sons that you'd accept their apology.
",689709,H.G. Blob," Aww. Tell you what, I'll accept their apology when they kiss my ass! Which I don't have!
",909710,Farnsworth," No one gives my boy that option!
",349711,Hermes," Bring it on, Jello-pop!
",259712,Cubert," Yeah, get him, Dad!
",219713,Dwight," Show 'em who's boss!  Get 'em ... Pops!
",419714,Cubert," Right.
",89715,Cubert," That was incredible! You are the bravest dads in the entire trauma centre!
",769716,Dwight," You guys almost had him ... until he digested you.
",529717,Hermes," Oh, you're good kids.  If I could feel anything right now, it would be pride.  I was wrong! I can still feel pain!
",1169718,Farnsworth," He's come to finish the job! Someone toss me out the window!
",629719,H.G. Blob," No, no, wait. I-I feel terrible about what happened. I-I've just been under a lot of stress lately down at the plant, y'know. They're-They're bringing in computers to ""improve productivity"" and, well, that's no excuse for how I acted. But the boy needs to see that real men solve their disagreements with words, not violence, so, uh, if you'll accept my apology, well, I hope we can put this embarrassing incident behind us.
",4269720,Farnsworth," I suppose.
",129721,Bender," Hey, chumps, I heard you were on the ass-end of an ass-kicking so I figured you could use a couple these little babies.
",1219722,Hermes," Oh, why not? Might as well live it up as long as I've got this catheter in me!
",809723,Farnsworth," Won't you join us, Mr. Blob?
",309724,H.G. Blob," Sounds like a plan!
",219725,Hermes," This is what makes life worth clinging to; three fathers enjoying a day out with their sons.
",949726,Farnsworth," It would seem we've taught our boys a lesson about life: Man or Blob, it's what's inside that counts.
",1039727,Bender,"  Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh
Well, Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride,
Blah, blah, blah, something, Bender is great!
Froggy went a-courtin' and Bender is great, uh-huh--
",2029728,Fry," Oh, my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time!  There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there.
",1209729,Bender," What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?
",679730,Fry," No, it's an old Volkswagen van.   Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old van?
",779731,Sal,"  Sure. You wanna dump the corpses out of theres, it's yourses.
",649732,Fry," Yeah, yeah, I've gotten used cars before.
",439733,Leela," What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?
",739734,Fry," It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite you to come a-knockin'!
",1039735,Amy," Wow, neat.
",129736,Hermes," It's a triumph of free-spirited German engineering.
",539737,Amy," Hey, the speedometer only goes up to 80. This thing can't go faster than 80,000 miles an hour?
",969738,Fry," No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player with genuine mono sound.
",979739,Farnsworth," Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?
",699740,Fry," Under the seat.
",179741,Leela," Why won't it start?
",219742,Fry," It just needs some gas.
",259743,Farnsworth," Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038.
",749744,Leela," Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels.
",749745,Fry," Like what?
",129746,Leela," Whale oil.  Bender, lift it up to the can opener.
",519747,Bender," Oh, no! I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off.
",889748,Fry," Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs.
",919749,Bender," What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.
",889750,Fry," Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing that can opener could ever do would be worse than that.
",1399751,Bender," OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans.
",609752,Leela," Come on!
",109753,Hermes," You can do it!
",169754,Amy," Bender!
",99755,Farnsworth," Go on, you dummy.
",199756,Bender,"  Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,
Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,
",769757,Fry," Oh, no!
",99758,Bender,"  Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,
Cause the master's gone away.
",699759,Zoidberg,"  It's toe-tapping-ly tragic.
",309760,Bender," Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?
",599761,Doctor," This is the worst part of the job.
",369762,Bender," What is it, good news?
",249763,Doctor," Bender, your hydraulics are shot. You'll never move again.
",609764,Bender," You mean--
",129765,Doctor," I'm sorry, you'll have to get a new one.
",429766,Fry," Oh, no! This is terrible.
",279767,Zoidberg," Poor Bender.
",149768,Farnsworth," Well, let's drag him to the kerb.
",359769,Fry," Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes.
",1019770,Bender,"  Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again.
",569771,Robot #1," Ho, ho! Hello there!
",229772,Leela," Look, Bender! It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter.
",759773,Patch Cord Adams," Come on, take it. What's the matter, can't move your arms?
",609774,Bender," Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now.
",529775,Patch Cord Adams," Hey, here's a giggle!  Did you hear why they're using Windows 3000 as a prison guard?
",879776,Fry," No, why?
",109777,Patch Cord Adams," 'Cause it always locks up.
",289778,Bender," For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!
",459779,Patch Cord Adams," Well, so long. Get well soon.  Oh, well, so long anyway.
",589780,Bender," Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way.
",759781,Fry," Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?
",689782,Bender," Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people's suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up.  Wow, that was great.
",1149783,Beck," Hey, thanks. You a fan?
",259784,Bender," I dunno. Let me see.  Oh, my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me.
",1389785,Beck," Don't take it so hard. I used to miss my body too but then I fished this mannequin out of the 92c Store dumpster.
",1159786,Bender," Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you.
",1519787,Beck," So do it, robot. It's easier than it looks.
",459788,Bender," Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now.
",629789,Beck," Or maybe you'll be the best musician ever.
",449790,Bender," What's this for?
",189791,Beck," Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast.  Come on, move those arms. Use the power of mental thinking. Make it dynamic.  Yeah-ee! Alright, congratulations, my friend.
",1919792,Bender," Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?
",419793,Beck," Exactly. I use those all the time in my music. Bender, I want you to become my new washboard player.
",1029794,Bender," Alright!  Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
",449795,Bender," Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm off to rock a series of mid-level venues.
",829796,Hermes," Kudos, Bender. You got mangled and now you're a singer. Both our dreams came true.
",849797,Fry," Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on tour and live there, in the van?
",1049798,Zoidberg," Oh, I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too poor to follow a band around in a van.
",799799,Beck,"  Come on, move it! We gotta get to the concert and make the audience wait for it at the start.
",969800,Zoidberg," Bad news, friends. My shell ran.
",349801,Amy," Zoidberg, you idiot, my outfit. It's, it's--
",469802,Leela," Kinda cool.
",139803,Fry," Yeah, I like it.
",189804,Amy," Me too, now that I'm used to it.
",349805,Zoidberg," Then it was all on purpose! You're lucky to have Zoidberg as a friend. But cross me, and I'll turn on you like that!
",1189806,Beck,"  There's a destination a little up the road,
From the habitations and the towns we know,
A place we saw the lights turn low,
The jigsaw jazz and the get-fresh glow,
Pullin' out jives and jamboree handouts,
Two turntables and a microphone,
Bottles and cans just clap your hands,
Just clap your hands.
",3019807,All,"  Where it's at!
",179808,Bender,"  Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.
",449809,Beck," That was a washboard break.
",299810,Fry," Oh, yeah!
",119811,Amy," Yeah!  One bowl of Jell-O knuckles, please.
",459812,Barman," That'll be three pick-e-tures of George Washington.
",539813,Amy," Oh, no! My beautiful money.
",299814,Leela," It got ruined in the wash.
",289815,Fry," Mine too, even my change.
",279816,Barman," Get lost, you money-less hippies!
",359817,Horrible Gelatinous Hick," You heard him, freaks. We don't like your type around here. These are the types we like.
",909818,Beck," Bender, that was the best 40-minute washboard solo I've ever heard. And the parts when I was awake blew my mind.
",1149819,Bender," Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!
",579820,Robot #1 #1," I don't believe my broken eyes! It's Bender, the washboard player! Hey, man, we caught your concert from here.
",1129821,Robot #1 #2," You rock!
",119822,Fembot #1," Oh, oh, Bender! Sign my chest! It's in that bin behind me.
",609823,Robot #1 #3," Yo, brother, thanks for showing that broken robots are still useful.
",709824,Bender," Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be--  That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass.
",1729825,Beck," Whoa, dog. Just cold chill.  You know, when I'm upset, I write a song about it. Like when I wrote Devil's Haircut, I was feeling really-- What's that song about?
",1639826,Bender," Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phoney ones like ""odelay"".
",829827,Beck," ""Odelay"" is a word. Just look it up in the Becktionary.
",579828,Bender," Ooh!
",69829,Bender," I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary.  No, no, the rhyming Becktionary.
",849830,Beck," I wish I could help raise awareness about broken robots. But what can I do? I only weigh eight pounds.
",1049831,Bender," Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look like they care about things!
",1049832,Beck," We can all get together for a big benefit concert in San Francisco!
",699833,Bender," And we could call it ""Bend-Aid"", after me, Bender!
",529834,Beck," And you can sing that song you're writing!
",449835,Bender," And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me: Bender.
",739836,Bender," Alright. ""Hands in the air"" rhymes with ""Just don't care"" and ... finished!  Eck! Smells like something died in the wall!
",1239837,Fry," Surprise!
",119838,Leela," Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake.
",779839,Bender," Alright, but hands off the minibar.
",379840,Fry," Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much better life is without it. Well, let's see what's on.
",1259841,Announcer #1 #1,"  Tuesday, Golden Gate Park, the monsters of vaguely-folkish alterna-rock will strum your brains out at Bend-Aid! Featuring Beck, Wailing Fungus and special guest, Bender!
",1729842,Announcer #1 #2,"  A portion of the proceeds might go to help broken robots.
",609843,Fry," Yeah!
",79844,Zoidberg," Hooray, robot!
",169845,Amy," Bender, you're famous!
",249846,Bender," Yeah.
",79847,Leela," This coming-together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?
",839848,Bender,"  Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now: I've got fame, money, groupies, and it's all thanks to being completely immobilised.  That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage tomorrow and say, ""Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!"".
",3799849,Fry," Bender, you can move! You're cured!
",379850,Bender," Oh, crap! It's a miracle!
",279851,Bender," I can move again.  My music career is over.
",459852,Fry," Bender, I don't claim to understand ""the biz"" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?
",1039853,Bender,"  No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish.  Wait, that's it! I'll fake it!
",2119854,Amy," You'd better not do that at the concert.
",429855,Zoidberg," I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, I get stuff in my throat.
",679856,Amy," You are so disgusting, I--
",289857,Leela," They're beautiful.
",209858,Zoidberg," Ew, you're touching them!
",279859,Amy," I've never seen pearls like this. Dr. Zoidberg, you're amazing.
",659860,Zoidberg," I am? At last! Recognition!
",299861,Emcee,"  Gentle hippies, put your filthy hands together for the folk stylings of Cylon and Garfunkel!
",959862,Garfunkel," Here's a song that was beautiful when performed by my ancestor, Art.
 Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
",1069863,Cylon," and   Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.
",429864,Garfunkel,"  Remember me to one who loves there.
",389865,Cylon," and   She once was a true love of mine.
",419866,Leela," We're home.
",139867,Amy," Well, let's earn some bread.
",309868,Fry," Brothers and sisters, get your love beads. Can't journey to the centre of your mind without love beads!
",1059869,Hippie #1," Wow, look at the colours. These'll go great with my soul.
",599870,Zoidberg," Glad you like them. I've been making fine jewellery for years, apparently.
",769871,Hippie #2," I'll take three.
",189872,Hippie #3," Give me one, man!
",199873,Hippie #4," I'll trade you a bad poem!
",289874,Emcee,"  And now, stand up and turn on your hidden tape recorders for ... Beck! With special guest, Bender, the broken robot.
",1199875,Fry,"  Bender rules!
",169876,Hippie #5," Groove on, man!
",179877,Leela," Rock it, Bender!
",189878,Zoidberg," Play that thing!
",189879,Beck,"  Can't you hear those cavalry drums,
Hijacking your equilibrium...
",689880,Bender," Whoa-oh, yeah!
",169881,Beck,"  ...Midnight hags in the mausoleum,
",379882,Beck," Thank you. That song doesn't usually last three hours, but we got into a serious thing ... and then I forgot how it ended. Anyway, one last item of business before we go.
",1729883,Garfunkel," Bender, to start your foundation for broken robots, here's a big, cardboard cheque for $14,000.
",979884,Cylon," It's been an emotional day for me.
",369885,Bender,"  I don't know what to say.
",289886,Beck," Then maybe you should sing it. Lay it down, boys.
",519887,Bender," Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery ...  ... this is a song called My Broken Friend.
 People say my broken friend is useless,
But I say his mind is free,
There's lots of things my mangled robot friend could be,
",2229888,Beck," Kick it!
",109889,Bender,"  He could make a good...
",269890,Bender," and   ...hat-rack
",199891,Beck,"  He only has to stand there,
",309892,Bender,"  Or a cheap...
",169893,Bender," and   ...doorstop,
",209894,Beck,"  He doesn't need to move
",269895,Bender,"  Or a great big...
",209896,Bender," and   ...giant Thermos,
",259897,Bender,"  With a twist-off top,
",249898,Beck,"  That would be good for soup,
",319899,Bender,"  He could be a storage closet...
",349900,Bender," and   ...for outdated pants,
",309901,Beck," I like 'em tight!
",199902,Bender,"  My broken friend could do it all,
",369903,Bender," and   Just give him a chance!
",319904,Bender,"  That robot has a tragic secret,
That I'd like to share...
",609905,Beck," For real?
",119906,Bender,"  ...My broken friend is closer to me,
Than an ass to a chair...
",659907,Beck," Hm.
",59908,Bender,"  ...That robot's name I never told you...
",439909,Beck," Who's that?
",139910,Bender,"  ...You could not foresee...
",309911,Beck," C'mon, give it up.
",209912,Bender,"  ...I'll say it loud and sing it proud...
",439913,Bender," and   His name is you and me.
",319914,Bender,"  Don't melt me down into a crowbar,
",379915,Beck,"  It suffers alone,
",209916,Bender,"  Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs,
",459917,Beck," Hey.
",69918,Bender,"  Or toss me into a trash can...
",339919,Beck," Bender, what are you doing?
",299920,Bender,"  ...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs...
",509921,Beck," What are you doing?
",219922,Bender,"  ...Don't crush me into an anchor...
",389923,Beck," Yo! What's the dealy-o?
",259924,Bender,"  ...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing...
",529925,Beck," Hold it! What? No!
",209926,Bender,"  ...I'm telling you, my broken friend...
",429927,Beck," B-Bender.
",119928,Bender,"  ...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!
",579929,Beck," No!
",59930,Bender,"  I'm telling you, my broken friend...
",399931,Beck," Cut it!
",99932,Bender,"  ...Can do 'most anything!
",289933,Beck," Cut it!
",99934,Bender," Yeah!
",79935,Beck," Cut it!
",99936,Bender," Curse my natural showmanship!
",319937,Robot #1 #4,"  You big, fat fraud! You're not really broken!
",489938,Robot #1 #5,"  But you will be in a minute! Bum-rush the stage!
",519939,Robot #1 #6," Get him!
",109940,Hippie #6," Oh, harsh! I didn't get my beads.
",359941,Beck," You, minion, lift up my arm.  After him!
",429942,Bender," Well, everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers.
",709943,Caterpillar Alien," What is this? The Year of the Jerk?
",379944,Fry," Hurry! The Golden Gate Bridge! Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal.
",799945,Bender," Oh, no! I forgot this is a hoverbridge.
",419946,Leela," And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.
",379947,Fry," Is any of that a problem?
",279948,Zoidberg," Not if you've lived a life without regret.
",449949,Bender," I'll save me!
",159950,Leela," Quick, grab his footcups.
",279951,Bender," Hey? What? No.
",169952,Fry," Phew!
",79953,Leela," Bummer.
",99954,Bender,"  Someone fat get in my way!   I'm broken again. I can't move any part of me.
",789955,Beck," Good.
",79956,Bender," I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with you. I never meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone.
",1249957,Beck," Bender, that's some played-out, new-jack, horse crap-- But I know you don't mean it so apology accepted.
",1069958,Bender," So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?
",339959,Garfunkel," Over my dead career!
",229960,Bender," Well, it was worth a shot.
",289961,Fry,"  C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home.
",679962,Bender," Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up.
Fry cracked corn,
And I don't care,
Leela cracked corn,
I still don't care,
Bender cracked corn,
And he is great!
Take that, you stupid corn!
",2069963,Hermes," Go get it, boy!
",179964,Fry," So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're kinda dangerous but I finally mastered them.
",1199965,Leela," Those aren't swan boats, they're swans.
",419966,Fry," Oh. That explains these boat eggs.
",369967,Farnsworth," Wha?
",69968,Tate," Pitiful ballplayers of Earth, I am Ethan ""Bubblegum"" Tate, commander of the Harlem Globetrotters.  For generations, your puny planet has lived in peace with the Globetrotter Homeworld. But now, for no reason, we challenge you to defend your honour on the basketball court.  Will no one meet our challenge? Have none of you pathetic Earthlings game?
",3509969,Fry,"  What happens if we lose?
",279970,Tate," Nothing. There's nothing at stake and no threat, beyond the shame of defeat!
",789971,Farnsworth," This will not stand!  I'll take you on, you air-balling bozos.
",649972,Tate," You, old man? Sweet Clyde, laugh derisively at him.
",539973,Farnsworth," I may be an old man. In fact, I'm fairly sure I am. But I'll put you Globetrotters in your place with my team of mutant atomic supermen!
",1389974,Hermes," Hooray, Professor!
",209975,Farnsworth," Behold: My mutant atomic supermen.
",369976,Leela," They're only a foot high, Professor.
",389977,Farnsworth," Well, they're still young. Mere atomic super boys, really. We'll need to speed up their growth with time particles called Chronitons.
",1359978,Bender," Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisa--
",649979,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! You're off to the Tempus Nebula to gather Chronitons.
",769980,Fry," Hey, Leela, look at me!
",259981,Leela," Your face can take a lot of punishment. That's good to know.
",629982,Fry," There's a lot about my face you don't know! Perhaps you and it could get better acquainted over dinner.
",1059983,Leela," Alright! Cool your jets, hotshot.
",359984,Fry," C'mon, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there.
",839985,Leela," No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face.
",599986,Bender,"  Ow! Oh, my God! Ow!
",229987,Leela," Here you go. Hot off the nebula.
",349988,Farnsworth," None too soon. While you were gone the Trotters held a news conference to announce that I was a jive sucker.  Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants.
",1509989,Amy," Hi!
",59990,Arachneon,"  Hello!
",99991,Albert," Marv Albert here at Madison Cube Garden where the Harlem Globetrotters take on a squad of atomic supermen in what promises to be a by-the-numbers athletic contest with no surprises whatsoever.  Here's the tip-off. Globetrotter ball. Sweet Clyde Dixon to Bubblegum Tate. Drives down-court-- And Curly Joe from the rear.
",3209992,Zoidberg," That one grabbed his behindus!
",329993,Leela," Sh!
",59994,Hermes," Quiet!
",89995,Tate," Who dares laugh at the Jesters of Dunk? We came to terrify and humiliate you, not tickle your funnybones. Watch as I embarrass your civilisation by passing the ball to Curly Joe.  Only to have it remain in my hands with elastic.  And perhaps this will wipe the smiles from your faces.
",2869996,Albert," Goosh goes up.  Rejected! Grotrian from half-court.  Yes!
",599997,Albert," Supermen lead 45-42. Arachneon with the steal, to Thorias. Thorias from downtown!  Yes! He's really showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest can do!
",1589998,Farnsworth," No showboarding, you atomic hotdog!
",379999,Albert," And that's the half, with the Supermen up 48-42. Surprisingly dull, so far.  Bubblegum, the Trotters are down by six. Reactions?
",13010000,Tate," It was always our plan to trail at the half, thus deepening Earth's eventual humiliation. Also, what game were the refs watching?
",13110001,Albert," Curly Joe, easily amused by his own antics ...  ... continues to wreak havoc on--
",8310002,Farnsworth," What the--  Did everything just jump around, or did my brain just stroke off there for a second?
",9810003,Albert," Ladies and gentlemen, something very strange has just happened in this basketball game between space clowns and atomic monsters.
",13010004,Farnsworth," Time-out! Time-out!
",2110005,Fry," What's happening?
",1910006,Farnsworth," We seem to be lurching forward randomly in time, like a needle skipping on a record player.
",9310007,Amy," What's causing it? Is it my outfit?
",3710008,Farnsworth," No. It must have something to do with those time particles I used to grow the Supermen. Time and space are ripping apart at the seams.
",13610009,Thorias," Oops!
",710010,Farnsworth," Oh, great! Now, on top of everything, we need a new fifth man.
",6410011,Fry," Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Put me in, Professor. I wanna show Leela my skills.
",6810012,Farnsworth," Hmm. Will said skills pay the bills?
",3810013,Fry," Who cares? We're 35 points ahead with two minutes left. What could possibly--
",7910014,Albert," Globetrotters win, 244-86. A dark day for humanity, folks. We have been beaten ... in basketball.
",9910015,Curly Joe," Yeah, that's how we do it!
",2810016,Sweet Clyde," How's that?
",1310017,Tate," You are all fools of the highest calibre.
",4310018,Leela," I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again you screwed up. Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
",13110019,Hermes," I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.
",6210020,Farnsworth," Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes. We have bigger problems. This time disruption is extremely serious.
",11510021,Tate," Damn right, brother man. This chronological wang-dang-doodle could destroy the very matrix of reality.
",10410022,Farnsworth," Tate? What do you know about this?
",3610023,Tate," Not much, yet. But I am senior lecturer of physics at Globetrotter U. And I'd like to help you investigate.
",10910024,Farnsworth," You're that Bubblegum Tate?
",2910025,Tate," Well I sure ain't his grandma. Now look here, Prof.  I think we got ourselves an excess of Chronitons in the subatomic interstices.
",13310026,Farnsworth," Yes, I see. Something involving that many big words could easily destabilise time itself.
",9110027,Fry," Is that a problem?
",2010028,Farnsworth," Indeed so. At this rate, by Tuesday it will be Thursday; by Wednesday, it will be August; and by Thursday, it will be the end of existence as we know it.
",15510029,Man #1," I'll have to ask you to clear out now. The circus need to set up for tomorrow's big--
",8710030,Linda,"  Time continues to skip forward randomly. Details at 11.
",5810031,Linda,"  This is the news at 11. The mysterious and unexplained--
",5910032,Linda,"  Turning to entertainment news, teen singer Wendy might just be the latest--
",7810033,Linda,"  --won three Grammys last night--
",3510034,Linda,"  --found dead in her bathtub.
",3110035,Farnsworth," Interesting. It's as if we behave normally during the time skips, but then we have no memory of it.
",10110036,Fry," You mean we just--
",2010037,Farnsworth," My, yes. Ooh, just like that. Any luck, Bubblegum?
",5210038,Tate," Not yet. Listen, I hope you don't mind if I dribble a little while I work.
",7610039,Farnsworth," Not if you'll grant me the same liberty.
",4210040,Bender," Ooh! Ooh! Bubblegum? My name's Bender and I'm a huge fan of your work, both on and off the court. Can I be a Globetrotter?
",12410041,Tate," Shut up, turkey.
",1810042,Farnsworth," Bubblegum, look at this. The background time radiation is fluctuating wildly.
",7910043,Tate," Good Lord! That sucker's shaking around like some fine, imported booty.
",7310044,Hermes," Say, I'm no physicist, but I think I know how to stop the skipping. We'll just--
",8210045,Hermes," I don't know how this was suppose to work.
",4410046,Amy," Professor, I hope you find out what's wrong before we skip right past my birth--
",8210047,All," --ppy birthday, Amy.
",2210048,Amy," Hooray! Look at all these presents!
",3710049,Zoidberg," I hope we all have as much tomorrow at my birth--
",5110050,Zoidberg," What?
",710051,Fry," Psst! Leela. I've set up a time-proof shelter in the closet. There's only room for two, and you're the one I wanna share it with.
",13110052,Leela," Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see.
",3510053,Leela," How exactly will this protect us from time jumps?
",5110054,Fry,"  Because when we're together in here, baby, time will stand still.
",6810055,Fry," Ow!
",510056,Zoidberg," Hmm.  Hmm.
",1210057,Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?
",4410058,Zoidberg," Leela, I would be honoured.
",2910059,Leela," --does the worst W.C. Fields imitation I've ever seen. Zoidberg!
",6610060,Zoidberg," Sorry, you must have been boring me.
",3810061,Leela," The thing is, Fry is very sweet, but he's so immature. I love his boyish charm but I hate his childishness.
",10910062,Zoidberg," So he's not perfect. You don't wanna end up old and lonely like Zoidberg!  You were saying?
",9310063,Farnsworth," Ah, there is it. The Tempus Nebula. Take a whiff through the Smellescope.
",7510064,Tate," What's that funky jazz?
",2510065,Farnsworth," The odour of pure time leaking. When my crew removed the Chronitons, it destabilised the nebula, causing time skips throughout the universe.
",14210066,Bender," Ooh! Let Bubblegum tell it.
",2910067,Tate," Pretend these basketballs are time particles, my silver honky. As the nebula bounce-passes them off us ...  ... they cause these dents, or ""time skips"".
",15410068,Bender," You are so smart!
",1910069,Tate," Hold up. What if we were to move this cluster of starts to these algebraic co-ordinates?
",9010070,Farnsworth," Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of the universe.
",8310071,Tate," Yeah. But is it possible? Moving stars would require one bad-ass gravity pump. And we'd need all the money on Earth to--
",12210072,Tate," What the--
",1210073,Farnsworth," Wha?
",610074,Nixon," Here's the funding for your gravity pump. But it damn well better work! We can't spend all of Earth's money every day. Now, how long will it take to build?
",15710075,Tate," It won't be easy, Nixon. A jim-jam this complex might take months or even--
",7710076,Farnsworth," Ah, there we are. One gravity pump.  Powerful enough to move the stars themselves. Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th--
",15010077,Farnsworth,"  Off you go, apparently.
",2610078,Tate,"  Easy, Leela. Just finger-roll that star to the cosmic basket.
",6410079,Leela," Just a few ... more ... hundred ... thousand ... miles. There!
",6410080,Tate,"  Nothing but nebula!
",2210081,Leela," We'll have to run some tests back on Earth, but I think we've stopped the time skips.
",8710082,Bender," Alright!
",1010083,Tate," Jamming!
",1010084,Fry," Hooray for Leela!
",1910085,Bender," And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum the Globetrotter uniform I made myself!
",11510086,Tate," Let me see.  Hello, lawsuit!
",3010087,Fry," Leela, I want you to know I think the way you moved those stars around was really wonderful. I got you something.
",11510088,Leela," Moderately-priced, domestic, non-vintage champagne? How did you know?
",7110089,Fry," You deserve it. I mean, nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are.
",8510090,Leela," Aw! That is so true and sweet.
",3210091,Fry," You're smart, you're beautiful, and best of all, you'll go out with me-e?
",7510092,Leela," Fry, please try to understand: You're a man, I'm a woman. We're just too different.
",8510093,Bender," Hey, Leela. Bubblegum might let me organise a bake sale for the Globetrotter wives. Can you teach me to make cupcakes?
",12010094,Leela," Alright, but I wanna lick the beaters.
",4010095,Fry," I got her champagne, I opened it. What does a guy have to do?
",6310096,Tate," 86 the chump stuff, F-man. It's time to win Leela's heart with a big-showy, three-point romantic gesture.
",10710097,Fry," Hmm. Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise.
",6110098,Leela," Fry, what are you doing?
",2610099,Tate," Uh-oh. Time to boogie on down to the sauna!
",4510100,Fry," Look. I've been studying how to pilot the ship. Impressed?
",6010101,Leela," Yeah, actually. You're doing OK. The core reactor temperature's nominal, the blinker's off.
",9310102,Fry," I learned how to work the gravity pump too. In case we need to move more stars. So, are we dating now?
",10410103,Leela," Is that what this is all about? Please, just cut it out now.
",6210104,Fry," Look, Leela. I know there's some perfect, amazing thing I can do to make you love me, and when I figure out what it is--
",12210105,Leela," Fry, stop. I don't wanna hurt you, but there is absolutely, positively no way that you and I will ever, ever--
",11210106,Preacherbot," --man and wife. You may kiss the bride.
",4110107,Albert," Yes!
",610108,Zoidberg," He looks radiant!
",1910109,Farnsworth," Ye Gods, Bubblegum! We failed. The time skips haven't stopped at all.
",7110110,Tate," Even in these formal shorts, I feel like a failure.
",5310111,Leela," You tricked me into marrying you, didn't you?
",4710112,Fry," Of course not.
",1610113,Leela," How'd you do it? Drugs in the champagne? Hypnosis?
",5210114,Fry," No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big, weird eyebrows. I don't know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but, whatever it was, we're married now. We've got the rest of our lives to work--
",22110115,Whitey," Divorce is final.
",1910116,Fry," What?
",710117,Leela," Well, let's divide up the china. I guess I'll take the NFC helmets and you can have the AFC helmets.
",10210118,Fry," Fine. Break my heart again.
",2910119,Zoidberg," Don't be so hard on yourself, Fry. You lost the woman of your dreams but you still have Zoidberg. You all still have Zoidberg.
",12810120,Fry," How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure it out.
",7710121,Hermes," Maybe you're just a fantastic lover, Fry.
",4310122,Amy," Um, no.
",910123,Fry," I don't know what I'm doing.
",3010124,Bender," Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What do you say, Bubblegum?
",10610125,Tate," Hell, no.
",1110126,Fry," Oh, it's hopeless. I did something so great that it won Leela's heart and I'll never, ever know what it was. My life is empty.
",12810127,Zoidberg,"  Zoidberg!
",1210128,Farnsworth," No wonder we failed to stop the time skips. Diverting Chronitons is mathematically impossible. I knew I should have checked your show-boating Globetrotter algebra.
",16510129,Tate," Man, I thought you knew that algebra was all razz-ma-tazz. A Globetrotter always saves the good algebra for the final minutes.
",12810130,Bender," Vintage Bubblegum!
",2010131,Farnsworth," The time skips are worse than ever now. Isolated spots are jumping by years at a time. Look.
",9410132,Boy," Stupid senior citizens. Why should we have to pay for their social security benefits?
",8710133,Old Man #1," I deserve free money!
",2310134,Farnsworth," Well, I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the finest scientific minds in the univ--
",8410135,Farnsworth," Perhaps we could explode the whole damned nebula. What do you think, Curly Joe?
",8110136,Curly Joe," No, man. An explosion big enough to destroy that mama would take out half the universe.
",8910137,Sweet Clyde," You gotta Globetrotter that explosion up a little, Farnsy. Make it an implosion.
",8210138,Farnsworth," By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion might just form a black hole that would stop more Chronitons from escaping.
",12010139,Tate," Whoa. Slow that brain train down, Prof. We'd need some kind of doomsday device to initiate an implosion like that.
",11610140,Farnsworth," Doomsday device? Ah! Now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!  I suppose I could part with one and still be feared.
",11410141,Tate," Give me some skin, Prof. I'm making you an honorary Globetrotter. In fact, everybody in this room's an honorary Globetrotter.
",12710142,Amy," Hooray!
",910143,Hermes," Yes!
",610144,Zoidberg," I'm a Globetrotter!
",2110145,Bender,"  Did you just say--
",2110146,Tate," Too late, hot plate.
",2210147,Bender," Oh, crap.
",1110148,Tate," We must leave now, for we are needed elsewhere. But we wish you Godspeed.
",7510149,Bender," Please, please let me come with you. I can make myself taller.
",6410150,Tate," Bender, you can talk trash, you can handle the ball. But look in your heart and ask yourself: Are you funky enough to be a Globetrotter? Are you?
",14710151,Bender," Yes.
",610152,Tate," Are you?
",1010153,Bender," I mean, with time, my funk level could--
",4210154,Tate," Are you?
",1010155,Bender,"  No.
",610156,Tate," Deal with it.
",1510157,Bender," Oh! No!
",910158,Leela,"  Careful with that doomsday device, Bender.
",4510159,Bender," What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, everyone else's, is meaningless.
",11310160,Leela,"  Roger.
",910161,Fry," Leela, about the wedding. I don't know what I did to make you love me, and I don't think I tricked you into it, but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm sorry.
",15510162,Leela," It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always be friends, right?
",5610163,Fry," Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could do will ever make you feel the same way about me that I do about you.
",11210164,Leela," I guess not.
",1410165,Bender," Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little.
",14310166,Leela," OK. Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance.  Actually, I think I'll go down and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm?
",14510167,Fry," She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will.
",12210168,Bender," Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve.
",7710169,Fry," Oh!  That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky.
",10410170,Leela,"  Detonation in three, two, one.
",3310171,Fry,"  No!  Did you see it? Did you see it?
",3910172,Bender," The explosion?
",1610173,Fry," No, not the explosion!
",2410174,Leela," Then what?
",1210175,Fry,"  Nothing.
",1110176,Narrator,"  You're entering a realm which is unusual. Maybe it's magic or contains some kind of monster. The second one. Prepare to enter ... The Scary Door.  Please send a man round back and pick up Clyde Smith, a professional gambler who's about to have an unfortunate accident.
",27110177,Smith,"  A casino where I'm winning? That car musta killed me. I must be in heaven!  A casino where I always win? That's boring. I must really be ... in hell!
",15210178,Sebastian Cabot,"  No, Mr. Smith. You're not in heaven or hell. You're on an aeroplane.
",7110179,Smith,"  There's a gremlin destroying the plane! You've gotta believe me!
",6710180,Sebastian Cabot,"  Why should I believe you? You're Hitler!
",4310181,Smith,"  No!  Eva Braun! Help me!
",2710182,Bender," Saw it comin'!
",1610183,Fry," I just saw something incredibly cool: A big, floating ball that lit up with every colour in the rainbow, plus some new ones that were so beautiful I fell to my knees and cried.
",17810184,Amy," Was it out in front of Discount Shoe Outlet?
",4610185,Fry," Yeah.
",710186,Amy," They have a college kid wear that to attract customers.
",5710187,Fry," Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment I felt the heartbeat of creation, and it was one with my own.
",13610188,Amy," Big deal!
",1110189,Bender," We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about it.
",7610190,Fry," How can you people be so blasÃ©? Here you are in the year 3000 or so, yet you just sit around like it's the boring time I came from.
",13310191,Farnsworth," Boring? Wasn't that the period when they cracked the human genome and boy bands roamed the Earth?
",9910192,Fry," Yeah. But now it's the distant future. Why aren't we out doing everything I ever dreamed of?
",9410193,Leela," Hey, you know what might be a hoot?
",3710194,Farnsworth," No. Why would I know that?
",2810195,Leela," Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything he ever wanted to do.
",9210196,Fry,"  Everything?
",1410197,Leela," Except that.
",1410198,Sal," Sos your fantasies has always been to destroys a planet, huh?
",6310199,Fry," Yeah, what did they ever do for me?
",3710200,Leela," Wow! The most humdrum activities look almost exciting through your eyes. What should we do next?
",9810201,Fry," I wanna see the edge of the universe!
",3910202,Amy," Ooh! That sounds cool.
",2410203,Zoidberg," It's funny. You live in the universe, but you never do these things till someone comes to visit.
",9810204,Farnsworth,"  There it is! The edge of the universe!
",4110205,Fry," Far out! So there's an infinite number of parallel universes?
",6310206,Farnsworth," No, just the two.
",1910207,Fry," Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough.
",3510208,Bender," I'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy hat over me! Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy.
",9810209,Fry,"  Yee-haw! Bow before your master, puny mortals!  Giddy-up!
",6010210,Girl," Mommy, why is that man like that?
",3510211,Mother," Don't look at him!
",2010212,Fry," That was fun. Let's give him a treat!
",3910213,Leela," Keep your palms flat.
",2310214,Fry," The tongue tickles.
",2110215,Fry," These new hands are great. I'm gonna break 'em in tonight.
",6010216,Farnsworth," Yes, it's been quite an hour and a half.
",4210217,Fry," I've only got two fantasies left: Be invisible in a chocolate factory and be romantically linked with a celebrity.
",11610218,Bender," I could pound your head till you think that's what happened.
",6210219,Fry," OK.
",510220,Leela," Wait, hold on. It is actually possible to meet any celebrity you want.
",7210221,Fry," It is?
",810222,Leela," Of course! You should read a blimp sometime.
",4610223,Fry,"  Download a celebrity from the Internet? What part of that do I understand?
",7710224,Leela," It's simple. You can download a celebrity's personality and appearance into a blank robot.
",9210225,Fry," Hey, I have an idea. Let's do that!
",3710226,Farnsworth," Onto the Internet you go!
",2710227,Bender," Oh, and while you're there, pick me up a few credit card numbers.
",6710228,Trekkie #1," No way! Kirk could kick Picard's ass!
",3910229,Trekkie #2," Yeah? At least Picard had the guts to admit he was bald!
",5810230,Trekkie #1," What? You take that back!
",2710231,Fry," Ooh! eBay!
",1210232,Auctioneer," Are there no further bids for this exquisite galaxy?  Sold to The Being of Inconceivable Horror.
",9810233,The Being of Inconceivable Horror," Will a money order be OK?
",2710234,Auctioneer," Yes.
",610235,Fry," So where's the celebrity dating place?
",4010236,Leela," Let's search the web.  Over there.
",3610237,Salesman #1," Welcome to Nappster. Let's see what celebrities we've got in stock.  Can I interest you in Gwyneth Paltrow?
",10910238,Fry," Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks human blood.
",5410239,Salesman #1," Then, uh, how about Cleopatra, whose beauty destroyed mighty empires.
",7110240,Fry," I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved underarms. Do you have anything with more of a Lucy-Liu-feel to it?
",11110241,Salesman #1," Nah, nothing like that. Though we do have Lucy Liu.  Only woman ever to be named People magazine's sexiest woman of the year twice. In 2003, and then again in 2063.
",16610242,Fry," I'd like the 2003 model.
",2610243,Fry," I've found her! What do I do now?
",3510244,Farnsworth," Download her. Let's just put a blank robot in the drive.
",5810245,Fry," It worked!
",1210246,Liubot," You're one sexy man,  Philip J. Fry.
",3810247,Fry,"  It worked perfectly!
",2310248,Leela," Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu. Are you just going to stare vacantly at her and not say anything?
",9810249,Liubot," I find your slack-jawed stare very attractive,  Philip J. Fry.
",6410250,Fry," Did you hear that? She likes me!
",3410251,Farnsworth," Well, duh! She's programmed to like you!
",4210252,Fry," But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only good actress of the 21st century! She's more than just a piece of software.
",11610253,Liubot," Would you like to take a moment to register me?
",4910254,Fry," Uh, not right now.
",2010255,Liubot," I'll remind you later, you hot stud, you!
",4310256,Fry," So, uh, what do you feel like doing?
",3810257,Liubot," Would you like to take a moment to register me?
",4910258,Fry," I said later!
",1510259,Fry," Then when I feel so stuffed I can't eat anymore, I just use the restroom, and then I can eat more.
",10010260,Liubot," You should write a book, Fry. People need to know about the  can eat more.
",7610261,Fry," Oh, Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies.
",7210262,Liubot," My personality is mathematically derived from my movies, proportionally weighted by box office receipts.
",10610263,Fry," You're cute!
",1410264,Liubot," You're cute!
",1410265,Fry," You!
",610266,Liubot," You!
",610267,Fry," You!
",610268,Liubot," You!
",610269,Fry," You!
",610270,Farnsworth," Oh, dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop and he's an idiot. Well, that's love for you.
",8910271,Bender," Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
",12910272,Leela," Bender, this is Fry's decision ... and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.
",10410273,Leela," She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that--
",6910274,Bender,"  Stay away from our women! You got metal fever, boy! Metal fever!
",6710275,Fry," Well, so what if I love a robot? It's not hurting anybody.
",6010276,Hermes," My God! He never took middle school hygiene. He never saw the propaganda film.
",8010277,Farnsworth," It's just lucky I keep a copy in the VCR at all times.
",5610278,Narrator,"  Ordinary human dating. It's enjoyable and it serves an important purpose.  But when a human dates an artificial mate, there is no purpose. Only enjoyment. And that leads to ... tragedy.
",18810279,Billy,"  Neat-o! A Marilyn Monroe-bot!
",3210280,Monroe-bot,"  Ooh! You're a real dreamboat,  Billy Everyteen.
",5010281,Narrator,"  Harmless fun? Let's see what happens next.
",4510282,Billys Mom,"  Billy, do you want to walk your dog?
",3910283,Billy,"  No thanks, Mom. I'd rather make out with my Monroe-bot.
",5810284,Billys Dad,"  Billy, do want to get a paper route and earn some extra cash?
",6410285,Billy,"  No thanks, Dad. I'd rather make out with my Monroe-bot.
",5810286,Mavis,"  Billy, do you want to come over tonight? We can make out together.
",6910287,Billy,"  Gee, Mavis, your house is across the street. That's an awfully long way to go for making out.
",9610288,Narrator,"  Did you notice what went wrong in that scene? Ordinarily, Billy would work hard to make money from his paper route. Then he'd use the money to buy dinner for Mavis, thus earning the slim chance to perform the reproductive act. But in a world where teens can date robots, why should he bother? Why should anyone bother? Let's take a look at Billy's planet a year later.  Where are all the football stars?  And where are the biochemists?  They're trapped! Trapped in a soft, vice-like grip of robot lips. All civilisation was just an effort to impress the opposite sex ... and sometimes the same sex. Now, let's skip forward 80 years into the future. Where is Billy?
",66710289,Billy,"  Farewell!
",1210290,Narrator,"  The next day, Billy's planet was destroyed by aliens.  Have you guessed the name of Billy's planet? It was Earth. Don't date robots!
",13510291,Announcer #1,"  Brought to you by the Space Pope.
",3610292,Leela," Did that make any impression on you, Fry? Fry?
",4810293,Liubot," Ooh!
",610294,Farnsworth," I knew I should have shown him Electro Gonorrhoea: The Noisy Killer.
",7010295,Bender," What is the world coming to? That Fry's a sicko poivert, I tell you. Dating a robot! It's an atrosmacy!
",10510296,Leela," But Fry's our friend, Bender.
",3110297,Bender," Aw, jeez, would you stifle there, meatbag?
",4410298,Leela," You stifle, Bender.
",2110299,Zoidberg," Hooray! Finally you're standing up to him.
",4410300,Leela," Although he is completely right.
",3410301,Bender," We've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay. It's time to shut down nappster.com!
",8810302,Bender," Who's in charge of this dump?
",3110303,Jeff Jervis,"  That'd be me. If you're an investor you can dump your money in the hole there.
",8110304,Bender," Listen, you fat Internet nerd.
",3210305,Jeff Jervis," Listening.
",1210306,Bender," Your company promotes wrong love! If you don't shut down right now the only thing wired about you will be your jaw!
",11710307,Jeff Jervis," Y-You can't shut us down. The Internet is about the free exchange and sale of other people's ideas. We've done nothing wrong.
",12710308,Liu,"  Help! I'm being held prisoner!
",3310309,Zoidberg," Someone in trouble is!
",2410310,Jeff Jervis," No, stay out! There's a ... guy going for the Tetris world record in there!
",7710311,Kidman," Who are you?
",1410312,Cheech," Don't hurt us!
",1610313,Liu," Help me! They've been holding me prisoner for 800 years.
",5810314,Zoidberg," The real Lucy Liu! The one you can see a movie of in the popcorn stadium.
",7510315,Bender," So what's your problem?
",2510316,Liu," Those sweaty nerds are making illegal copies of us.   It hurts!
",6510317,Jeff Jervis,"  Open this door! Don't make me call the maintenance guy.
",5810318,Bender," It's a bluff!
",1510319,Leela," We can't take that chance. Move, people, move!
",4810320,Michael," Please pick me up before you go-go.
",3710321,Leela," She asked first.
",1810322,Nerd #1," Um, are you Lucy Liu?
",2310323,Albright-bot," Sure!
",710324,Jeff Jervis," Oh, we're doomed. They got the head, they uncovered the sign! Soon the whole world will learn we're cyber-criminals. And we would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling adults.
",19710325,Man #1," We'll stop them. They like Lucy Liu, we'll give them all the Lucy Liu they can handle! Hand me that back-up disk.
",11510326,Zoidberg," Did you see me escaping? I was all like--
",4310327,Liu," Thanks for rescuing me. Especially you, Bender.  Mmm. Quite a masculine piece of metal, aren't you?
",10110328,Bender," Hey! Don't look at me like that. If you're thinking of crossing the line with Bender, you can forget it. Bender don't bend that way.
",13410329,Leela," Hey, look. It's another Lucy Liubot.
",3810330,Liubot #2,"  I am Lucy Liu. Give me your spines.
",3810331,Zoidberg," Hey, what the--
",1710332,Liubot #2,"  Take this and that and one of these.
",3910333,Liu," Hey! Cut it out! I don't need this kind of publicity!
",5510334,Leela," Alright, Liu. Time to kick your frosty, well-toned ass! Yah!
",6210335,Bender," Then along came Bender.
",2510336,Zoidberg," Looks like you're retaining water.
",3610337,Liu," That was incredible, Bender. You're like Jackie Chan before he got all doughy.
",8010338,Bender," Oh, shucks! I wasn't afraid of that robot. I'm pretty brave once you get past my macho exterior!  It's an army of Lucy Lius!
",12610339,Liu," They're horrible!
",1910340,Liubots,"  Take this and that and one of these.
",3910341,Liubot #3,"  Robot crouching tiger.
",2510342,Liubot #4,"  Robot crane style!
",2110343,Zapp," Now that's a wave of destruction that's easy on the eyes!
",5910344,Liubot #5,"  Hi-yah.
",1010345,Fry," This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has a vampire and an explosion!
",7510346,Liubot," It's amazing the way you  notice two things.
",4610347,Alex,"  No, don't open that coffin! It's ticking!
",4410348,Natalie,"  I have to, Alex. That coffin's not going to open itself.
",5910349,Vampire,"  Bleurh!
",1010350,Liu," Let's hide in here. It'll add to my box office gross.
",5510351,Leela," Fry?
",610352,Fry," Aw, you guys came to watch me make out! That is so sweet.  Wait a minute! Is that the head of who I think it's of?
",11610353,Liu," Read the jar, Evelyn Wood! Dr. Z?
",3510354,Leela," Fry, a herd of Lucy Liu are destroying the city. Is yours acting normally?
",7610355,Fry," Let me see.  Yep. Why do you ask?
",3510356,Alex,"  Mr. Mayor, if you want to see a real vampire, look in the mirror!
",6810357,Mayor,"  I can't! I'm a vampire!
",2610358,Zoidberg," Why?
",610359,Leela," And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody.
",5410360,Fry,"  Quick! This way!
",1910361,Fry," Sorry, ladies. Employees only.
",3210362,Leela," Oh, no. They're forming a human pyramid ... of robots.
",5610363,Bender," Damnit! We weren't counting on them being as smart as they are sexy!
",7010364,Liu," A dangerous mistake to make.
",3010365,Zoidberg," At least we've got food.
",2610366,Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, cut open that bag!
",3410367,Zoidberg," Hooray!
",910368,Leela," And don't eat it.
",1910369,Liubot #2,"  Ow!
",610370,Liubot #3,"  System overload!
",1910371,Liubot #4,"  Error!
",910372,Liubot #5,"  Does not compute.
",2010373,Zoidberg," Life was bad but now it's good forever!
",4110374,Bender," You'll be safe in here, sweetheart.  Get lost, Pavarotti!
",5910375,Fry," Lucy Liubot, if I don't survive the corn, I want you to know that I love you as much as a man can love a computerised image of gorgeous celebrity. Which it turns out is a lot.
",17710376,Liubot," Oh, Fry, I love you more than the moon and the stars and the  poetic image number 37 not found.
",9710377,Fry," What are you doing, darling? Get down!
",4010378,Liubot #3,"  Light hot. Oil temperature rising.
",3710379,Liubot #4,"  Oh, no.
",1010380,Liubot #5,"  Malfunction.
",1510381,Liubot #6,"  This ain't good.
",1910382,Liubot #7,"  System error.
",1610383,Fry," You saved us. Are you alright?
",3210384,Liubot," Yes, my love. I'll be just  massive corn clog in port seven.
",6210385,Liu," Are you the last copy of me?
",3010386,Liubot," Yes.
",610387,Liu," Erase her, Fry.
",1710388,Fry," What? No!
",1110389,Liu," Fry, when you downloaded her without my permission, you stole my image, and in the end that's all I really have. That and the largest gold nugget in the world, one mile in diameter.
",18310390,Fry," But I just downloaded her because I love you.
",4710391,Liu," If you love the real Lucy Liu and not just what you've seen in movies, genre-straddling lawyer shows and kiss-ass articles in People magazine, you'll blank out that robot.
",17310392,Fry," I'm sorry. Hug me, Liubot.
",2810393,Liubot," I'll always remember you, Fry--  Memory deleted.
",5010394,Bender," I know it hurts, buddy. But at least you're not in a sick relationship with a robot anymore.
",9410395,Fry," Uh-huh. And I guess now maybe I can get to know the real Lucy Liu.
",6810396,Bender," Pft! Yeah, at our wedding!
",2810397,Liu," It's true. Bender and I are in love.
",3810398,Fry," But, but--
",1210399,Bender," Don't be a prude, Fry!
",2410400,Leela," Oh, put down the binoculars, Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse twice in one day.
",10510401,Fry," I know, and I've grown to accept that. Now I'm more interested in that new pizza parlour across the street. Kinda makes me pine for my days as a pizza delivery boy. ""Here's you pizza,"" I'd say. ""I didn't order any,"" they'd say. And then I'd be off to my next adventure.
",27110402,Leela," That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars.  I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.
",8010403,Farnsworth," Cygnoids? On our block? Flying foo! They should go back where they came from.
",7910404,Leela," Professor, please! Society's never gonna make any progress until we all learn to pretend to like each other. Now let's go over there and make these hideous strangers feel welcome.
",18110405,Farnsworth," No!
",510406,Blek," You sure about these chairs? Guidebook says human legs bend down at knee.
",7510407,Blek," It's OK, Mama. Anyone complains, I bend legs up for free.  Ooh! Customers!  Welcome to Earth pizza store. Here, sit. I bend knees for you.
",14010408,Bender," Ooh! That's a-comfy!
",2210409,Blek," OK, now, what kind of pizza goes in you?  Silt? Asbestos? We got guano -- very fresh!
",8710410,Fry," Uh ... hmm ... do you have any food?
",3810411,Blek," Here, try a deep dish pizza.  Contains four kind of things.
",6110412,Leela," I don't mean to offend, but this tastes like vomit.
",5310413,Cygnoid Woman #1,"  Thank you.
",1310414,Leela," No, actually, I did mean to offend a little. This is awful.
",6110415,Fry," Hey, hey. What's wrong? Was it something Leela said?
",5410416,Cygnoid Woman #1,"  We come to Earth to start new life. Raise fat spoiled Earth kids, hang many underwear from Earth clothesline, live Earthican dream.
",13410417,Fry," Aw. Don't cry, foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza, Earth style!
",16410418,Cygnoid Woman #1," Oh, thank you, magic biped!
",2910419,Blek," You save us, a-sir. If we cannot make Earth pizza our dream will die. Just like rats we crushed to make the wine.
",11510420,Fry," For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point: No more live bees.  Oregano works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven, don't get in with them.
",16910421,Cygnoid #2," Hey, ocupado!
",1510422,Fry," Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV when they're eating so they don't have to talk to each other.  Ah, the Earthican pastime: Blernsball!
",17210423,Uecker,"  Mulligan drives the ball. It's going, going and caught by the shortstop. Mets lose again. Man, I haven't seen play this bad since the days of Bob Uecker! This is Bob Uecker saying thanks for watching!
",20310424,Blek," Mets? Shortstop? Pinching the hitter? I don't understand this ""blernsball"".
",7710425,Fry," Well, if you're going to be Earthicans, we'll have to teach you. How about your pizzeria plays a game against Planet Express? Oh, but you'll need nine players.
",16110426,Cygnoid Woman #1," No problem!
",1310427,Cygnoid #2," Play the ball!
",1610428,Farnsworth,"  Go, team! Beat those no good Cygnoids! Show them they stink at a game they've never played before!
",10110429,Blek," Ah, this is why I love Earth! Beautiful star-brightened day, friendly blernsball game with chum pals! So pleasant for everybody.
",13010430,Scruffy," Hit by a pitch. Take your base.
",3310431,Leela,"  Sorry about that. I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches.
",6510432,Bender," No batter! No batter!  No batter anymore.
",4310433,Scruffy," Take your base.
",1710434,Leela,"  I didn't mean to hit you. I have some trouble with depth perception.
",7110435,Cygnoid #2," Yeah, me too now.
",1910436,Bender," Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter!  Duck!
",8710437,Scruffy," Take your base.
",1710438,Cygnoid #3," Please, lady, I want to live. Can I use bat to protect head?
",6210439,Bender," Apparently not.
",1710440,Man #1," Check out the one-eyed bean machine!
",3810441,Blek," Hooray! I make a score point!
",3110442,Fry," Leela, you beaned a run-in. You'd better let me pitch.
",5610443,Leela," But I've got a no-hitter going.  You're right. Here.
",5410444,Randy," Don't take her out, she's a firecracker!
",4210445,Doubledeal," Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you.
",3710446,Leela," Am I under arrest?
",2010447,Bender," Wait! I know you. You're the sleazebag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
",8510448,Doubledeal," Not anymore. Now I'm the sleazebag who owns the New New York Mets.
",6810449,Leela," The Mets? Those bums are worse than me.
",4110450,Doubledeal," Close to it. But they don't draw a crowd like you. Which is why I wanna sign you to the team.
",9510451,Leela," You mean I'd be the first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball?
",7110452,Commissioner," Well, yeah, but basically you'd just be a publicity stunt. I figure a one-eyed lady skull-buster might bring out the freakshow crowd.
",13510453,Leela," Wow! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball.
",6010454,Commissioner," Again, yeah, but basically you'd just be--
",4410455,Leela," Ta-da! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball. How do I look?
",7710456,Hermes," Like a sexy Yogi Berra!
",2510457,Farnsworth," Why is your number seven-eighth's?
",3610458,Leela," All the whole numbers have been retired.
",4210459,Fry," Wow! I must say, I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on the butt?
",9410460,Leela," Fry, I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead.
",4710461,Fry," Oh! Now I'm too nervous.
",2610462,Uecker," Well, folks, it's only the fifth inning but the Swedes have already turned this one into a ""laffer"". And that's with two F's. The crowd is pouring out of the stadium L.A.-style.
",17910463,Doubledeal," Skipper, we're losing the crowd. Put it our new novelty act: Leela.
",6910464,Skipper," Darn it! I already put in the circus clown.
",4510465,Doubledeal," Yeah, but he bunted. Clowns are only funny when they swing away.
",6610466,Announcer #1,"  Your attention, please. Now pitching for the Mets: Turanga Leela.  A one-eyed woman.
",8710467,Woman #1," Come on! Throw like a girl!
",2910468,Fry,"  Go, Leela!
",1310469,Bender,"  Come on, girl!
",1710470,Amy,"  Too much eyeliner!
",2110471,Uecker," This is history in the making, folks. Bjornson steps up to the plate and Leela delivers.
",9010472,Bender," Bullseye!
",1110473,Uecker," Ooh! An inauspicious start for the career of the first woman blernsballer.  An inauspicious continuation for the career of the first woman blernsballer.
",15410474,Crowd,"  Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean!
",6210475,Uecker," Ouch! It's a three-bean-ball salad. The Mets fans love it though, and who can blame them? They haven't had much to cheer about this year--
",14010476,Doubledeal," Kid, that was great! You got us more publicity than a cowboy in a shark tank. Poor Tex, he was quite a shark.
",11110477,Man #1," Hey!
",610478,Man #1 #2," Hey!
",610479,Man #1 #3," Come on!
",1010480,Man #1 #4," I win!
",810481,Bender," Oop! Sorry.
",1310482,Leela," Bender, how did you get in here?
",3410483,Bender,"  As your agent, I have access to you at all times.
",5210484,Leela," Since when are you my agent?
",3010485,Bender," Quiet, call coming in.  Yes? A big endorsement deal for Leela? How much? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!
",14310486,Leela," Bender, that's great! How much did you get me?
",4810487,Bender,"  One hundred dollars.
",2310488,Leela,"  As a pitcher, I serve up plenty of bean balls. So I know good beans when I see them. Bean-Bay Beans: They're the beaniest!
",12510489,Director #1 #1," Cut!
",610490,Uecker," In very short order, Leela has become a fan favourite.
",5610491,Bender," You're the best, babe!  Hang on. Call comin' in.  What's that? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!
",13310492,Leela," So what did you get me?
",2510493,Bender,"  A thousand and one pesos!
",2810494,Leela," Yo soy muy malo en lanzar, pero yo soy muy bueno en comer frijoles. Come los Bean Bay frijoles, los frijoles de los reyes.
",12410495,Director #1 #2," Cut! OK, now do one with bean suit on!
",4010496,Blek," Leela really bringing in the customers.
",4110497,Cygnoid Woman #1," This keep up, we need to buy second sauce toilet.
",5110498,Girl," When I grow up I want to injure men by throwing stuff at them just like you, Leela. Will you sign my magazine?
",11210499,Leela," Aw! Sure thing, sweetie. Who should I make it out to?
",5510500,Girl," Well, uh ... to eBay?
",2310501,Leela," That's a popular name today. Little ""e"" big ""B""?
",5010502,Bender," Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add a one and two zeros in front of that and we got ourselves a wad!
",10510503,Leela," I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm doing it for all the struggling female athletes who need a role model.
",10810504,Woman #1," Yeah! A role model for how to stink!
",3810505,Leela," What? Who are you?
",2010506,Woman #1," Jackie Anderson. I'm on the blernsball team at NNYU and I was hoping to get to play in the majors soon.
",10510507,Leela," Oh, following in my footsteps?
",3210508,Jackie," Pft. God forbid! Your little freakshow is making it impossible for real female ball players to be taken seriously. I hope you're proud of yourself.
",14910509,Bender," Alright, show's over. No refunds. You heard the robot. Get out!
",6510510,Leela," I'm a fool. The fans haven't been cheering for me, they've been cheering at me.
",8110511,Amy," Don't be upset, Leela. You, um ... you look really cute in your uniform.
",7410512,Leela,"  That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic.
",7110513,Bender," You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You know the one I mean? The one who died?
",11010514,Leela," You're right. I can't let people down anymore. As God as my witness, I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere. I will become the best blernsball player of all time.
",18110515,Hermes," That's statistically impossible. In 77 innings you haven't gotten a single out. At this rate, you're sure to go down as the worst blernsball player of all time.
",16210516,Leela," Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear that I will become not the worst blernsball player of all time.
",10910517,Fry," Hey, look! The players who broke the various colour barriers.
",6310518,Bender," When will Man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?
",6810519,Leela," Ah, here we are. The worst player in history. If I can be just a little better than him I can slink away with my head held high.
",13010520,Bender," It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat.
",8010521,Fry," And here he is trying to make a catch with an oven mitt.
",5810522,Leela," It's even a crummy hologram.
",3010523,Aaron Jr.," I'm not a hologram, though I am crummy.  Hank Aaron XXIV.
",5910524,Fry," Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!
",8610525,Aaron Sr.," No, I was better than great. I was the home run king!
",5510526,Bender," Neat!
",710527,Leela," So, Hank-- The bad Hank. Just how blowful were you?
",5310528,Aaron Jr.," Well, I had a low batting average.
",3610529,Aaron Sr.," Low? It was zero, you fungo! You went your whole career without getting a hit.
",8010530,Fry," Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting an out.
",7910531,Aaron Sr.," You stink, lady! Hey, Junior, she belongs in the exhibit instead of you.
",7410532,Aaron Jr.," Forget it. This job's too cushy to give up.  Ah, Wade Boggs! Goes down smooth!
",8010533,Leela," Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. That's why I need your help. So I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you.
",12010534,Aaron Jr.," Oh, I can't help you play better than Tiny Iota. That guy was great. But I'll teach you everything I know.
",10810535,Aaron Jr.," OK, let's see what you can do.
",3210536,Bender," One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better get a batting helmet.
",10610537,Leela,"  Alright. Low and away.
",2510538,Aaron Jr.," OK, try it again. But this time keep your eye off the ball.
",6110539,Leela," You mean ""keep your eye on the ball""?
",3910540,Aaron Jr.," Hey, lady, which one of us is in the hall of fame?
",5210541,Fry,"  Pst. You're holding the bat upside down.
",4310542,Aaron Jr.," Just pitch the ball.
",2210543,Leela," OK. Eye off the ball.
",2310544,Bender," Strike!
",910545,Fry," Hooray!
",910546,Aaron Jr.," You did it, Leela!
",2010547,Leela," I didn't hit the batter! For once I was pitching and not just belly-itching!
",7810548,Aaron Jr.," Oh, you got that too? I think there's a rash goin' around.
",6010549,Uecker," Welcome to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Poindexters, where the Mets close out a season that'll rank among Mankind's most awful crimes.
",13910550,Fry," Hey! You opened a franchise!
",3010551,Cygnoid Woman #1," Yes. Our biggest seller is Leela's Bean Pizza. Six kinds of beans, plus several things that look like beans.
",11010552,Gilman," Beans, huh? Mmm. This is great! How to you make the crust so fizzy?
",6910553,Blek," Ah-ah-ah! Ancient Cygnoid secret!
",3510554,Cygnoid Woman #1," My husband, some hotshot! Here's his ancient Cygnoid secret!  Live hornets! We smush them right into dough!
",10910555,Gilman," I don't care if there's horse manure in it!
",4510556,Blek," That's a-good!
",1610557,Gilman," I wanna buy this franchise. How does $100,000 sound?
",5410558,Blek," Forget it! We come to Earth to make pizza, not money.
",5510559,Cygnoid Woman #1," No, Blek! Other way around!
",2910560,Blek," Oh, right. Offer accepted!
",2810561,Uecker," Well, fans, Boston's turning the last game into a real ""squeeeker""! And that's with three ""e's""! Two men on and they're down to their last out.
",14510562,Leela," Come on, skipper. It's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player ever. Please put me in.
",9710563,Skipper," No. We're actually winning this game. You only go in as a joke when we're eight runs behind. Or when our other pitchers sneak out early to beat the traffic.   Come on! Let's see some fundamentals out there!  And not clown fundamentals.  Aw, darn, darn darn! Now the bases are loaded! Isn't there a man on this team who can get one more out?
",34210564,Leela," I can.
",810565,Skipper," I repeat: Isn't there a man on this team on this--
",5210566,Leela," I've been training with Hank Aaron.
",3710567,Skipper," You've been training with the Hank Aaron?
",4310568,Leela," I've been training with a Hank Aaron.
",3910569,Skipper," Alright then. Get in there and pitch like you've never pitched like you before!
",8110570,Announcer #1,"  Now pitching for the Mets: Turanga Leela.
",4410571,Crowd,"  Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean!  Go, Leela!
",4410572,Farnsworth,"  Go, Leela!
",1310573,Amy,"  Come on, Leela!
",1810574,Bender,"  Put it right down the pike!
",3010575,Fry,"  Strike him out, Leela! Do it for the hundreds of women everywhere!
",6910576,Announcer #1,"  Your attention: Now pinch-hitting for the Poindexters: Jackie Anderson.
",7410577,Uecker," Would you look at that! College blernsball's finest female hitter making her big league debut against pro-ball's worst female anything. I've never seen anything this bizarre, and I've seen Mr. Belvedere naked! Woo!
",21610578,Leela,"  Keep cool. She's just like any other player. She puts on her sports bra one arm at a time.
",9310579,Umpire," Strike one!
",1310580,Leela," Strike one, a personal best!
",3010581,Umpire," Strike two!
",1310582,Uecker,"  Remember, fans, this exciting moment is brought to you by Month Old Franks, the hotdogs with experience! Mmm-mmm!  A grand slam blern. The Mets lose! Their season is over! And no question, Leela, the first woman ever to reach the Majors, will go down as the single worst player in the history of blernsball!  And yet tonight we have witnessed the beginning of a great career for the first woman to play the sport well -- Jackie Anderson!
",44010583,Jackie," Leela?
",810584,Leela," Jackie. I guess you were right. I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry.
",6810585,Jackie," No, don't be. It turns out you were an inspiration after all.
",6310586,Leela,"  I was?
",910587,Jackie," Uh-huh. You were so awful that women everywhere set out to prove they don't stink as bad as you. You know, like a pig or something.
",13310588,Leela," Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference after all.
",6710589,Jackie," You absolutely did, Leela. Now please, please retire. Immediately.
",6810590,Leela," Hey, kid. Catch!
",1810591,Aaron Sr.," Well, at least you're still the worst football player of all time.
",6810592,Aaron Jr.," Yeah. Yeah.
",1310593,Linda,"  Up next, daring daylight robbery at a municipal swimming pool.
",6510594,Bender," Ooh! This is it! Turn me up!
",3010595,Linda,"  Earlier today, a foul-mouthed bandit robbed the municipal pool, making off with the contents of over three lockers.
",11810596,Bender," More like three lockers and a sink!
",3710597,Leela," Bender? Did you have something to do with this?
",4910598,Bender," Of course not.
",1610599,Hermes," Holy spitz! He's sportin' skintight Speedos!
",4610600,Amy," They don't leave much to the imagination.
",4310601,Hermes," Actually, on a robot, they sorta do.
",3810602,Morbo,"  One puny human got a look at the robber...
",4510603,Bender," Here we go. Here we go!
",2510604,Morbo,"  Describing him as a short, nasty, muscular...
",4810605,Bender," Yeah, make me famous, big head!
",3310606,Morbo,"  Caucasian human male.
",2410607,Bender," What?
",710608,Fry," Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch and drink all day?
",5710609,Bender," This is an outrage. What's the point of pulling the biggest pool caper ever if nobody knows you did it?
",10510610,Fry," Well, there's the material rewards.
",3710611,Bender," You mean this junk? 
",2210612,Boy," Whee!
",710613,Bender,"  All I ever wanted was for people to remember my name.  It's Bender.
",7010614,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff! Why bother remembering anything? You're just going to forget it five seconds later.
",9510615,Bender,"  It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty in-your-face outlook doomed to obscurity like the rest of you, especially Leela. If I died tomorrow, no one would even notice.
",17510616,Scruffy," Boy, I've never seen him so down, or ever before.
",5110617,Bender," How does a nobody like me get famous?  I know!  Hey, look! I'm stuck! But I haven't given up hope! Call a soft-news journalist!
",12910618,Woman #1," You're not stuck.
",1910619,Bender,"  Shut up.
",1110620,Bender," Hey, everyone do The Bender! This move's called The Bender!
",6110621,Roller-Skater," Yo, hotwheels. This circle's about free expression, not fascist moves!
",7210622,Bender," A blank wall! Fame is mine!
",2910623,Bender," There. Now no one will forget how I lived or my attitude regarding butt.
",7410624,Sal," Alrights, ladies, let's flush these artists lofts straights to hell!
",7010625,Bender,"  No!
",610626,Bender," I'm the first one to work. A new low.
",3910627,All," Surprise!
",1110628,Fry," Happy funeral, Bender!
",2410629,Bender," A surprise funeral? For me?
",2910630,Fry," We just wanted to show you that you really will be remembered.
",6410631,Zoidberg,"  Now if the deceased would kindly take his place of honour.
",6110632,Bender," Ooh! Cushion-y! And a minibar!
",3210633,Fry," Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life when he was crushed by a runaway semi driven by the Incredible Hulk.
",15910634,Bender," Aw! You knew my favourite cause of death.
",4310635,Fry," Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way. Professor?
",8210636,Farnsworth," Your standard bending unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different. Bender had a point-04% nickel impurity.
",12710637,Bender,"  It's what made me me.
",2410638,Hermes," If you ever needed a small package brought into the country without a lot of X-raying and such, Bender always had a free body cavity.
",13510639,Bender," Eh, the Professor's was better.
",3310640,Leela," Bender, shush. You're supposed to be dead.
",4410641,Bender," Say more about how great I am. And where's the crying? You people look like you're waiting for the bus.
",10510642,Zoidberg,"  Oh, Danny-boy,
The pipes, the pipes are calling--
",5210643,Bender," Who-y-boy?
",1210644,Zoidberg,"  From glen to glen and down--
",3110645,Bender," Danny-boy? You're at my funeral, singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy? You really are a massive bonehead.
",11610646,Zoidberg," I'm expressing my sorrow.
",2710647,Bender," Get lost! I'd say ""Don't quit your day job"" but you're awful at that too.
",7510648,Leela," We're trying our best.
",2410649,Bender," Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it up, people. So far it's been crap after crap! I croaked, now show me some love!
",11810650,Amy," Bender was a truly special--
",3010651,Bender,"  Louder and sadder.
",2110652,Amy,"  Bender was a truly special--
",3110653,Bender,"  Next!
",810654,Preacherbot," Dear Lord--
",1310655,Bender,"  Oh, next!
",1210656,Zoidberg,"  Oh, Danny-boy--
",1810657,Bender," Come on! Surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was.
",7110658,Fry," Yes there is, Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people. But, looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this: Bender was my friend.
",17810659,Bender," What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever!  I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living, by showing how bad my funeral will suck.
",20110660,Amy," I know whose funeral we'll be attending next!
",4710661,Farnsworth,"  Oh, stop!
",1210662,Farnsworth," News, everyone! Today you're going to Osiris 4 to deliver this enormous sandstone block.
",9010663,Fry," I thought something looked different in here.
",4710664,Fry," Hi. We have a giant stone to deliver. Sign here.
",5010665,Osiran," Ah, very nice. Much like the 10 million identical stones used in the future tomb of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip.
",11710666,Leela," Impressive. Who's building it?
",3210667,Osiran," You.
",610668,Leela," Say again?
",1210669,Osiran," You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards.
",6310670,Fry," Call it a hunch but I've got a bad feeling about this.
",5610671,Fry," You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but they don't pay you or let you go.
",10410672,Leela," That's the only thing about being a slave!
",4410673,Osiran," Attention. You are now possessions of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip, heir to the Tenth Dynasty, bringer of the good aspects of the annual floods.
",14810674,Fry," Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day.
",6610675,Osiran," That is no coincidence. For our people visited your Egypt thousands of years ago.
",8310676,Fry," I knew it! Insane theories, one; regular theories, a billion.
",6310677,Osiran," We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians, such as pyramid-building, space travel and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello.
",15410678,Fry," Also Wolfman!
",1510679,Bender," Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die.
",6610680,Leela," Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments.
",8910681,Bender," Hey, you spend your whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna remember him.  I think I'm gonna like it here!
",11710682,Man #1," Yeah, I, uh, noticed your sign and I thought I'd come over here and look into getting involved in your program.
",11310683,Man #1 #2," What we do is make you starve to death.
",4110684,Osiran," One, two, three, pull!  One, two, three, pull!
",4810685,Australian Man #1," Oh! Bloody chunder!
",2110686,Bender," Pick it up, people. We're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one-half?
",15810687,Osiran," Good idea, slave.  One-half, pull!  One-half, pull!
",5310688,Bender," Now we're slavin'!
",2010689,Bender," Come on, guys. Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this.  You call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like this.
",17110690,Leela," Bender, quit giving the slave drivers pointers!
",4910691,Fry," Yeah. Remember who your real friends are.
",4310692,Bender," I'll tell you who I remember.  Anopsis ... Pleotut ... Whatshisname. He was the greatest of all.
",9810693,Osiran," Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches.
",3410694,Bender," Hurry! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get that nose in place. Come on!
",6610695,Hermenthotip," Excellent work! I am very proud of all you slaves.
",5210696,Bender," Viva Hermenthotip!
",2010697,Hermenthotip," And now, I have a grand announcement. In honour of your achievement, you're all hereby--
",9010698,Bender,"  No!
",610699,Hermenthotip,"  Tell the slaves they can all go--
",3610700,Bender," Go faster? I told them but they're so damn lazy.
",5010701,Hermenthotip,"  No. I mean they are all free--
",3310702,Bender," Free-loading off you? I agree.
",3210703,Hermenthotip,"  No, I--
",1010704,Osiran," Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead.
",3110705,Bender,"  He's whippin' angels now.
",2810706,High Priest," We commend the body of Hermenthotip to the abode of the damned. The damned good looking!  Pharaoh commanded me to tell that joke at his funeral.
",14610707,Bender,"  I'll always remember you, Hermenthotip!
",4210708,High Priest," To equip Pharaoh for his journey, we bury him with his favourite possessions. Such as his heart and liver.  And the many goods he left in his royal garage.  Also, this bag of cats our culture considers holy.
",20910709,Singer,"  Pharaoh my God-king,
You are cold and deceased,
I used to have him sing...
",7710710,Singer," P-P-P-Pharaoh and his pets...
",3110711,Singer," But the years went by,
And Pharaoh died,
Suzie will have joined him in the afterlife--
",8810712,Osiran," Hermenthotip is gone. The time to designate a new Pharaoh is at hand.
",7110713,Bender," Wow!
",610714,Osiran," At dawn tomorrow, the high priest will consult the Wall of Prophecy to determine Hermenthotip's successor.  That concludes the funeral. You don't have to go home but you can't stay here.
",18810715,Fry," Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!
",3710716,Slave #1," Yes! Tonight we are slaves to no one, except the rhythm!
",5810717,Leela," Yeah! Play those bongos!
",2610718,Fry," I'm gonna spin till I fall down!
",3410719,Bender," We interrupt this ancient prophecy to bring you late-breaking bulletin. He hammers the back of his head and creates and imprint of himself on the wall.
",15310720,High Priest," Great Wall of Prophecy, reveal to us God's will that we may blindly obey.
",7510721,Priests,"  Free us from thought and responsibility.
",4310722,High Priest," We shall read things off you.
",3110723,Priests,"  Then do them.
",1610724,High Priest," Your words guide us.
",2210725,Priests,"  We're dumb.
",1410726,Fry," You know what else stinks about being a slave? The hours.
",5910727,High Priest," The prophecy is strange and crudely drawn at best. It indicates that, we are ""here"" and our next Pharaoh is over there, near some ... tents.
",14210728,Bender,"  Those are waves, jackass. It's supposed to be a river!
",5710729,Fry," Hey. I think I know who the next Pharaoh is!
",4610730,Leela," Oh, Lord!
",1110731,High Priest," We hear your voice, oh, great Pharaoh. Reveal yourself to us.
",6310732,Bender," Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies!
",6210733,High Priest," It is he. Just as the Wall of Prophecy prophesied.  Long live Pharaoh Bender!
",7910734,Slaves,"  Long live Pharaoh Bender!
",2810735,Leela," This society is a bunch of idiots.
",3610736,High Priest," People of Osiris 4, please welcome a man who started as a slave but worked his way up to Lord of All Creation! Our new Pharaoh, Bender!
",13710737,Bender," Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past.  Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.
",13110738,Leela," What did he say?
",1810739,Bender," Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion. One billion cubits in height ...  ... that I might be remember-ed for all eternity. And be quick about it!
",18310740,Bender," Lowly slave, why are you not working?
",3910741,Slave #2," I am.
",710742,Bender," I meant yourself to death.
",2810743,Slave #3," Mighty Pharaoh, it hurts when I breathe.
",4210744,Bender," Well then what do you think you should stop doing?  Crawl, pigs!
",6610745,Leela," Ow!
",510746,Bender," The Pharaoh has spoken.
",2510747,Bender," Your task is nearly completed. Don't let down Pharaoh now.
",6010748,Osiran," The great monument is finished, oh Pharaoh. And now, the unveiling.
",6910749,Statue," Remember me.  Remember me.  Remember me.
",4210750,Osiran," Does it please you, my lord?
",3010751,Bender," Hmm ... it's a good start. Uh, yeah, it's definitely big alright. I just wonder if it's too big, y'know? I mean, are people gonna be remembering me or the statue?
",16410752,High Priest," But, sire, we made it to your exact specifications.
",5310753,Bender," Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down and try again. But this time don't embarrass yourselves.
",9610754,High Priest," Ladies and gentlemen, the Pharaoh suddenly died.
",5010755,Leela," Good riddance.
",1610756,Bender,"  What about my servants?
",2610757,Priest," Oh, yeah.
",1110758,Fry," Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause if it isn't ... we're in trouble!
",7610759,Leela," You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us along?
",4410760,Bender," I wanted to watch you remember me.
",3610761,Leela," Did you really think you'd need all this junk in the afterlife?
",6510762,Bender," Afterlife? Pft. If I thought I had to go through a whole other life I'd kill myself right now.
",9610763,Leela," Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving.
",4310764,Bender," Sorry, but we're totally sealed in.  Nothing can get in or out. Except millions of snakes.  Here, have a pomegranate schnapps from my private distillery and start sharing fond memories of me, Bender.
",20110765,Fry," What proof is this? Some huge number?
",3910766,Leela," It's explosive! Maybe we could escape by setting fire to the distillery and blowing this whole place to rubble!  Let's get a little kindling going!
",14910767,Bender," No! You can't blow up my monument. I won't be remembered.
",5910768,Leela," Oh, right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey, Fry? Remember that robot ""Bender""?
",10110769,Fry," Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell.  Did you hear something, Leela?
",6310770,Leela," No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing.
",5910771,Bender," Stop it, stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line.
",5810772,Fry," Hey, Leela, you know who I remember?
",3810773,Bender," Oh, please, let it be me.
",2710774,Fry," That guy who used to bend things. You know?
",4510775,Bender," Me, please!
",1310776,Fry," Hermes.
",910777,Bender," Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, blow up my statue.
",6810778,Leela," Oh, Bender! When did you come in? Hold still!
",4710779,Leela," Let's blow this tomb!
",2310780,Slave #1," Pharaoh Bender! He once more walks among the living.
",5410781,Bender,"  How we doing?
",1610782,Statue," Remember me.
",1410783,Bender,"  I will. I will.
",1810784,Bender," Please, just leave me alone.
",3010785,Leela," Bender, I understand your desire to be remembered. But you don't need a statue for that.
",9010786,Bender,"  I don't?
",1110787,Leela," No. You have your legacy as a brutal, tyrannical dictator, and that will outlive any monument.
",9610788,Bender," You really think they'll remember me?
",3910789,Fry," Absolutely.
",1310790,Bender," Well in that case. One planet down! Helmsman...
",4910791,Bender,"  Set course for Earth!
",2410792,Leela,"  That's not Earth.
",2010793,Bender,"  Oh.
",610794,Raiders of the Lost Arcade, David X. Cohen,1510795,Farnsworth," There. I've finished fine-tuning my What-If machine. It can answer any ""What-If"" question, accurate to within one-tenth of a plausibility unit.
",14510796,Leela," That's so plausible I can't believe it!
",4110797,Farnsworth," Who wants the machine to show them an alternate reality?
",5810798,Bender," Ooh! Ooh! I wanna know what would happen if I were human. I mean, being a robot's great, but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad.
",15510799,Farnsworth," Oh, Lordy Lou, there he goes again. Well, let's give baby what he wants.  What if Bender were human?
",10210800,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I've invented a way to turn Bender into a human using a process I call ""reverse fossilisation"".
",11810801,Leela," How does it work?
",1910802,Farnsworth," Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realising that, it was a simple matter to reverse the process. I've already tested it by turning the toaster into a racoon.
",19010803,Fry," Kinda game-y.
",1510804,Farnsworth," Are you ready, Bender?
",2410805,Bender," I dunno. I'm beginning to have some second thoughts--
",5510806,Hermes," Cover your shame, mon!
",2410807,Farnsworth," It worked! Eat it, everyone whose never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you, Amy!
",8810808,Bender," So this is a human body, huh? Neat!  Hey, my antenna's gone.  No, it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little.
",16510809,Fry,"  Bender, no! You'll make God cry.
",3510810,Bender," Well, let's see what kinda things this body can do.  Hey, that's pretty fun.  Being human is great!
",10110811,Zoidberg," Hooray! It's just like Mardis Gras!
",3710812,Bender," Guy! Guys! You've gotta see this. You're not gonna believe it!
",6410813,Leela," Bender, it's OK to be proud but don't be a show-off.
",5410814,Bender," Whoa! You look a lot better than you used to for some reason.
",6310815,Amy,"  You're not so bad yourself, big boy.
",3910816,Bender," Hey, that felt great!  Nah, it's not working anymore.
",5510817,Farnsworth," Speak for yourself!
",2110818,Bender," Whoa! This is awesome!
",2410819,Leela," Bender, you drank and smoked when you were a robot.
",5310820,Bender," But now it's bad for me!
",2610821,Fry," Speaking of which, try these nachos.
",3810822,Bender," Mmm! Why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good?  What's going on? That rhythm! It's doing something to my human butt.
",13310823,Amy," Bender, part of being human is having self control.
",5310824,Bender," Oh, my God! I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time!
",7710825,Amy," No, Bender!
",1310826,Hermes," No!
",510827,Leela," Stop him.
",1110828,Bender," Let me go.
",1210829,Leela," No!
",510830,Farnsworth," Come, Bender. It's time to go home and rest. I need you in top shape next week when I present you to the Nobel Prize Committee. Bender?
",13710831,Bender,"  Goodbye, moderation!
",2310832,Zoidberg," Is Bender still missing for a week? Where is he, already?
",5910833,Farnsworth," Uh, as I've said before, I used reverse fossilisation, which is the reverse of regular, um...
",9510834,Fry,"  Pst! We found him!
",2110835,Farnsworth," Ah! Then without further stalling for time, I present to the Nobel judges the first robot ever turned into a human.
",11710836,Wernstrom," My God! He needs medical attention!
",3710837,Zoidberg," Pulse, 300; liver, failing; cholesterol, 40?
",4610838,Leela," Well, that's not so bad.
",2610839,Zoidberg," No, I mean 40 pounds!
",2310840,Farnsworth," This, um, scientific breakthrough ... heralds a new dawn in human-robot relations, yes.
",8910841,Bender," C'mere and give old Bender a kiss.  Hey, you like grilled cheese?
",6710842,Farnsworth," And, um, that's why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize.
",5810843,Wernstrom," Not only do you not deserve a Nobel Prize for loosing this bloated man-ball on the world but you are hereby kicked out of the Academy of Science.
",14710844,Bender," Wait! As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves.
",13810845,Wernstrom," Young man, you have opened our minds and swayed our hearts. Let us therefore--
",8010846,Bender,"  Party!
",910847,Wernstrom," Bender, you were right! Truly you have lived more in your one week of being human than the rest of us have in our entire lives.
",12910848,Bender," Woo!
",610849,Wernstrom," And so, to recognise your achievements, I hereby award you the Nobel Prize ...  ... in, uh ...  ... Chemistry.
",11210850,Farnsworth," Care to say a few words, Bender?
",3410851,Fry," He's dead.
",1210852,Wernstrom," When did he die?
",1810853,Farnsworth," About 12 hours ago when the party started.
",4410854,Wernstrom," But he just said, ""Woo.""
",2610855,Farnsworth," No, that was air escaping from the folds of his fat.  Goodnight, sweet prince. You were the greatest man any of us will ever know. Well, let's get him out of here. He's starting to smell up the joint.
",20210856,Narrator,"  You watched it, you can't un-watch it. Stay tuned for more Tales of Interest!
",8010857,Farnsworth," Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanthor?
",7710858,Fry," Ooh, I have one. I'm good at video games and bad at everything else. That's why I wish life were more like a video game.
",12210859,Farnsworth," Can you put that in the form of a question?
",4510860,Fry," Uh, what if that thing I said?
",3210861,Farnsworth," Oh, great machine, we beseech thee. What if life were more like a video game?
",7910862,Nixon,"  Good evening, ignorant pigs. Put down your crack pipes and your beer bongs and pay attention as I sign an historic peace accord with Ambassador Kong of planet Nintendu 64.
",17410863,Fry," Wait a second! I know that monkey. His name is Donkey.
",5610864,Farnsworth," Monkeys aren't donkeys! Quit messing with my head!
",5210865,Nixon," I'll just put the old ""John Q. Nixon"" on it.  There! No major crap-ups. You're on, Mr. Ambassador.  What the--
",11210866,Mario," Mamma Mia! The cruel meatball of war has rolled onto our laps and ruined our white pants of peace!
",10010867,Man #1," Mr. Fry, rumour has it you know the secrets of the video game Chance. Please step into the war room.
",10210868,Man #1," You'll be meeting with General Colin Pac-Man.
",4710869,Pac-Man #1," Wakka, wakka, wakka, wakka. Let's get down to business. What can you tell us about the Nintendians?
",10110870,Fry," Well, sir, I spent all of ninth grade studying them, except for that day when my eyeballs started to bleed. And in my opinion--
",12910871,Pac-Man #1," Quickly! To the escape tunnels!
",3310872,Pac-Man #1," This way, damnit!
",1910873,Zoidberg," Mmm, delicious! Just like stale marshmallows!  Ooh, and a cherry!
",6710874,Fry," Hey, watch out!
",1710875,Zoidberg," Uh-oh!
",810876,Leela," Oh, my God! He ate Fry! Fry is dead!
",3810877,Fry," It's OK. I had another guy!
",2910878,Pac-Man #1,"  Wakka ... wakka, wa--
",2410879,Leela,"  Invaders! Possibly from space!
",3310880,Lrrr," People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Nintendu 64. Tremble in fear at our three different kinds of ships.
",11010881,Fry," Alright! It's Saturday night, I have no date, a two-litre bottle of Shasta and my all-Rush mix tape. Let's rock!
",11410882,Ndnd," We're losing ships, Lrrr. What are your orders?
",4910883,Lrrr," Increase speed, drop down and reverse direction!
",5010884,Fry," I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve. Watch, as I fire upwards through our own shields.
",9510885,Bender," He's a madman! A madman!
",2610886,Pac-Man #1," It's working! Victory is assured. My retirement tomorrow will be all the sweeter.  I'm hit! So cold!
",10210887,Ms. Pac-Man #1,"  No!
",610888,Fry," Amy, tend to the widow Pac-Man.
",3310889,Ms. Pac-Man #1,"  Wakka, wakka, wakka.
",2310890,Lrrr," Drop down and increase speed.
",3110891,Zoidberg,"  One ship is left only.
",2510892,Leela," Come on, Fry! Get it!
",2310893,Fry,"  It's moving too fast! Oh, I could never get the last one. My brother always got it for me.
",9310894,Lrrr," Drop down, reverse direction, prepare for landing.
",5210895,Lrrr," You are defeated. Instead of shooting where I was, you should have shot at where I was going to be.
",10110896,Beserk," All your base are belong to us.
",3310897,Q-Bert,"  Where can a guy get a pair of pants around here?
",5110898,Fry," What do you monsters want?
",2810899,Donkey Kong," One thing and one thing only: Quarters! A million allowances worth of quarters! No slugs or tokens.
",10110900,Beserk," Fork 'em over! Fork 'em over!
",3110901,Farnsworth," Forget it, you pixilated pirates. We need those quarters to do our laundry.
",7710902,Amy," Yeah!
",710903,Bender," Right on!
",1110904,Leela," Sure thing, Professor!
",2410905,Lrrr," But-But space invaders need to do laundry too. I mean look at Donkey Kong here. Have you smelled his loincloth lately?
",12010906,Zoidberg," Yes.
",610907,Amy," Go away! We're not giving you our quarters no matter what.
",6010908,Lrrr," Well ... then what if we throw our laundry in with yours? Would that be acceptable?
",8510909,Fry," I guess so.
",1310910,Lrrr," OK, then. That settles that. But if this cape shrinks, consider your species extinct!
",8710911,Narrator,"  Bravo! That'll be hard to top. I pity the next Tale of Interest.
",6710912,Farnsworth," Well, there's time for one last question. Let's turn to the ""Who Ask"" machine to see who's next.
",9810913,Who Ask Machine," Um, uh, um ... Amy.  I mean Leela.
",3610914,Leela," OK.  As an alien who was abandoned on Earth, I've never really belonged anywhere.
",8310915,Bender," Boo-hoo.
",1010916,Fry," Ow!
",510917,Bender," Uh ... where?
",1510918,Leela," So my question is this: What if I found my true home?  Ow!
",6010919,Leela," Where are we?
",1510920,Leela," Nibbler, I don't think we're in New New York anymore.  Jeez! Apparently the phrase ""tone it down"" doesn't exist on this planet.  Oh, no! We hit someone! Quick, back into the ship.  Ooh! Nice boots!
",19910921,Cubert," Look, everyone! She killed the Man-Witch of the West!
",5510922,Leela," A witch? That explains how these boots magically appeared on my feet.
",7110923,Small Glurmo #1," No, you stole them. We saw you.
",3310924,Leela," Well ... i-it's hard to find shoes that fit me. So, anyway, who are you people? Haven't I seen you in some copyrighted movie?
",12710925,Small Glurmo #1,"  We resemble but are legally distinct from the lollipop guild, the lollipop--
",7910926,Amy," Greetings, Leela. I'm the Cute Witch of the North!
",5210927,Leela," Yeah... Can anyone fix my ship so I can get home?
",5110928,Amy," Abraca-duh! Just ask the Professor. He lives in the Emerald Laboratory down Martin Luther King Boulevard.
",10710929,Leela," You mean that yellow brick road?
",3410930,Amy," The city council renamed it in 1975.  Ooh! Those are great shoes!
",6710931,Leela," Oh, thank you.
",1610932,Amy," Do they come in women's sizes?
",3210933,Fry," OK, crow, prepare to be scared.   And then, ""honk, honk,"" the car honked its own horn!
",8810934,Leela," Wow! A talking scarecrow. Wanna come with us to see the Professor? He might be able to give you a brain.
",10610935,Fry," Hey! That's not a nice thing to say.
",3810936,Bender," Beer! Beer!
",1310937,Leela," Whiskey OK?
",1310938,Bender," Now did you say you were off to see the Professor? 'Cause I could use a heart -- a human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement.
",14710939,Zoidberg," And I'm the other guy, courage. Not enough of it. Need some from whatshisname.
",8010940,Mom," Damn this DSL!  Fly, my stupids! Fly out and get them!
",5610941,Igner," But, Mom, you promised you'd bake monkey cake today.
",5410942,Mom," By ""monkey cake"" I meant your ass!
",3610943,Fry," Man, we've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take the wiz.
",7510944,Zoidberg," What, do I smell or something?
",3210945,Leela," Why did you bring us here?
",2810946,Zoidberg," And why did I have to take a cab?
",3510947,Mom," I'll tell you why I brought you here, you twice-baked barf bags: Because I've always wanted a daughter to love. You want to get adopted, you little skank?
",15610948,Leela," And live here? And be a witch like you? Yeah, alright. As long as I get to hurt people and not just dance around at the equinox.
",13010949,Mom," Absolutely.
",1310950,Leela," Oh, Mommy! I found my true home!
",3410951,Bender," Hooray!
",910952,Zoidberg," Alright!
",1010953,Fry," That's great, Leela.
",2210954,Bender," I've heard worse excuses to drink.  Oops!
",4310955,Mom," I'm melting! Oh, who would have thought a small amount of liquid would ever fall on me?
",8910956,Bender," Well, no point letting her go to waste.
",4110957,Hermes,"  Yes?
",710958,Leela," We're here to see the Professor.
",3410959,Hermes,"  No one sees the mighty Professor.
",3610960,Farnsworth,"  Who's there, Hermes? Is it visitors? I want to see them.
",5910961,Hermes,"  It's nobody. Now sign that will I gave you!  He's not here.
",6210962,Leela," Oh, for the love of Benji!
",2810963,Farnsworth," I am the Professor, great and ... uh ... forgetful!  Now, what do you nice kids want?
",8710964,Zoidberg," Nothing! I'm leaving. But if you have extra courage I'd haul it away for you, maybe?
",8610965,Farnsworth," Oh, blithery poop, my cowardly lobster! You don't need courage. After all, who needs courage when you have a gun?
",11510966,Zoidberg," No, world, you put your hands up!
",3510967,Farnsworth," And you, lad, all you need is brain.
",3810968,Fry," Why does everyone keep saying that?
",3710969,Bender," This is a stick-up. Gimme the bag, old man!
",4510970,Farnsworth," Here you go, my friend. 5000 Professor Land fun bucks.
",5610971,Bender," Oh, crap.
",1110972,Farnsworth," As for you, young lady, you want to go home, right?
",5310973,Leela," No, not anymore. I wanna stay here and become the new Wicked Witch.
",6910974,Farnsworth," Nonsense. Now click your big, honking boots together three times and wish to go home to Kansas, to live in poverty with your dirt-farming, teetotalling aunt and uncle.
",16910975,Leela," Uh, alright. Here I go.  There's no place like-- I wanna be a witch!  Oh, no! Help! What's happening?
",10310976,Zoidberg," Uh, sorry. I think there's a problem with your upstairs toilet.
",6510977,Bender," Wake up!
",1010978,Fry," Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
",5310979,Leela," I was having the most wonderful dream.  Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there.
",10410980,Fry," Never mind, Professor. She came to.
",3710981,Farnsworth," Oh! So close.
",1510982,Hermes," There's always next year, Professor. There's always next year.
",6410983,Fry," I've never seen a supernova blow up, but if it's anything like my old Chevy Nova, it'll light up the night sky!
",11310984,Bender," Yeah! Anyone who misses this will regret it the rest of his life. Hey, Fry, could you go make some popcorn?
",10910985,Fry," OK.
",510986,Fry," Let's go, microwave, I'm in a hurry here!  Hm?  Hey, what smells like blue?
",7710987,Leela,"  Fry, get up here! It's starting!
",3510988,Farnsworth," Focus!
",810989,Bender," Oh, boy!
",1010990,Leela," Oh!
",510991,Fry," Hey, which crazy thing happening are you guys screaming about?
",6410992,Zoidberg," My head is spinning.
",2210993,Fry," Ooh! My popcorn's done!
",2510994,Fry," Aw! It's less popped than ever.
",3310995,Leela," I don't know what happened, but we've taken on a lot of clocks.  Let's get back home.
",8710996,Leela," Why is there so little traffic around Earth?
",4610997,Farnsworth," And what's this layer of ozone? That's never been there before.
",6510998,Zoidberg," Such noises!
",1410999,Leela," Oh, no! There's no global positioning signal! Navigation is failing.
",7011000,Fry," We're gonna crash!
",2011001,Leela," Not if I can help it!  Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone, put on your seatbelts.
",7811002,Bender," Ah, those things cost more lives than they save.
",5011003,Fry," Bender, are you OK?
",2111004,Bender," I dunno. I'll try to move my feet.
",3611005,Leela," Alright, here's the plan: Zoidberg, pick up the pieces. Everyone else, take five.
",8311006,Zoidberg," And Zoidberg picks up another piece. The crowd goes wild!  What is?
",6911007,Man #1," General, in all my years of covering top secret discoveries with sheets, I've never dramatically revealed anything as shocking as this. Dun-dun-dun! The debris from an alien spaceship.
",18611008,General," Son, I think I can safely say--
",3311009,Man #1," As you can see, 1947 is going to be an eventful year for the town of ... Roswell, New Mexico.
",9511010,Farnsworth," Remarkable! According the high-precision digital chronograph it's July 9th, 1947, which would explain why the chronograph has turned into this pin-up calendar.
",16111011,Bender," Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?
",5211012,Farnsworth," Doy! Some idiot must have put metal in the microwave--
",5611013,Fry," Yo!
",511014,Farnsworth," And the microwave radiation, combined with the gravitons and graviolis from the supernova, blasted us through time itself.
",12411015,Leela," Have you seen today's news?
",2911016,Bender," High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!
",5511017,Leela," No, over here!   Flying saucer captured!
",4211018,Bender," That's no flying saucer! That's my ass!
",4111019,Fry," My God! This means the flying saucer that crashed in Roswell ... was us!
",7411020,Farnsworth," And the alien they captured was ... was...
",4411021,Zoidberg," Hello!  So what are you guys doing tonight? I'm up for whatever.
",6611022,Farnsworth," Yes, we tore the universe a new space-hole alright! But it's clenching shut fast. Our only hope to get back to our own time is to go through it in, oh, say ...  ... exactly 24 hours.
",18411023,Leela," No problem. The ship's fixed except for the cup holder and I should have that operational within 10 hours.
",10811024,Farnsworth," You've got eight! But a more urgent concern is the microwave.  Without a working one we have no hope of returning to the future.
",13011025,Leela," Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave somewhere around here.  Meanwhile, you guys sneak onto the army base and rescue Bender's body.
",13411026,Fry," Hey, and while we're on the base, I'll visit my grandfather, Enos. He was stationed at Roswell.
",9711027,Farnsworth," Your grandfather?  Stay away from him, you dim-witted monkey. You mustn't interfere with the past. Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to do it. In which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!
",24211028,Fry," Got it.
",911029,Farnsworth," If, for example, you were to kill your grandfather, you would cease to exist.
",7911030,Fry," But existing is basically all I do!
",3711031,General," What is your purpose here?
",2811032,Zoidberg,"  Alright, Officer, I'll move along.
",3711033,Man #1," What the general means is why did you come to Earth?
",5411034,Zoidberg," Not a day goes by I don't ask myself the same question.
",5711035,Sergeant,"  Enos!  Private, I want that toilet bowl so clean I could eat off it! 'Cause I intend to!
",9111036,Enos," Well gadzooks, Sarge!
",2311037,Fry," It's him! It's my grandfather, Enos.
",3811038,Sergeant,"  Now prepare my lunch and place it in the latrine at twelve-hundred hours!
",7611039,Fry," That Jeep's gonna hit him! And I won't exist anymore!  Are you crazy? You almost got yourself run over!
",10511040,Enos," I did? Then I sure am lucky you knocked me onto this pile of rusty bayonets!
",7811041,Bender," Pst! Fry! Stop interfering with history. I don't wanna have to memorise a lot of new kings when I get back.
",10911042,Fry,"  I had no choice; I was about to not exist. I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear.
",9711043,Enos," Well, thanks, soldier. I'm off to make Sarge's lunch! Handling raw chicken, best part of the job!  Mmm! Finger-licking good!
",12611044,Fry," That's it! This place is too dangerous. We gotta get you out of here!   Everything's gonna be alright, Dad!
",10911045,Enos," Well gadzooks! I'd better ask Sarge.
",3811046,Fry,"  No time! Run! Run to safety!
",3111047,Man #1," This experiment will determine what food, if any, the alien eats.
",6711048,Zoidberg," A buffet! Oh, if only I had my wallet with me!
",4811049,Man #1," Um, it's free.
",1611050,General," Get me the President.
",2311051,Leela," Fry's from around this time. I'll talk like him.  Yo, homes! We're looking for a microwave oven.
",9811052,Salesman #1," Microwave? Never heard of that brand, sweetheart. What you want is the ""Deluxe Gas Princess"".  This beauty has four broilers, a casserole indicator, a fold-out ironing board and, down here, a foot-soaking tub. Since, as a woman, you'll be standing in front of it all day.
",27311053,Leela," Oh, I'm sorry. Now I'll aks you again: Where can we find a mi-cro-wave?
",7311054,Salesman #1," Sir, your wife's hysterical, so I'll address this to you. This oven is lightning fast. It takes only five hours to cook a roast.
",13011055,Farnsworth," Ooh, that's good news! You know, you really don't cook enough roasts, Leela.  Women!
",8611056,Fry," Thank God I got you off that dangerous army base.
",5111057,Enos," You sure are the helpful type, stranger. Say, you got anything to eat in that there lunchbox?  Ooh! Snacks!
",10911058,Bender," Hey! That's my brain!
",2311059,Enos," Damn! Them crackers cut my mouth up somethin' bad! Let's stop off for a malt.
",7911060,Enos," See that waitress there?
",2611061,Fry," Yowza! I know what I want for dessert!
",4011062,Enos," That's my fiancÃ©e, Mildred.
",2911063,Fry," Grandma Mildred? Uh, no dessert! Just coffee.
",4711064,Mildred," Okie-doke. And for you, Snuggums?
",3511065,Enos," Uh, I'll have a pie with a fried egg on top.
",4611066,Fry," She sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away.
",8111067,Enos," Yeah, folks say that. But did you ever get the feeling you're only going with girls 'cause you're supposed to?
",11211068,Fry," What? Don't ever, ever say or think that again! Please! Just concentrate on staying alive.  Fire! Look out!  Oh! You almost got neutered.
",13911069,Enos," Well it ain't as bad as getting killed.
",4111070,Fry," For me it is!  I'm getting you outta here!
",4411071,Enos," Ow!
",511072,Fry," OK, we're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere. Just stay put and enjoy this calendar.
",11311073,Fry," Safe and sound! Finally, I can continue to exist.
",5111074,Man #1 #2," Three, two, one.
",1811075,Bender," And you are outta here!
",2511076,Mildred," What'll you folks have today?
",3111077,Farnsworth," I'll have the soylent green, with a slice of soylent orange and some soylent coleslaw.
",8811078,Mildred," Pardon?
",911079,Leela,"  It's the 20th century, Professor.
",3611080,Farnsworth," Oh, right! I'll have a croque monsieur, the paella, two mutton pills and a stein of mead.
",9111081,Leela," I'll just have a small injection of Femislim.
",4711082,Mildred," Uh, two chilli dogs comin' up.
",3211083,Leela," Well, settle in. Without a microwave we're trapped in this time period.
",7311084,Farnsworth," Oh, Lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the Big Bopper and then the terrible tragedy of his death.
",11311085,Leela," Wait a second! There's a microwave radar dish at the army base.  We could steal it!
",8511086,Farnsworth," No! That would alter history. Above all else, it is our sacred duty to preserve the past exactly as it was.
",10911087,Fry," Well, I killed my grandfather.
",3211088,Farnsworth," Wha?
",611089,Leela," Wait. If you killed your grandfather, why do you still exist?
",6311090,Fry," I dunno. Maybe God loves me.
",3011091,Mildred," Killed? In an atomic blast?  No, sir, I'm afraid I don't take much solace in the fact that the implosion trigger functioned perfectly.
",13611092,Fry," Aw. There, there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vaporised so there's no chance of him coming back as a zombie.
",12811093,Mildred,"  I'm not worried about that.
",3011094,Fry," Then you're a braver woman than I.
",3611095,Mildred," You remind me of Enos. Would you mind walking me home?
",5611096,Fry," Uh, how far is it?
",2011097,General," Welcome to Roswell, President Truman.
",3911098,Truman," Fellas, this visit's top secret. No one's to know about it except the senior officers ...  ... scientists ...  ... and a single conspiracy nutter no one will believe.
",16811099,General," Mr. President, our men have assembled the parts from the alien ship into its original design.
",9511100,Truman," Whistling Dixie! I want this sent to Area 51 for study.
",5711101,General," But, sir, that's where we're building the fake moon landing set.
",6611102,Truman," Then we'll have to really land on the moon. Invent NASA and tell them to get off their fannies!
",9711103,Truman," If you come in peace, surrender or be destroyed. If you're here to make war, we surrender.
",9211104,Zoidberg," Both good. The important thing is I'm meeting new people.
",5911105,Truman," Bushwah! Now what's your mission? Are you planning to make some kind of alien-human hybrid?
",9311106,Zoidberg," Are you coming onto me?
",2511107,Truman," Hot crackers! I take exception to that!
",4111108,Zoidberg,"  I'm not hearing a no.
",2411109,Truman," Nerks to this space crab! If we want information, we'll have to do us an old-fashioned alien autopsy!
",10311110,Zoidberg," Hooray!
",911111,Mildred,"  Every little thing reminds me of Enos.
",4111112,Fry," Aw, I know how you feel. My grandfather died recently.
",5611113,Mildred," It's all so sad. At times like this, I just need someone to hold me.  Mmm.  You like holding me, don't you?
",10911114,Fry," Hey, you know what always cheers you up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!
",8211115,Mildred," How 'bout these cookies, sugar?
",3311116,Fry," I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't even exist. But I do exist. Which proves ... you can't really be my grandm--
",11111117,Bender,"  Oh, my God!
",1411118,Farnsworth," What the hell have you done, Fry?
",3511119,Fry," Relax! She can't be my grandmother. I figured it all out.
",5911120,Farnsworth," Of course she's your grandmother, you perverted dope! Look!
",6111121,Mildred," Come back to bed, deary.
",2611122,Fry," It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?
",7311123,Farnsworth," Isn't it obvious?  You are!
",2911124,Mildred," Did you say something, deary? I'm a bit hard of hearing.
",5811125,Pathologist #1," Commencing excavation of the subject's chest cavity.
",5411126,Zoidberg," And in this corner, Zoidberg!  C'mon! Lighten up! What is this, a funeral?
",7611127,Pathologist #2," Heart.
",811128,Zoidberg," Take, I've got four of them.
",3011129,Pathologist #1," Stomach contents: One deviled egg.
",3611130,Zoidberg," Deviled egg?
",1411131,Pathologist #1," The same deviled egg.
",2311132,Leela," Snap out of it!
",1711133,Farnsworth," Start the ship, Leela. Let's just steal the damn radar dish and get back to our own time.
",9111134,Fry," But-- But won't that change history?
",3811135,Farnsworth,"  Oh, a lesson in not changing history from Mr. I'm-My-Own-Grandpa! Let's get the hell out of here already! Screw history!
",12311136,Conspiracy Nutter," UFO! UFO!
",1111137,Zoidberg," Hey, don't cut that! I need that to speak!
",4411138,Pathologist #2," Oh, my!
",911139,Truman," Sweet Roosevelt's ghost!
",2611140,Leela," Hi-yah!  Yah!  Yah!
",2111141,Fry," Take this, Mr. President-- Sir!
",3311142,Zoidberg," The President is gagging on my gas bladder! What an honour!
",6111143,Farnsworth," Huh, wha? Oh, right!
",2211144,Sergeant,"  Enos!
",811145,Fry,"  He's dead! Sorry!
",2011146,Fry," Yay!
",611147,Farnsworth," Choke on that, causality!
",2711148,Bender,"  1947 can kiss my shiny metal--
",3311149,Fry," Turn around. We've gotta go back for Bender!
",4611150,Farnsworth," Impossible! The supernova time hole is closing! If we don't leave now, we'll never get back to the 31st century.
",11411151,Fry,"  Bender!
",1011152,Zoidberg," There! Good as new!
",2111153,Leela," Don't you need this one?
",2611154,Zoidberg," Oh, no! That's my--  Gotcha!
",3011155,Fry," Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely right now, trapped a thousand years in the past. Hey! Wait a second!
",10811156,Leela," Anything?
",1111157,Fry," No.  Wait!
",1211158,Bender," Ow! Stupid junk!
",1811159,Fry," He's alive!  Bender, what was it like lying in that hole for a thousand years?
",8011160,Bender," I was enjoying it until you guys showed up.
",4511161,Farnsworth," Well, now everything is back as it was. And if history doesn't care that out degenerate friend Fry is his own grandfather then who are we to judge?
",14911162,Bender," Amen!
",711163,Leela," Space pirates!
",1611164,Fry," Space pirates?
",1611165,Leela," You know. Pirates, but in space.
",3411166,Pirate,"  Avast, mateys!
",1711167,Pirate," Electronically transfer your space doubloons, afore I send thee to Davey Jarg's locker!
",8911168,Bender,"  Hey! Keep it down, you kids! I'm trying to take a nap!
",5711169,Fry," Come on! Come on!
",1911170,Bender,"  Make Bender take a nap in a tube.   Come back when I've had some sleep, baby!
",8011171,Leela," Fry to battlestations. Fire torpedo number three.
",5111172,Fry," Firing torpedo number three!
",3011173,Bender," Huh? What?
",1211174,Leela," That's not torpedo three. That's not torpedo three at all!
",6011175,Bender," Damn you, Fry and Lee--  --la!
",3211176,Pirate,"  Too late do I realise that me children are me only real treasures.
",6911177,Bender,"  Help! Mechanical man overboard!
",3411178,Fry," Go after him, Leela!
",2211179,Leela," It's no use. We were going full speed when we fired him so he's going even faster than that.
",9411180,Fry," You mean we can never catch up to him? Not even if we rub the engine with cheetah blood?
",9011181,Leela," I don't know how to say this, Fry, but Bender is doomed to drift through space ... forever.
",9311182,Fry,"  He always wanted to drift forever, but through the American Southwest.
",7311183,Bender," I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose momentum.  I'm gonna spend eternity alone with barely any swag.  Ooh! Hey, universe, check out the dude with the Rolex!  Wow! Ostentatious!  Except what good is a candelabra without-- Wait! I know!  Ah, the pity. Fated to drift forever through the void as gravity's plaything. Oh, cruel fate, to be thusly boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones. It bones for thee. The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art.  Damn you!
",51511184,Bender," There! Now when I'm found in a million years people will know what the score was.  Hey! what's bombarding me?  Oh, no! An asteroid field. If even a pea-sized asteroid were to whiz through my skull it could--  Ow! Hurt slightly!  Well that was fun. Now for eons of loneliness.
",27711185,Bender," Huh?
",611186,Shrimpkin Priest," Fellow Shrimpkins, behold him who hath taken us unto his breast.
",6611187,Bender," Holy frijoles!
",1611188,Shrimpkin Priest," All bow before the great Metal Lord!
",3811189,Bender," Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless, tragic voyage.
",6411190,Shrimpkin Priest," All hail the Metal Lord!
",2611191,Shrimpkins,"  So hailed!
",1311192,Bender," Hmm. Those peewees think I'm God, huh? Hard to blame 'em!  I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?
",9411193,Malachi," I am called Malachi, Lord. It means, um, ""He who really loves the Metal Lord"".
",8011194,Bender," Listen here, Malachi. Time for a religious donation. Hand over your wallet.
",7711195,Malachi," But, Lord, we are a poor and simple folk.
",4311196,Bender," Poor? Oh, crap.
",1711197,Malachi," Pity me not, for I am richened by the love of my family.
",5811198,Malachis Wife," What art thou doing, Malachi Jr.?
",3511199,Malachi Jr.," I'm practising to hug Daddy when he gets back from God.  Mmm! Mmm!
",6811200,Bender," Eck! Gag unto me with a spoon! Malachi, it's high time I laid down a few commandments. You got a chisel? Take this down.  Number one...
",13711201,Malachi," Behold: The One Commandment.
",3011202,Bender,"  Make it a double!
",2011203,Fry," Can you find him, Professor?
",3011204,Farnsworth," No. I'm afraid the Smellescope isn't powerful enough. Bender's odour is so mild it's being overpowered by local sources.
",12211205,Zoidberg," Hooray! People are paying attention to me!
",4411206,Amy," Fry, we brought someone to cheer you up.
",4211207,Hermes," His name is Helper and he's eager to be your new best friend.
",6311208,Helper," Hello there, chum. I understand you miss your buddy. Have a pudding pop!
",7411209,Fry," No, thanks, I don't--
",2311210,Helper," Who wants to go to an amusement park?
",3911211,Fry," Well, I guess that sounds OK.
",3111212,Helper," Have a good time. Hey, I heard your friend Bender is back.
",6011213,Fry," What? Really?
",1511214,Helper," No. I just thought you would enjoy that for a moment.
",5511215,Bender," Ooh! Microbrewed! My guys did alright! I think I'll make my countenance to shine down upon them.  Malachi, good work. There's no slowing down with the Metal Lord tonight.
",17211216,Malachi," Yes, tonight is kind of special.
",3411217,Bender," Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?
",5611218,Malachi," Nay. Like most of your followers, I was maimed while building the Great Brewery.  Others died from the pestilent fumes it spewed forth.  And, of course, the liquor industry attracted organised crime.
",20111219,Bender," It's all my fault. Malachi, tell thy people that the Lord is moved by their plight.
",8511220,Malachis Wife," Malachi Jr., no!
",1811221,Malachi Jr.," Daddy, I can't hold much longer. My arms are tired from hugging.
",6611222,Malachi," Save him! Save my son, oh Metal Lord!
",3911223,Bender," This looks like a job for God!  What the-- Malachi, what manner of deal is this with the chanting?
",10011224,Malachi," They saw you save my son. Now everyone is praying for their own miracles.
",7511225,Bender," Very well. What do they want?
",3111226,Malachi," The people of that village pray for wealth.
",4511227,Bender," Um, that was a practice miracle. Who's next?
",4611228,Malachi," The farmers pray for sunlight so their barley might make a more refreshing beer for today's God on the go.
",10811229,Bender," Very well. Let there be light.  I got it! I got it!  Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle.
",13111230,Fry," He decided not to let go.  I can't believe you're gone. I won't! If I can't reach you physically, I'll just have to try something desperate and crazy!
",15211231,Fry," So that's my story, Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion can do to help me find my friend?
",11111232,Changstein el Gamahl," Well, we could join together in prayer.
",4111233,Fry," Uh-huh. But is there anything useful we can do?
",4911234,Changstein el Gamahl," No.
",511235,Gypsy," Sure I hold sÃ©ance, channel your friend, no problem. Insert coin.  I am your friend, Bonder.
",9411236,Fry," Bonder? Is it really you?
",2711237,Gypsy," Yes. I am fine. Give the gypsy $10.
",3711238,Fry," Wait a minute! Bender's name isn't Bonder, it's Bender. You're a fraud!
",7311239,Gypsy," Look, you want false hope or not?
",3511240,Fry," Only if you don't have any real hope.
",3911241,Gypsy," Well, there is perhaps one way. Have you heard of the Monks of Dschubba?
",7411242,Fry," I've not heard of them.
",2511243,Gypsy," They are an ancient order that believes God exists somewhere in the depths of space. They have built the universe's most powerful radio telescope, high in the Himalayas, to search for him.
",19011244,Fry," You think they'd let me use it to look for Bender?
",5211245,Gypsy," What am I, psychic? I mean, yes! Yes, I'm-I'm sure they will. Yes.
",6811246,Malachi," Oh, Metal Lord, hear my prayer.
",3311247,Bender,"  Yes, Malachi, what is it this time?
",3811248,Malachi," My Lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say their prayers go unheeded.
",9811249,Bender," Of course they're unheeded. How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?
",8511250,Malachi," They talk of war against the faithful. I beseech thee. Rise up against them. Smite someone who deserves it for once.
",11811251,Bender," Malachi, every time I interfere, I only make things worse. You're best off solving your own problems.
",10311252,Malachi," But-But Metal Lord.
",2111253,Bender," What part of ""nay"" doesn't thou understand?
",4511254,Fry," Sir, I'm outfitting an expedition to a monastery high in the Himalayas. I'll need a long-sleeved coat.
",10411255,Leela," Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do but you can't bring him back this way. It's hopeless.
",10511256,Fry," You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless. You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go ""blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!""   I'd also like a pack mule.
",18311257,Salesman #1,"  At once, sir!
",1611258,Leela," Well, you obviously won't listen to reason, so I guess I'll listen to idiotic-ness and come with you. But we'll need a sherpa to guide us.
",14011259,Bender," Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint on every page! Looks like society's running pretty well without my meddling--  Atomic bombs? Oh, no! Those unbelievers from my backside must have found my nuclear pile!
",21511260,Malachi," Fear not, my Lord. We shall be with you soon.
",4711261,Bender," You're with me now. This is the maximum level of being with me!
",6511262,Malachi," We will solve our own problems as you commanded. The time has come to convert the unbelievers.
",9611263,Bender," Convert them?
",1511264,Malachi," To radioactive vapour!
",2411265,Malachi Jr.," Look, Daddy! I'm hugging God. Mmm! Mmm! Maybe if I hug him real hard he'll save us from--
",9111266,Bender,"  No!   Ooh! It tickles!
",2511267,Bender," Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theatre?  Don't be embarrassed.   They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences?
",18411268,Leela,"  Fry, if I drop dead from exhaustion, make sure my body freezes in a dignified position. None of that ""huddled over for warmth"" crap.
",13511269,Namgyal," Behold. The Monastery of Dschubba. I must leave you now for I am not holy enough to enter.
",9211270,Fry," OK.
",511271,Leela," Looks rickety. We'd better test it.
",3711272,Female Voice," Welcome to our monastery. Please stand to one side to let faster pilgrims by.
",7911273,Bender," Hey! That galaxy's signalling in binary. I gotta signal back. But I only know enough binary to ask where the bathroom is.  You speak English?
",14311274,Galaxy," I do now.
",1111275,Bender," What are you? Some kind of galactic computer?
",4711276,Galaxy," Possible. I am user friendly, my good chum.
",4511277,Bender," Who built you?
",1611278,Galaxy," I have always been.
",2111279,Bender," Oh, my God. Are you God?
",2611280,God," Possible. I do feel compassion for all living things, my good chum.
",6911281,Bender," But why would God think in binary? Unless ... you're not God, but the remains of a computerised space probe that collided with God.
",13311282,God," That seems probable.
",2211283,Monk #1," A member of our brotherhood sits at these controls every hour of every day, scanning the heavens for God.
",10711284,Monk #2," There he is! No. No, wait, no.
",3211285,Leela," How long have you been at it?
",3111286,Monk #1," 700 years. We've not yet examined one-ten-millionth of the sky. But we will go on until we find the Almighty, even if it takes till the end of time.
",15011287,Fry," And then what?
",1611288,Monk #1," Then we utter unto him a short prayer. You see, the telescope is also an amplifying transmitter.
",9811289,Leela," Sort of like a giant karaoke machine?
",3911290,Monk #1," Not really. Would you like to see our giant karaoke machine?
",6211291,Leela," Not really.
",1311292,Fry," Hmm. Finding God. That-That's important, yeah. But you know what might be a treat for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend, Bender.
",16111293,Monk #1," I don't know what to say, other than ""absolutely not"". Your loss is a tragedy but our work--
",9411294,Fry," Aw, come on! You guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one measly lifetime to find my friend.
",11011295,Monk #2," He speaks out of love for his friend. Perhaps that love in his heart is God.
",7811296,Monk #1," Oh, how convenient! A theory about God that doesn't require looking through a telescope. Get back to work!
",10811297,Fry," That telescope is as much mine as anybody's. I'm using it whether you give me permission or not.
",9811298,Leela," Hi-yah! Your order may be famous for your martial arts, but I've never met a holy man I couldn't clobber.
",10711299,Monk #1," Actually, we only practise martial arts as a form of meditation. We are a strictly non-violent sect.
",10211300,Leela," Oh. Then get in the laundry room or I'll kick your butts!
",5911301,Monk #3," This is the worst crazy sect I've ever been in.
",4911302,Bender," So, do you know what I'm gonna do before I do it?
",5111303,God," Yes.
",611304,Bender," What if I do something different?
",3511305,God," Then I don't know that.
",2511306,Bender," Cool! Cool! I bet a lot of people pray to you, huh?
",5311307,God," Yes. But there are so many asking so much. After a while, you just sorta tune it out.
",8711308,Bender," Y'know, I was God once.
",2511309,God," Yes, I saw. You were doing well until everyone died.
",5411310,Bender," It was awful. I tried helping them, I tried not helping them but in the end I couldn't do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?
",14111311,God," Right and wrong are just words. What matters is what you do.
",6211312,Bender," Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what I did-- Forget it.
",6011313,God," Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you. And if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch like a safecracker or a pickpocket.
",18511314,Bender," Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money.
",5811315,God," Yes, if you make it look like an electrical thing. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
",12811316,Bender," Does that mean you wouldn't send me back to Earth even if I prayed to you?
",7611317,God," Earth? Which way is that?
",2711318,Bender,"  I don't know.
",1611319,Fry,"  Bender? Bender?
",1811320,Monk #2,"  Let us out! We cooked our shoes in the dryer and ate them. Now we're bored.
",7811321,Fry,"  Hello? Has anyone out there seen Bender?
",4311322,H.G. Blob,"  No! Quit asking.
",1911323,Leela," Fry, it's been three days. And even if you stay here the rest of your life, there is virtually no chance of finding him. It's time to give up.
",14411324,Fry,"  You're right. I'm never gonna see him again. I know he was evil and on more than one occasion he-he actually stole my blood.  But still, I wish I had Bender back.
",16511325,God," Huh?
",611326,Bender," Huh? Wha? You say something?
",3011327,God," No, no. Well, so long. Remember what we talked about.
",5511328,Bender," Hot, hot, hot, hot!
",2111329,Fry," Bender! It's a miracle!  Ow!
",3011330,Leela," This is, by a wide margin, the least likely thing that has ever happened.
",7511331,Bender," Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God, then I met God!
",7611332,Fry," We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks.
",4911333,Leela," Oh, no! The monks! We forgot to let them out of the laundry room.
",6711334,Fry," Do we have to? I mean, they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them out or at least give them more shoes to eat.
",11711335,Bender," Fat chance! You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me so himself. Now come on. If we don't save those monks, no one will!
",13711336,God," When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
",7711337,Man #1," Yes! Good thing I noticed the similar shapes.
",4711338,Hermes,"  Planet Express stockholders, I present our chief executive officer, Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
",9911339,Farnsworth," Oh!
",511340,Amy," There he is!
",1411341,Hattie McDoogal,"  Take it off!
",1511342,Farnsworth," Where am I?
",1311343,Hermes," Move forward. Walk into the light.
",3611344,Farnsworth," Oh, God, I'm dead! Well, no matter.   Thank you all for coming. I don't recognise any of you, nor can I recall why I am here. Now, without further ado, a film highlighting Planet Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year.
",21511345,Narrator,"  Planet Express is on the move. For this hip, young delivery company, tomorrow is today and today is yesterday. You heard me.  It was a year of soaring profits and significant one-time losses.
",19411346,Fry,"  Psst! Watching myself work is making me hungry. Help me find some food somewhere.
",8411347,Zoidberg," I'll not only help you find it, I'll help you do more to it!
",6211348,Fry," Ooh! A Bot Mitzvah. Shalom, hunger! Shalom, free food!
",5611349,Robot #1 #1," No shellfish!
",1511350,Zoidberg," That is so unfair!
",2011351,Pig," Tell me about it.
",1911352,Fry," So what's the deal? You guys don't believe in Robot Jesus?
",6011353,Rabbi-bot," We believe he was built and that he was a very well programmed robot. But he wasn't our Messiah.
",9811354,Narrator,"  And so our company flames onwards. Planet Express: Limitless potential, boundless horizons, the unstoppable juggernaut of the corporate universe.
",14811355,Hermes," It's been a terrible year, people. The company is on the verge of bankruptcy.
",7911356,Leela," But the movie--
",1711357,Hermes," Was a substantial loss for the company.  The blue slice represents the money we earned from shipping packages, while the green slice represents an $8 bank error in our favour.
",17711358,Leela," This toads the wet sprocket. What about out thousands of shares of stock?
",7511359,Hermes," Worthless.
",1211360,Bender,"  I'll kill you!
",1711361,Hattie McDoogal," I own one share of Planet kajiggers so I'm entitled to some answers. Question 1: Why does no one visit me in my home?
",11911362,Farnsworth," 'Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee.
",5711363,Fry," This is perfect for me.
",2511364,Zoidberg," Question: Do you have to have been cryogenically frozen to get the free--  You didn't let me finish. I was going to say ""to get the free food"".
",14511365,Joe," My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee.
",3611366,All,"  Hello, Joe.
",1411367,Joe," When I was frozen, giant carrots ruled the Earth, but now they don't. It takes some getting used to.
",10211368,Steve Castle," Back in the 1980's, I was the toast of Wall Street. I was having whiskey with Boesky and cookies with Milken. But then, I was diagnosed with terminal boneitis.
",16111369,Fry," Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for a horrible disease.
",6011370,Steve Castle," There was no cure at the time. One drug company was close but I arranged a hostile takeover and sold off all the assets. Made a cool hundred mil.  Naturally I froze myself until a cure was found. Now here I am, ready to sleaze my way back to the top, 80's style!
",26411371,Caveman," As a caveman frozen in a glacier, I face different challenges.  The hardest thing was seeing my wife on display in the British Museum.
",13611372,Fry,"  Hey, buddy, I'm from the same time as you. Remember that song, Safety Dance?
",7911373,Steve Castle," Sure do! We can dance!
",2411374,Fry," Y'know, that dance wasn't as safe as they said it was.
",5611375,Steve Castle," I tell you: Two go-go 80's Reagan-auts like us, we could rule this world!
",7511376,Fry," No question!
",1411377,Steve Castle," If only someone would give us a shot.
",3911378,Fry," They're scared of our raw power. Oh, but if you want a job, I could beg everyone at the company where I work.
",11111379,Steve Castle," Awesome. Awesome to the max!
",3011380,Hermes," And finally, the post office meter is for business mail only.
",6311381,Bender," Aw, come on! I've got a lot of ransom notes to send!
",5411382,Hattie McDoogal," Enough talk. It's time for action. I move that everyone come to my apartment to snuggle my cat.
",9711383,Scruffy," Second.
",911384,Farnsworth," I move that your cat stinks and is ugly.
",4211385,Scruffy," Second.
",911386,Hattie McDoogal," I move that we vote on a new chief executive officer and oust this old creep. And also that make cat smells good and is pretty.
",12911387,Scruffy," Second.
",911388,Hermes," Very well. I nominate the Professor.
",3811389,Amy," Second.
",911390,Leela," Second.
",911391,Bender," Second.
",911392,Farnsworth," I'm your man.
",1511393,Leela," I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor.
",4411394,Hermes," Yeah, the Professor!
",2211395,Farnsworth," Me!
",511396,Fry," I nominate That Guy. Not just because he has a suit but because he knows about business and stuff and he has a tie.  My shares still count if they went through the washing machine, right?
",18911397,Hermes," Well, if I know anything about which number is bigger than the other number, I'd say that--
",9311398,Scruffy," Now hold on there. Scruffy votes his 40,000 shares for the mysterious stranger.
",8111399,Leela," 40,000? How come you have four-times as much stock as the rest of us?
",7111400,Scruffy," Scruffy believes in this company.
",3511401,Hermes," Then we have a tie. And in the event of a tie, the Professor, as the current CEO remains--
",9211402,Hattie McDoogal," I demand the floor. I may only have one share but I get to vote same as anyone. And I'm voting against the cat-hater.  Isn't that right, kitty?  Hey! You ate my change!
",17011403,Hermes," Then it's settled. The new chief executive officer of Planet Express corporation is That Guy.
",9511404,Hermes," Please welcome our new chief executive officer, That Guy.
",5911405,Steve Castle," Let's cut to the chase. There are two kinds of people: Sheep and sharks. Anyone who's a sheep is fired. Who's a sheep?
",12011406,Zoidberg," Uh, excuse me? Which is the one people like to hug?
",5311407,Steve Castle," Gutsy question. You're a shark. Sharks are winners and they don't look back 'cause they don't have necks. Necks are for sheep.  I am proud to be the shepherd of this herd of sharks and I am gonna lead you to the top in this industry of ... of--
",24611408,Fry,"  Package delivery.
",2011409,Steve Castle," Package delivery? Oh, God!  Fantastic! Now, the first order of business is to blame everything on the guy before me. Professor?
",12911410,Farnsworth," I'll ruin you like I ruined this company.
",4311411,Steve Castle," Terrific. Question number one: What was your overall business plan?
",6911412,Farnsworth," Um, business plan, uh, yes. I keep it here, right next to my heart.
",6911413,Steve Castle," This isn't a business plan, it's an escape plan.
",5011414,Farnsworth," So long, suckers!
",1911415,Steve Castle," Fry, as a fellow 80's dollar-jockey, I'm making you my new vice chairman.
",7511416,Fry," I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.
",3611417,Zoidberg," It's the end of the line!
",2711418,Hermes," We're ruined!
",1511419,Scruffy," What fevered dream is this that bids to tear this company in twain?
",6911420,Monster," Thank you, come again!
",2411421,Steve Castle," That's what I call a hostile makeover! Hair gel?
",5011422,Fry," No, thanks. I make my own.
",2811423,Steve Castle," This company's gonna shoot straight to the top and stay there, like Cindy Lauper! I ask you: Who is the number one delivery service on Earth?
",14311424,Zoidberg," Is it Planet Express, master?
",3111425,Steve Castle," Is this guy a shark, or what? Seriously though, we stink out loud. Here's the big enchirito.  Mom's Friendly Delivery Company.
",12811426,Hermes," We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil. Ours is small and neutral.
",8411427,Steve Castle," Switzerland is small and neutral. We're more like Germany; ambitious and misunderstood.
",8911428,Amy," Look, everyone wants to be like Germany but do we really have the pure strength of will?
",9011429,Steve Castle," I say we do! Now are we gonna let ourselves get beaten by an old lady?
",7211430,Zoidberg," Yes, my liege!
",1611431,Fry," No, we're not. And as vice chairman, I believe I speak for the entire board when I issue this challenge to Mom.  Look at my butt!
",13111432,Mom," You call that a pressed ham? Walt, hit the retaliate button.
",6211433,Walt," Uh ... um ... hmm ... let's see.
",3411434,Mom,"  Any button! They all retaliate!
",3411435,Fry," Woo! Yeah! Hit him, hit him, hit him!  Now this is the high life; watching apes mangle each other near celebrities.
",11711436,Steve Castle," In my day we went to coke parties but the principle's the same.
",6511437,Calculon," Get your stinkin' trike off me, you damn dirty ape.
",5311438,Steve Castle," Listen, big guy, now that you're my protÃ©gÃ©, it's time I cut you in on the secret to success. Any guesses?
",10811439,Fry," Uh, work really, really hard?
",3111440,Steve Castle," No.
",511441,Fry," Oh, thank God!
",1611442,Steve Castle," It's all about appearances. That's why it's time to update our company's stodgy image and give it the sleek, dazzling veneer of the 1980's!
",14111443,Fry," This company's on the fast track to the ""It"" list. Blast back kudos all around!
",8111444,Leela," Uh, hello? We haven't made one delivery since you two took over.
",6611445,Steve Castle," Delivery has nothing to do with the delivery business. Image, people, image! Scope out this new ad!
",10111446,Mom,"  We are all one, with one mind, one purpose and one act. Our enemies shall be eaten by squirrels.  We shall bow down and worship to ourselves.  We shall prevail!
",16311447,Man #1,"  Hey! We were watching that!
",3011448,Leela," That was terrible! People won't even know what we do.
",5511449,Bender," I don't even know what we do. Nah, just kidding! What are, like, a bus or something?
",8611450,Leela," Did you approve that awful ad, Fry?
",3711451,Fry," Yes I did, Leels. And I'll tell you why. Because it grows the brand.
",7011452,Leela," Oh, Lord!
",1111453,Zoidberg," This company's circling the drain, I tell you. I'd sell my stock right now for a sandwich!
",9211454,Steve Castle," Sold!
",711455,Zoidberg," A complete sangwich?  You got fleeced! I would have settled for a hard roll with ketchup inside!
",9811456,Mom," What is this moose drip?   The new delivery kings?  I'm sick of hearing about those turtle squirts!
",10111457,Igner," But they're kings, Mommy!
",2711458,Mom," Jam a bastard in it, you crap!
",3211459,Elzar," Enjoy our private dining room, folks. This is where we serve our richest, most successful chumps!
",9911460,Fry," Tonight, that's us!
",2111461,Steve Castle," What have you got that's really overpriced?
",4511462,Elzar," Everything.
",1311463,Steve Castle," Bring me that.
",1611464,Fry," Make it two. And a glass of all your water.
",4511465,Steve Castle," OK, let's work on your execu-speak. I'm worried about ""blank"".
",6411466,Fry," Don't you worry about ""blank"". Let me worry about ""blank"".
",6011467,Steve Castle," Good. I also would have accepted, ""Blank? Blank? You're not looking at the big picture!""
",9011468,Fry,"  What a pleasant surprise!
",2811469,Mom," Shut up, booger blaster! It's time the three of us had a talk.
",6411470,Steve Castle," I'll handle this, Fry. You get back to the farm, shift some paradigms, revolutionise outside the box.
",10311471,Fry," I'm on it. But if you need me, you know where I'll be.
",5611472,Fry,"  Call me a ""booger blaster""! I'll blast a booger so hard that--
",6511473,Leela," Fry, we're worried about Planet Express.
",4211474,Fry," Don't you worry about Planet Express. Let me worry about ""blank"".
",6711475,Hermes," That Guy is nothing but a flashy con man! And you've been hypnotised by his swinging baloney!
",9511476,Leela," You've changed, Fry.
",2211477,Fry," What? I haven't changed.  Suz? Have I changed?
",4811478,Suz,"  No, sir, Mr. Fry.
",2011479,Fry," Thanks, doll.
",1511480,Leela," I don't care what Ms. Johnson says. That Guy's turning this place into some kind of business.
",9511481,Farnsworth," This isn't a business. I've always thought of it more as a source of cheap labour, like a family.
",9911482,Fry," You're right, Professor. We might not be a traditional family like the Murphy's next door or the lesbian coven across the street. But we are a family and That Guy understands that.
",18211483,Steve Castle,"  Everyone's fired and we're out of business.
",4611484,Amy," Oh, no!
",911485,Hermes," How?
",611486,Steve Castle,"  I'm gonna sell Planet Express to Mom so she can gut the company and eliminate us as competitors.
",9911487,Mom,"  Don't let the door hit you on the way out, 'cause I don't want ass prints on my new door!
",9211488,Fry," Uh, Ms. Johnson? Please bring in some more chair fuel.
",5611489,Fry," I had no idea the company would be sold. I was just an innocent suck-up. You've gotta believe me!
",9911490,Leela," Just leave us alone and let us clear out our lockers.
",5511491,Bender," Yeah!
",711492,Amy,"  It's so sad, where will I go? What will I do?
",4811493,Lackey," You have Mrs. Darlinghaven's cotillion at 7, ma'am.
",5311494,Amy,"  Oh. That'll be fun.
",2211495,Fry," Ms. Johnson, you've never lied to me. Am I still a good person?
",6511496,Suz,"  I don't know, sir. I'm a program built into the intercom.
",6011497,Fry," I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, sometime, for some reason. I'll block this takeover!
",9011498,Suz,"  Mr. Fry, your two o'clock magician is here.
",4611499,Fry," Believe it or not, I have more important things to do today than laugh and clap my hands.  Reschedule.
",10411500,Broker-bot #1,"  Sell 100 soylent beans!
",2611501,Broker-bot #2,"  Buy 3,000 cornbellies!
",2511502,Broker-bot #3,"  200 canned whoop-ass!
",2411503,Broker-bot #1,"  Three big bags of trash!
",2711504,Jor-El," Attention, please. The takeover of PlanEx Corp. by Mom's Delivery Company will take place in the business centre in 10 minutes. I am Jor-El, master of scheduling!
",16411505,Steve Castle," OK. We've got the hot tub hot, the wine cooler's cool. It's Hammer time!
",7411506,Bender," You suck!
",1111507,Mom," According to regulations, both companies must approve the takeover. Planet Express shareholders, cast your votes.
",11511508,Hermes," Great Bonda of Uganda! We can vote against it!
",4811509,Bender," I'll vote it down like a raise for school teachers!
",5311510,Bender," What the--?
",1311511,Hattie McDoogal," How the--?
",1211512,Amy," Oh, no!
",911513,Steve Castle," I neglected to mention that the shares I bought from Dr. Zoidberg gave me majority control.
",9311514,Leela," Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?
",3611515,Hermes," The shares were worthless and he kept asking for toilet paper.
",6411516,Mom," And now if Momcorp shareholders will cast their ballots.
",5811517,Igner," Um ... uh...  Uh, the ballot was confusing.
",4511518,Mom," How about a hand recount?
",2711519,Igner," OK.  Ow!
",1011520,Mom," The takeover of Planet Express is approved.
",4511521,Amy," This stinks!
",1411522,Lackey," Madam is outraged.
",2011523,Steve Castle," Security, I want that bunch of rowdies outta here.
",5211524,Bender," Hold on a minute!
",1911525,Scruffy," Hey! Hey!
",1111526,Mom," Momcorp will now purchase all outstanding shares of Planet Express at the current market price, which is:
",10711527,Jor-El," 107.
",611528,Bender," Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!
",3511529,Horrible Gelatinous Stockbroker," What are you solids griping about? Your shares are worth $107 apiece.
",7111530,Leela," They are? Oh, my God! I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an opinion about that capital gains tax!
",9911531,Bender," Yeah! Alright!
",1611532,Amy," I'm even richer!
",1811533,Zoidberg," Oh! I have no shares!  Wait! My sangwich! Has it also appreciated in value?  Please, oh, please!
",9811534,Hermes," You didn't even refrigerate it, you spineless lobster!
",5611535,Zoidberg," You had to drag spines into this!
",3511536,Fry,"  As vice chairman of Planet Express, I'd like to say a few words. There comes a time for every man who becomes rich and deserts his friends, when he goes back how it was. For me, that time is now.
",19811537,Fry," So I ask you, as a friend, won't you stop this deal?
",5411538,Steve Castle," Fry, I'm an 80's guy. Friendship to me means that for two bucks I'd beat you with a pool cue till you got detached retinas. The deal will go ahead as--  My bones!
",16411539,Fry," Oh, my God! His boneitis!
",2711540,Steve Castle," I was so busy being an 80's guy, I forgot to cure it.  My only regret is ... that I have ... boneitis!
",10411541,Fry," He's dead.
",1211542,Mom," Pry out his fillings, feed him to the jackals and let's get on with the sale.
",7911543,Fry," I don't think so. 'Cause, as vice chairman of the company, I gain voting control of his shares.
",9711544,Mom," Don't be a fool, you idiot!
",2911545,Fry," I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy was the greatest businessman that ever lived. And before his mysterious death, he taught me everything he knew.  But some things I had to learn myself.  I learned that money is fine but in the end what counts is people ...  ... people you love.  You can't put a price on that.  So I'm giving up control of the company ...  ... to a man of enormous experience ...  ... Professor ...  ... Hubert Farnsworth.
",44511546,Farnsworth," Oh, uh, what? I'm awake, I'm awake!
",3711547,Bender," Fry! Stop doing the right thing, you jerk!
",4411548,Leela," Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna be filthy, stinking rich!
",6511549,Zoidberg," Trust me, two out of three doesn't cut it!
",4411550,Fry," You mean you'd rather be rich than work together?
",5111551,Leela," Hell, yeah!
",1311552,Fry," In my whole life, this company was the only place I'd ever really felt at home. If being millionaires is more important to you than our--
",13911553,Bender," It is!
",811554,Fry," Friendship, then I'll sell Planet Express, for you.
",5311555,Hattie McDoogal," ""Millionaires"" nothing! The stock's only worth three kajiggers!
",6511556,Bender," Oh, come on!
",1411557,Hermes," My Jah! It's worth less now than when it was worthless!
",5711558,Fry," It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what I do! The deal is off!
",6411559,Zoidberg," Aha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor!  Oh! I'm ruined.  Why? Why?
",12111560,Fry," Look, so we're not millionaires. At least we all still get to work together.
",7811561,Bender," Shut your fat mouth!
",2211562,Fry,"  See you guys Monday!
",2311563,Morbo,"  Welcome back. Our next guest has been teaching the world to cook for over 20 years. But apparently my, uh, wife hasn't been listening.
",13711564,Linda,"  Oh, funny!
",1311565,Morbo,"  I will destroy her!  And now, extend a formulaic greeting to master chef Elzar.  So, uh, Elzar, what will you be cooking for Morbo to devour with his mighty jaws?
",16511566,Elzar,"  Morbo, I'm gonna whip you up a nice, unnameable horror from beyond, with mango chutney.
",9011567,Morbo,"  Pathetic humans, prepare to write down the recipe!
",5311568,Fry," Hey, uh, what's with all the pots and pans? You building a wife?
",6611569,Bender," Part of one. Meantime, I'm cooking up a tasty Sunday brunch for my best friends.
",8211570,Fry," Brunch. Right. I'd better warn-- tell-- warntell the others!
",6211571,Bender," Okey-dokey!
",1311572,Hermes," Ooh!
",611573,Leela," Nice!
",711574,Farnsworth," Yes, it's a perfect scale model of the universe's largest bottle. I put a tiny spaceship inside to keep it from being boring.
",12711575,Zoidberg," Oh!
",511576,Farnsworth," Get--!  For the last time, Zoidberg, look with your eyes, not with your claws.
",8011577,Fry," Brace yourselves. Bender is making us brunch.
",4711578,Zoidberg," Oh, boy!
",1011579,Farnsworth," Oh, God! My tract!
",2011580,Fry," He's so proud of his awful cooking. If we don't eat it he'll be crushed.
",7411581,Leela," Alright, don't panic. If we can get to the ship, we can fly north and hide under the polar icecaps for a few weeks.
",11711582,Fry," Hurry!
",811583,Farnsworth," Good idea!
",1211584,Zoidberg," What's the hold-up?
",2111585,Bender," Fleeing somewhere?
",2011586,Fry," With you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly.
",5811587,Bender," In that case brunch is served! Let's go! Move it out! Stop crying, Leela!
",7511588,Farnsworth," Zoidberg, are you coming?
",2711589,Zoidberg," Sure. Me.
",1111590,Farnsworth," Because I don't want you touching that thing.
",4711591,Zoidberg," I know that.  Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg!  Oh, no! Professor will hit me. But if Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts!  Ow! What? Oh!
",14611592,Bender," Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I baked you a pony.  Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove.
",15311593,Hermes," This is terrible!
",1911594,Farnsworth," Good thing I secretly installed this wormhole in the table.
",6111595,Amy," Where does the other end come out?
",3611596,Farnsworth," You know, I'm not quite sure.  Oh, dear me!
",4511597,Bender," The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things, right?
",5811598,Zoidberg," Casual hello. It's me, Zoidberg. Act naturally.  Ow! Ouch! Get off of me! Stop!
",8111599,Leela," How interesting, Dr. Zoidberg. Do go on.
",4211600,Bender," Hey, check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's that for a coincidence, Professor? With all your precious science!
",14211601,Fry,"  Man, I don't wanna hurt Bender's feelings...
",4711602,Fry," But this food actually tastes better as vomit!
",4811603,Leela," It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to get my tongue removed?
",8011604,Bender,"  And this time I mean it.
",2711605,Bender," Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. I don't have what it takes and nothing can change that.  Then it's settled! Elzar will teach me to cook!
",18211606,Elzar," Absolutely not.
",1711607,Bender," But I watch your show. You owe me!
",3611608,Elzar," I owe you nothing! For starter's, your antenna's in my crotch. Also, I hate you. Finally, you can't cook for squat.
",11711609,Bender," What was the first one again?
",3111610,Elzar," I hate you.
",1311611,Bender," I thought that was number two.
",3211612,Elzar," I knocked it up a notch. Bam!
",3111613,Zoidberg," Aw, I'll never recombobulate this ship! When the Professor finds out, he'll tear me a new cloaca.  Wait! What would the robot do?  Frame someone!
",14711614,Fry," What up?
",1011615,Fry,"  I'm walking on sunshine!  Sunshine!
",3811616,Bender,"  It's over! My dream of being a chef is deader than the cat I'm sitting on!
",7711617,Dandy Jim," Gus, old chum, let's give a friendly welcome to this new robo.
",6411618,Bender," What did you call me?
",2311619,Gus," A robo. You know? A robot-hobo.
",3311620,Bender," Oh, OK. I thought you said ""romo"".
",3611621,Dandy Jim," No offence intended, my filthy friend. In fact, why not join us and ride the space rails?
",9111622,Gus," Get ready. We's gonna jump off at that switching prism up ahead.
",6611623,Dandy Jim," We're going nearly the speed of light so, uh, roll when you land.
",6711624,Bender," Ow.
",511625,Gus," Welcome to Bumbase Alpha, the biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant.
",6811626,Bender," I've seen bigger. Oh, wait, I'm thinking of Eugene, Oregon.  Wait. A pie with hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?
",11311627,Gus," Helmut Spargle. He used to be the greatest chef ever.
",5511628,Dandy Jim," His restaurant was so high-toned, the only way to get reservations was to create a parallel universe where you already had reservations.
",13811629,Gus," Yep. I once ate there back when I what was a senator.
",5511630,Bender," Yo, Spargle. If you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?
",7411631,Spargle," Ages ago I was the host of a TV show...
",4111632,Spargle,"  Down Home Country Kitchen Mit Helmut Spargle. But one day the extreme soda company that sponsored the show decided it was too old-fashioned.
",14311633,Man #1," Spargle, you're fired! We need a chef who can attract today's younger more extreme cooking show viewer.
",10511634,Spargle," Elzar!
",811635,Elzar," Get lost, old man! Bam!
",2511636,Spargle," Mein soufflÃ©!
",1511637,Spargle," Elzar had been seduced by the dark side of cooking. Cilantro, mango salsa, raspberry vinaigrette!
",9911638,Bender," That twizzler!
",1611639,Spargle," As for me, I went temporarily insane and vound up here, making pies out of shoes.
",8311640,Bender," My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves robots. That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too.
",13111641,Spargle," Interesting. You wish to become a cook, but as a robot you have no sense of taste.
",8411642,Bender," It's so unfair! I have eight other senses, but I'd trade them all, even smission, to be able to taste.
",10411643,Spargle," You don't understand. Without the distraction of taste, your mind is free to touch the Zen of pure flavour. You could become the greatest chef ever.
",15011644,Bender," I could?
",1011645,Spargle," Yes. Just as Beethoven was a great composer because he was deaf.
",6611646,Bender," Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands.
",5511647,Spargle," Bender, hear me well. I shall train you. But first, you must forget everything you know about cooking.
",10411648,Bender," Done.
",711649,Farnsworth," That's right, Ricardo. A ship in a bottle! What's that? Well hang on, I'll look.
",8211650,Ricardo,"  Ola? Professor? QuÃ© pasa?
",2811651,Farnsworth," I've gathered you all here in the accusing parlour because one of you is a miniature ship wrecker.
",10011652,Zoidberg," I'm acting astonished.
",2411653,Farnsworth," Certain clues suggest that the culprit is none other than our own ... Philip J. Fry!
",8611654,Fry," What?
",711655,Farnsworth," Oh, it was a brilliant scheme. But you made one fatal mistake ... leaving this confession note.
",9711656,Zoidberg," Fry, you scoundrel!
",2111657,Fry," Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself.
",8711658,Farnsworth," Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials: $10.
",7811659,Fry," There you go.
",1511660,Zoidberg,"  What have I done?
",2011661,Spargle," Your training is complete, little dessert spoon. Now, just as the man who wishes to be world chess champion must win at least one game of chess, so must you serve at least one edible meal.  Succeed and I shall reveal to you the age-old secret  of perfect flavour.
",26511662,Gus," Ooh, yeah!
",1211663,Bender,"  Slop's on!
",1311664,Gus," Fine lookin' eats!
",2011665,Spargle," It is ... acceptable.
",2311666,Bender," Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. Why'd you stop eating, master?
",7311667,Spargle,"  Because ... my stomach is about to explode.
",4611668,Bender," What? My dinner killed you? Oh, man!
",3811669,Spargle,"  Oh, it hurts. But don't lose confidence. The important thing is that you defeat Elzar after I am gone.  And using this, you cannot fail.
",13911670,Bender," A diamond vial of Mrs. Dash?
",3011671,Spargle,"  No. It is the essence of pure flavour. A few drops will cause the inner perfection of any dish to blossom forth.  Oh! There goes my ... life.
",14411672,Bender," I'll avenge you, master. I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums, that I shall defeat Elzar!
",10111673,Gus," Oh, I'm not drunk, I'm mentally ill. But I likes what what you said!
",7011674,Bender," Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business!
",5611675,Elzar," Why, you--
",1211676,Bender," Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says  ""Ooh, I'm dead!""
",6511677,Elzar," Spargle, huh? What he do, bland himself to death?
",5111678,Bender," No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. Now I'm here to avenge him.
",11311679,Elzar," OK, but it seems like you're the one who killed him.
",5411680,Bender," Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of the chefs.
",8111681,Customer," Scandalous!
",1311682,Elzar," Very well. We'll meet on the ancient televised battleground of Kitchen Coliseum. Whosever meal is best will claim the title of Iron Cook.
",13911683,Bender," Iron Cook, eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% iron!  You're going down! Uh, also I had a reservation for one, under ""Dr. Bender"".
",12211684,Hiroki," Please welcome the superintendent of Kitchen Coliseum, Chairman Koji!  No robot chef has ever competed here but today one has barged his way in to challenge for the title of...
",17811685,Koji," Iron Cookuru!
",1511686,Fry,"  Yeah! You show 'em!
",2211687,Hiroki," Let's meet today's celebrity judges: Captain of the Harlem Globetrotters, Ethan Bubblegum Tate.
",9711688,Tate," Konnichiwa, brother!
",2211689,Hiroki," TV anchor-monster, Morbo.
",2711690,Morbo," Greetings, pathetic host.
",2711691,Hiroki," And a woman who ended a thousand-year galactic war with her apple dandies, Martha Stewart's head.
",9911692,Stewart," The secret is fresh pork.
",2711693,Hiroki," And now, Chairman Koji will present the theme ingredient to be used in every dish today.
",9011694,Bender,"  If it's chicken, chicken c la king; if it's fish, fish Ã  la king; if it's turkey, fish Ã  la king.
",10011695,Koji," Soylent Greuu!
",1611696,Hiroki," Soylent Green, a classic ingredient of gourmet cooking. And the battle is on.  Aki, what's Elzar making?
",10611697,Aki," Well, Hiroki-san, when I asked him, he asked what business it was of mine and conjectured that my mother was a prostitute.
",12411698,Stewart," In the English countryside many prostitutes decorate their rooms with festive gourds.
",8711699,Female Announcer #1,"  30 minutes to go.
",2011700,Hiroki," Look at Bender roll that dough!
",3311701,Tate," I've never seen such confident, powerful strokes of the ass!
",6211702,Stewart," You've never seen mine!
",2511703,Tate,"  No, I haven't!
",1711704,Female Announcer #1,"  Fifteen minutes remaining.
",2911705,Hiroki," The iron cook is bringing in his signature creation, a working pastry replica of downtown Venice.
",9911706,Man #1,"  Commemorative turkey basters. Get your commemorative turkey basters.
",7111707,Fry," Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and I've tried everything.  Oh, right. Never mind.
",8511708,Zoidberg," Oh, the guilt! The unbearable guilt!
",3811709,Female Announcer #1,"  Fifteen seconds.
",1911710,Elzar," Bam!
",611711,Female Announcer #1,"  Ten seconds.
",1511712,Bender," Master Spargle, if you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you, this is for you.
",9411713,Koji," Time uperuu!
",1411714,Hiroki," The iron cook Neptunian has gone all out to please the judges. He's even garnished the salad with $100 bills. Let's see what they think.
",13811715,Tate," Mmm. Soylent green is my kind of people!
",4211716,Morbo," Scrumptious. Morbo will store this in his sack for future digestion.
",7011717,Stewart," I'm swimming in my own soylent waste. It's a good thing.
",5811718,Hiroki," Next up, challenger Bender. A student of the legendary Helmut Spargle, Bender is some sort of wonderful mechanical man.
",12111719,Stewart," Ooh, delicious!
",1711720,Tate," This food looks kind of funky, but it tastes kind of fun-kay!
",6311721,Morbo," The challenger's ugly food has shown us that even hideous things can be sweet on the inside.
",9411722,Hiroki," And now, judgement. The winner will become the new iron cook, the loser is doomed to scrub.  Whose confection will achieve perfection? Whose foodstuff will be the good stuff?
",17611723,Koji," Challengeruu Benderuu!
",2411724,Fry," Yay!
",611725,Farnsworth,"  That's my robot! I own him!
",3011726,Bender," You honour me, Chairman Koji.
",3111727,Koji," Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.
",2711728,Bender," Chairman-san, I came here with one goal: To humiliate Elzar in a large stadium. I believe I've done that.
",10711729,Elzar," No question.
",1411730,Bender," But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen, with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser title of ""Zinc Saucier"", which I just made up. Also, it comes with double prize money.
",26211731,Zoidberg," Wait! Everyone must know: I broke the Professor's bottled ship.  And what is worse, I framed my dearest friend, Fry!  I can never repay him his ten dollars, so I must take the only honourable path. What the killing myself.  Here I go, already.  Huh?
",25111732,Koji," Oh! That sword cost 5000 dolluu!
",3411733,Zoidberg," Fry did it!
",1311734,Bender," And that's how I defeated Elzar, thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.
",6811735,Leela," Yes, we were there. And we just finished watching it again on TV.
",6711736,Farnsworth," Hmm. Let me see that vial, Bender.  Good Lord! According to the spectrolizer, Spargle's magic ingredient was ... water. Ordinary water!
",13711737,Hermes," No!
",511738,Fry," Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence. The confidence to be your best.
",8711739,Farnsworth," Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.
",7511740,Bender," The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch? Cooked with plenty of ... ""confidence""?
",12811741,Leela," I'm in!
",911742,Farnsworth," I do!
",711743,Amy," Shman! The Great Rad Spot is mega-sweet for party-boarding.
",6111744,Farnsworth," Indeed.
",911745,Amy," Any calls while I was out?
",2811746,Leela," Yeah. You got a tele-sonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago.
",7011747,Amy," My Kiffie called?  Kif?
",2511748,Kif,"  Ooh, Amy, you're back. Another hour and I would have thought about hanging up.
",8111749,Amy," Why didn't you just leave a message, sweetie?
",4711750,Kif,"  Well, um, I've left hundreds of messages with your answering machine but you never seem to get them.
",10311751,Amy,"  Bender!
",1011752,Bender," Not my fault if you don't check me!  Messages erased.
",5511753,Kif,"  Oh, dearest, this long-distance relationship is too much to bear.  When even an inch separates us, I quiver with misery. So you can imagine how I feel when it's a billion light years.
",18611754,Amy,"  Kif, don't cry, or you'll get a tummy ache.
",4611755,Zapp,"  Lieutenant, some things came off me and clogged the drain, so if you could-- Oh, ho! What's this?
",10011756,Zapp," Well, well, well! Do my eyes believe me or is that my bosom-y swan, Leela?
",7611757,Leela,"  Say again. You're breaking up!
",3311758,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! You'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind of Nigel 7.
",8611759,Scruffy," Scruffy's rollin' out a large pill!
",3711760,Amy," You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there. You could drop me off on the way.
",8811761,Farnsworth," We could but we won't! It's a spaceship, damnit, not a prom limousine!  If anyone needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome.
",11911762,Leela," This is a very long trip. So we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis to save oxygen.
",9311763,Bender,"  I don't even breathe oxygen!
",3111764,Amy,"  Here I come, Kif!
",2011765,Zapp," They jumped right out of their pants!  Oh, what now? Activate glass window.  Kif, I'm sensing a very sensual disturbance in the force. Prepare for ship-to-ship intimacy!
",17111766,Kif," Yes, sir, captain!
",2011767,Zapp," How 'bout I help you finish that dream you were having about me?
",6611768,Leela," OK. I was just at this part: Yah!
",3511769,Zapp," Uh, let's try that a little lower and a lot softer!
",5311770,Kif," Imagine you stowing away and stealing a licensed starship! Oh, it's so romantic it gives me the shivers!
",10611771,Amy," I don't care how much trouble I get in. I needed to feel my lips pressed against your lipless beak.
",10111772,Kif," Oh, Amy, I can't stand having a whole universe between us. I've been thinking a lot about this and, well, would you move in with me?
",13411773,Amy," Here? But, uh, wouldn't it be crowded?
",4011774,Kif," No, no! It's really twice the size. You can use the floor and I'll have the ceiling. See?
",9111775,Amy," Kif! You have so much creativity and niceness, but I'm not ...  ... sure if I--
",8111776,Kif," Hush! Before you answer, come thither.
",4011777,Kif," This is the Holo-Shed. It can simulate anything you desire, and nothing can hurt you. Except when it malfunctions and the holograms become real.
",14611778,Amy," Well, that probably won't happen this time.
",4511779,Kif," I wanted to show you what life would be like if we were together. Computer: Run program ""Kif 1"".
",9811780,Amy," This is so beautiful!  Spirit! Kif, that's the pony I always wanted but my parents said I had too many ponies already.
",12011781,Kif," Yes, I programmed it in for you. 4 million lines of BASIC! And if this isn't the life you want, how 'bout this? Run program ""Kif 2"".
",13411782,Amy," Oh, Kif!
",1011783,Kif," We could live here at the shore of the Tranquilibrius Sea in a timeshare. And I would pluck the moon from the sky just to see you smile.  Almost got it. It seems to be ... sort of ... stuck!  I love you!  Run program ""Kif://3"".
",22911784,Amy," This isn't bad. My aunt had a place like this.
",4811785,Kif," Amy, we could live in a bus station bathroom for all I care. As long as we're together, it'll feel like a castle to me.
",12111786,Amy," Kif, I'd love to live with you ... someday. But before then there's still lots I wanna do on my own.  What was that?
",11811787,Kif," Oh, dear. I fear the Holo-Shed might be broken again. Well, as long as we don't cross paths with Attila the--
",11111788,Amy," Look! Spirit!
",1511789,Kif," And there's Professor Moriarty, Jack the Ripper, Evil Lincoln!
",6411790,Moriarty," Right-oh, gents, it's another simulation gone mad, so murder and mayhem, standard procedure!
",9411791,Jack the Ripper," Rampage!
",1011792,Evil Lincoln,"  Real holographic-simulated Evil Lincoln is back!
",5111793,Kif," The Holo-Shed's on the fritz again! The characters turned real!
",6511794,Zapp," Damn. The last time that happened I got slapped with three paternity suits.  Listen up, history's greatest villains...  Get back into the Holo-Shed before I start blasting!
",17411795,Attila the Hun," Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
",7711796,Zapp," Spare me your space-age techno-babble, Attila the Hun!
",5611797,Bender," Hey!
",611798,Amy," Kif! Hold on!
",1511799,Kif," I totally want to!
",2011800,Leela," Grab on!
",1011801,Fry," Over here!
",1211802,Kif," Please hold me!
",1711803,Bender," Have a good one!  Oh, man!
",2811804,Zapp," After all that I could use some relaxation. I'll be in the Holo-Shed.
",7111805,McGee," Well, except for a few broken bones, some internal haemorrhaging and a partially barfed-up heart, everyone appears fine.  Oh, and Kif is pregnant.
",14811806,Kif," Oh, joy!
",1011807,Kif," Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant!
",4011808,Amy," Yes it's ... great. A great miracle.
",3811809,Leela," And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?
",8111810,Bender," Yeah, what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, it's something else! Lemme at 'im!  Come over here, Kif! You--
",14911811,Zapp," Look, I'm sure we're all a little unclear on how anyone gets pregnant. So, Kif, pray explain. And don't spare the dirty words where appropriate.
",14611812,Kif," Well, it's quite simple really. When one of my species experiences deep feelings of love we enter a so-called ""receptive state"".
",13011813,Zapp," You disgust me! Go on.
",2411814,Kif," At that point, our skin becomes a semi-permeable membrane, which allows the passage of genetic material. I held Amy's hand and voilÃ .
",13511815,Bender," Well, OK. But that better be all there is!
",4411816,Kif," Oh, Amy! You'll be a mother!
",3011817,Kif," What a wondrous affirmation of our love. And all from the touch of your hand.
",7911818,Fry," Dude, hold up. Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?
",6011819,Evil Lincoln," Indeed.
",911820,Fry," Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?
",6811821,Amy," Hey, yeah! I mean ... what about that, Kif?
",4511822,Kif," Well, I suppose I might have gotten pregnant that way. Or even from a toilet seat. Though that's impossible since I have a private washroom.
",14211823,Zapp," Ah, my home away from home. By the way, Kif, your flush seemed to be set on stun, not kill.
",9311824,Amy," Look, Kif, I probably am the mother. Although maybe I'm not. Of course, I hope I am. But just in case I'm not, maybe we should have a test.
",14111825,Bender," A test! I demand a test!
",2611826,Farnsworth," Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross-species genetic analyser. But I guess I showed myself! Subjects, please enter the chamber.  Now to take a DNA sample.  When I pull this switch, the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM, separating out everyone who isn't the mother-- Father-- Whatever!
",30311827,Bender," Faster! Faster!
",1711828,Farnsworth," Good. Fry's ejection indicates that he is not the man-mom.  Nor is Captain Brannigan.
",8711829,Kif," Oh, thank you, merciful God!
",3011830,Farnsworth," Zoidberg? What the hell were you doing in there?
",5011831,Zoidberg," That's where I live. I have no home.
",3811832,Kif," Amy? But that means--
",2311833,Kif," Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand. That explains the poster in hygiene class: ""No Glove, No Love"".
",13111834,Leela," Wow, this is all so confusing.
",3211835,Zapp," Leela! How could you? Our love has had to endure your constant hatred, and now this?  Stop testing our love!
",11011836,Kif," Please, Captain. I thank Leela for the DNA she gave me but, in my species, the true parent is the one who inspired the initial feeling of love. We call that person the ""smizmar"". And my smizmar is Amy.
",20311837,Zapp," So the toilet seat is like the uncle or something?
",5211838,Leela," Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.
",3811839,Amy," That's OK. At least Kif's baby shower should be fun. I'd better put it on my calendar.  Thursday: Baby shower, enter.  Might as well plan for my new life while I'm at it. Set ""Motherhood Mode"".
",19511840,Leela," To motherhood.
",1611841,Bender," Zoidberg?
",1111842,Fry," You know, my face was stuck in a pizza.
",4111843,Amy," Mom, Dad, I know this is weird but--
",3811844,Mrs. Wong," Yeah, yeah. We don't care how squishy alien get pregnant. All we care is that we have grandchild now.
",10311845,Kif," You're very open-minded, Mrs. Wong.
",3711846,Leo," Hey! You call her ""Grandma"" now!
",3411847,Mrs. Wong," Call me Grandma like crazy! All the time!
",4311848,Fry," Check it out, y'all. Everyone we invited is here.
",5111849,Zoidberg," Also Zoidberg!
",1611850,Fry," So let's open the gifts.
",2611851,Bender," Alright!
",1011852,Kif," I can't wait! Let's start with this one, from Bender.
",5511853,Bender," It's my booties from when I was a kid.
",4011854,Amy," Uh, they're already bronzed.
",3011855,Bender," They are bronze.
",1811856,Kif," And this one's from Leela. Oh, I just love the bow! I wonder what it is!
",7411857,Zapp," Yes, I wonder what we got you.
",3211858,Kif," It's a basket! F-For picnics?
",3111859,Leela," It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the orphanarium.
",8111860,Hermes," You could use it for picnics.
",3111861,Mrs. Wong," Here, Amy. We get this one for you.
",3711862,Amy," Is it a new party board?
",2611863,Mrs. Wong," It's a board alright! An ironing board.
",4111864,Leo," We had your old party board converted now that you not be partying anymore.
",7711865,Amy," You-You trashed my party board?
",3311866,Mrs. Wong," Damn right! Now you're a mom, the only surfing you do is under a big wave of responsibility.
",9411867,Kif," Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life! You all brought such wonderful gifts. But the greatest gift--
",10711868,Bender," Mine!
",711869,Kif," Is the bond I share with my smizmar, Amy. For soon, the quivering mass of life within me will depend on us both.  Even now, I can sense it feeding, squirming, searching, questing. And shortly, it will rend my loins in twain, burst forth and pull us down, down, down into the deep, dark waters of commitment.
",30911870,Zoidberg," That's so beautiful!
",2211871,Amy,"  Yes, it's, it's--  No! I can't do this!
",4211872,Bender," Oh, my God!
",1311873,Kif," Oh, how could Amy leave me? When will women learn to take responsibility for the children they've helped create?  The quickening! My time is near. I must return to my homeworld to perform the ancient birthing rites.
",21711874,Scruffy," Lemme know how that turns out.
",3211875,Kif," I must now embark on a perilous journey to give birth in precisely the same swamp in which I was born.
",10411876,Leela," If it's so dangerous, I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA.
",7711877,Kif," No, Leela. Tradition demands that I make this journey with my smizmar. And since Amy isn't, here I must go it alone. Farewell, for we may never meet again.
",15711878,Kif," My scrapes feel a little better now.
",3811879,Bender," Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!
",6511880,Kif," It's a poisonous froad! No one move.
",3811881,Bender," I'm back, baby!
",1711882,Kif," Behold! The sacred ancestral birthing grounds of my family.
",6111883,Zapp," Smells like a jockstrap!
",2611884,Grand Midwife," I am the Grand Midwife.
",2511885,Fry," Hi!
",511886,Kif," I am Kif, of the clan Kroker, come to bear my young.
",5411887,Grand Midwife," Then let the Tea of New Life be brewed.  As it is writ, ""and both shall lift the jug together"". Where is your smizmar?
",12011888,Kif," She's not with me.
",2011889,Grand Midwife," Oh, the sorrow. Oh, the shame. I'm sorry, I'm probably just making you feel worse.
",8411890,Kif," As long as Amy is with me in my heart I will have the strength of two.  Apparently Amy hasn't been working out much lately.
",12511891,Grand Midwife," As the tea boils, please join hands with your beloved smizmar.  Oh, right, sorry. But I memorised the ceremony by rote and it mentions her a lot.
",14711892,Kif," I'll try to endure.
",2111893,Grand Midwife," Good, 'cause I'm not changing it. Now turn ye to and gaze deeply into each other's eyes.
",9011894,Bender," What are you looking at?
",2611895,Grand Midwife," May the love I sense between you at this moment remain with you both through all your days.  The Tea of New Life is ready. Let those whose love created this life speak each other's names, then drink.
",20111896,Kif,"  Amy.
",711897,Amy,"  Kif!
",711898,Kif," Amy! Is it you or have I gone crazy with loneliness?
",5411899,Bender," Both.
",711900,Amy," I still don't know if I'm ready for this but I do know I love you. And I wanna be here beside you.
",10011901,Grand Midwife," Great! Now I lost my place! I'm starting over!
",4811902,Kif," Oh, no time! It has begun!  Oh, my!
",3711903,Bender," Neat!
",711904,Amy," You can do it, Kif!
",2111905,Kif," Whoa, Nellie!
",1511906,Bender," Oh, man!
",1011907,Kif," Amy, my love, tell me: Are they making it to the water?
",5711908,Leela," Amy!
",611909,Amy," Shoo! Stay away from my babies!
",3311910,Grand Midwife," The birthing is complete!
",2711911,Bender," Alright!
",1011912,Kif," Oh, thank goodness!
",2111913,Grand Midwife," I will now take my leave. I live here so I won't actually be going anywhere, but you don't have to talk to me anymore.
",12011914,Fry," Congratulations!
",1811915,Zapp," Nice work!
",1211916,Bender," Way to go, squishy!
",2111917,Leela," There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.
",6111918,Fry," That's birth for you.
",2311919,Kif," Well, we've given them a great start, Amy. And in 20 years they'll sprout legs and crawl back onto land as children.
",11811920,Amy," I'll be ready then.
",2111921,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up?
",7211922,Fry," Sure. We talk about it all the time.
",3811923,Leela," Really?
",911924,Fry," No. Burn!
",1111925,Farnsworth," Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium has named Leela ""Orphan of the Year"".
",8411926,Amy," Yee-ha!
",911927,Bender," Alright!
",1011928,Amy," Your parents must be so proud. Oops! Sorry.
",4511929,Farnsworth," And the good news keeps on coming. Behold my latest invention.
",6411930,Bender," Neat!
",711931,Farnsworth," Ta-da! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose you can wear over your regular non-glowing nose. Observe.
",9511932,Amy," Whoa, clool!
",1411933,Bender," Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark.
",4611934,Bender,"  Where'd it go?
",1711935,Amy," Hey, Professor, what's all this scloop, glorking out of the machine?
",7011936,Farnsworth," That? It's, uh ... nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything, you're a suspicious moron.
",9811937,Hermes," It looks like toxic waste.  And it smells like toxic waste.
",6111938,Fry," What does it taste like?
",2611939,Hermes," Delicious fig pudding! Ooh, that's good! But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste.
",8411940,Farnsworth," Alright, alright, so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have to make a federal case out of it.
",11711941,Hermes," I'm afraid I do.  I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly or bribe me. Either way it'll cost $500.
",10911942,Bender," 500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for $499 and 100 cents.
",10211943,Farnsworth," Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards?
",8611944,Bender," Let's find out.
",1711945,Bender," Alright, environment, you've met your match!
",4611946,Smitty," Hey, get back in the sewer, weird-y. No mutants on the surface.
",6511947,Vyolet," But he ruined my wedding dress.
",3311948,Bender," Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
",8811949,Vogel," Y'know, it's not easy being an orphan -- not if I have anything to do with it.  But today's honouree, Turanga Leela, has really made something of herself.  I'll never forget the night that cute little alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep. Because I have a photographic memory and I remember every night!
",30911950,Vogel," What the--? An alien language? I guess you're an alien. What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha--  Well, come on in.
",11511951,Vogel," From those humble beginnings, Leela went on to become a county-certified starship captain. And so it is my pleasure today to nail her picture alongside those of our most distinguished alumni.
",19311952,Leela," Thank you very much. Like many of you, I never knew my parents...
",6711953,Vogel,"  Give me a--
",1411954,Leela," I don't know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side--
",11611955,Vogel," There we are. Picture's up.
",2911956,Bender,"  It's crooked!
",1611957,Leela," In the end though, it doesn't matter who my parents were. All that matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength to make it on my own, just like all of you kids here today.
",21211958,Kids,"  Leela! Leela! Leela!
",2311959,Nina," Look at me! I'm Leela!
",2411960,Albert," Nuh-uh! 'Cause I'm double Leela!
",3411961,Vogel," That's it, Albert, no more espresso for you.
",4611962,Photographer #1," Mind if I get a picture of you with your picture for the news, ma'am?
",7111963,Leela," Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!
",6011964,Fry," If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying.
",5711965,Leela,"  It's OK, Fry. I'm fine. I won an award today.
",4811966,Fry," Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, let's go for a walk.
",9411967,Leela," I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
",12711968,Fry," Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
",3711969,Leela," I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me.
",16511970,Fry," Then today's your lucky day, because I happen to be a holding, stroking, lovin' machine! Also spankin'.
",10511971,Leela," That's not even close to what I had in mind.
",4611972,Fry," Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you.
",5711973,Leela," I know.  Sometimes, when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me.
",19211974,Fry," Yo, yo, Bezender! What up?
",2811975,Bender," My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3.
",8711976,Leela," Bender! Cut it out! First of all, the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!
",13611977,Bender," Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact. Namely, I'm up here and they are safely down--
",13511978,Bender,"  What did I do to deserve this?
",3311979,Dwayne," Behold, our once beautiful mutagenic sewage lake.
",5111980,Vyolet," The radioactive waste you dumped in it has made it bright enough to see how ugly we really are.
",9711981,Dwayne," Oh, man!
",1011982,Raoul," As if our lives weren't miserable enough already!
",5111983,Leg Mutant #1," Tell me about it!
",1911984,Raoul," Let the punishment commence!
",3011985,Leela," Punishment?
",1311986,Fry," No fair!
",1011987,Bender," Bender's innocent!
",2011988,Raoul," The instant you touch these mutatious waters, your DNA will be forever altered, turning you into horrible mutants like us. Especially him!  Allow me to demonstrate!
",16611989,Fry," It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.
",6411990,Raoul," Submerge the prisoners.
",2511991,Bender," Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?
",5011992,Dwayne," We're gonna beat you afterwards.
",3411993,Mutant #1s,"  Mutate! Mutate! Mutate! ...
",3011994,Hooded Figure #1,"  Turanga Leela!
",1711995,Leela," Who said that? How do you know my real name?
",4611996,Bender," Whee!
",711997,Raoul," What are you doing? Stop it!
",3011998,Fry," What happened?
",1611999,Leela," I don't know. I think I saved us somehow.
",4312000,Raoul,"  Go after them! The waters can't mutate us mutants!
",5312001,Raoul," They went this way!
",2112002,Bender," Quick! In there!
",1812003,Dwayne," Kill! Kill! Kill!
",1912004,Leela," Great Cheech's ghost!
",2312005,Bender," What's this junk?
",1912006,Leela," It looks like ... a timeline of my whole life.
",4812007,Fry," That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.
",6212008,Leela," And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.
",6812009,Bender," And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.
",4912010,Leela," It's like some kind of weird Leela museum ... and I'm the Leela!
",6612011,Fry,"  Dude! Over here!
",1912012,Leela," It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary pages. And my screenplay!
",11012013,Fry," And also, for some reason, the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings.
",8112014,Leela,"  Oh, I'm scared!  My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant!
",8112015,Vyolet,"  They must be in here.
",2412016,Raoul,"  Yeah, after them.
",2012017,Bender," And then Bender ran!
",2212018,Fry," Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!
",5412019,Dwayne," Got you!
",1012020,Leg Mutant #1," Take this!
",1212021,Fry," Ow!
",512022,Raoul," This time I'm calling for the death penalty. And not just because I'm running for re-election as Supreme Mutant.
",11412023,Mutant #1s,"  Four more years! Four more years!
",3612024,Raoul," Oh, very well.  Your attention. Instead of being tortured to death, the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to return.
",15312025,Bender,"  Oh, cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?
",7312026,Leela," Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?
",5412027,Bender," Yeah! What are you chicken?
",2912028,Fry,"  Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!
",6012029,Raoul," They'll need transportation to the surface. Bring in the airship.
",6712030,Bender," Ew!
",512031,Raoul," We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macy's parade balloons. Underdog's groin, Bart Simpson's left ear and right shin, Garfield's owner Jon's forehead.
",16912032,Mutant #1 #1," Fire up the sewer gas!
",2412033,Mutant #1 #2," Move it, you ugly normals!
",2812034,Bender," Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!
",4712035,Fry,"  Come on, Leela. You can do it!
",3312036,Bender,"  Hurry! We're missing our bus!
",3212037,Fry,"  Whoa! What are you doing?
",2812038,Bender,"  I'm gettin' on the bus!
",2612039,Leela,"  Don't worry! I'll be fine!   They know something about me and I've got to find out what.  The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?
",14212040,Octopus," It worked for me. I used to be a little blonde girl named Virginia.
",6912041,Leela," Eurgh!  Who the hell are you?
",3112042,Hooded Figure #1," No one. And watch your language, young lady!
",4612043,Mutant #1 #2," Stop right there! I don't want to hurt you.  I didn't want you to hurt me either!
",8312044,Fry," Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her mysterious past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?
",13112045,Vogel," Nah. Nothing that wouldn't be a waste of your time.
",5312046,Fry," That's impossible because my time is worthless!
",4912047,Vogel," Huh. Well then there is one thing.  It's the note I found with Leela the day she was abandoned. But it's written in Alienese, so no one on Earth can translate it. Not even Brainzilla.
",18512048,Fry," Hand it over.
",1512049,Vogel," Sure.  I just wish I could be more helpful. Would you like some dirt on any other orphans?
",9212050,Fry," Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later.
",8012051,Fry," Can you translate it?
",2312052,Farnsworth," Of course. But only into Beta Crypt 3, a language so complex there's even less chance of understanding it.
",10812053,Fry," I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy.
",7512054,Farnsworth," Very well.
",1212055,Fry," Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?
",4712056,Farnsworth," It can do other things. Why shouldn't it?  Of course, even if it is possible to analyse the message, there's no way of knowing how long it would take. It could take an hour or it could take a hundred million years.
",21612057,Fry," Is it done?
",1312058,Farnsworth," Certainly not. Two dings means it's done.  But not like that. Slightly more rapid.
",8412059,Leela," Where did they go?
",2012060,Bender," Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy.
",8512061,Leela," Ew!
",512062,Farnsworth," That's it! It's done!  I can't believe it! My mind is boggling. The analysis of the note is printing out now.
",11112063,Doctor," It's a girl.
",1412064,Mother," My God! She's beautiful. No extra anythings.
",4612065,Father," Good people skills!
",2112066,Mother," She's completely perfect!
",2712067,Doctor," In my professional opinion as an ear, ear, ear, nose and throat doctor, she is the least-mutated mutant ever born.
",11612068,Father," And yet she's cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant. Like all of us. Especially him!
",10312069,Leg Mutant #1," It's true!
",1212070,Mother," Maybe we can do better for her.
",3312071,Father," I made this bracelet so that in some small way we'll always be with you, even when it doesn't seem like it. During your entire life, for example.
",14712072,Mother," You won't pass for human, cutie. But if my PhD in exo-linguistics is worth diddly-poop, this note should convince them you're an alien.  And that'll be enough to give you a real life.
",18512073,Father," She'll never know we're her parents.
",3812074,Mother," That's our gift to her. Better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth of her origin.
",10012075,Father," I'm with you.
",1512076,Vogel," What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha--  Well, come on in.
",5912077,Hooded Figure #1," Keep quiet so she doesn't hear us.
",3612078,Hooded Figure #2," What's there to talk about?
",2912079,Hooded Figure #1," Sh!
",512080,Leela," Hands up!  Tentacles too!
",2712081,Hooded Figure #1," Don't say anything stupid, Morris.
",3612082,Leela," What is all this?  Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show? Do you believe I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dalai Lama? Stop me if I guess it!
",16512083,Hooded Figure #2," Well, actually, there--
",2512084,Hooded Figure #1," Morris! Sh!
",1312085,Leela,"  And what about this  How did you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents? You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!
",27812086,Hooded Figure #2,"  Yes. We killed them.
",2312087,Hooded Figure #1," You guessed the truth.
",2412088,Leela," Because of you I'll never know my parents. I'll kill you!
",5912089,Hooded Figure #1," That would be best.
",2112090,Fry," Stop!  Thanks, Bender! Don't do it, Leela!
",4412091,Leela," They killed my parents!
",2512092,Fry," Close.
",812093,Leela," They are my parents.
",2212094,Munda," Yes.
",612095,Fry," I had the Professor analyse the Alienese letter that was found with you.
",7412096,Leela," What does it say?
",1912097,Fry," I 'unno. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper. A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers.
",12612098,Munda," It says, ""Your parents love you very much"".
",4512099,Morris," We still do.
",1412100,Leela," So, I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant.
",3712101,Morris," We never wanted you to know. You deserved a better life.
",5812102,Munda," You must despise us.
",2212103,Leela,"  You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you.  This is the happiest moment of my life.
",9912104,Bender," Aw!
",512105,Bender," You are one narrow minded spaceship, Planet Express Ship.
",5912106,Ship," Whoa, whoa! Why should my tax money pay for art I find offensive?
",6712107,Bender," Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
",7512108,Ship," Oh, it's filthy! Why not create a national endowment for strip clubs while we're at it?
",8912109,Bender," Why not, indeed?
",1812110,Leela," Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm gonna come back there and change your opinions manually.
",9412111,Bender," Fine! I'll be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks.
",6712112,Ship,"  Oops! Sorry!
",1512113,Bender," Ah, that Ship is so white bread!
",3412114,Hermes," People, it's Valentine's Day next week, so your beloved company has gotten you all new uniforms.
",9812115,Amy," Clool!
",812116,Zoidberg," Clothing, delicious clothing!
",3112117,Farnsworth," We'll need to look our best if we're to get the account of our new potential customer, Romanticorp.
",10112118,Amy," Romanticorp? Are they a corporation that makes romantic stuff?
",6412119,Hermes," Very good, Amy!
",1712120,Farnsworth," Everyone suit up. We're off to the most romantic city on Earth!
",6512121,Farnsworth," Remember, we've got to show these people we're not bitter husks of human beings who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela, you'll have to do some acting.
",18112122,Leela," Check!
",812123,Sheldon," Welcome. Oh, I'm just so excited!  I'm Sheldon, and this is my chief financial officer, Gwen.
",9512124,Gwen," For 30 years we've shared the adventure of managing Romanticorp.
",6612125,Sheldon," Not to mention the adventure of marriage.
",4312126,Leela," Oh, you have got to be kidding!  Ow! I-I mean, ""Aww! That's so sweet!""  Ow! I mean, ""Aww dat's show shweet!""
",11012127,Farnsworth," You know, romance is an important part of our work too. Uh, right, everyone?
",7812128,Leela," Yeah, sure.
",1312129,Bender,"  Oh, sure.
",1212130,Sheldon," Do any of you collect Lovey Bears?
",3612131,Amy," I do! Kif's given me dozens. Is it true what the ad says? That you kiss them together out of blanket cloth and magic buttons?
",12712132,Gwen," No.
",512133,Sheldon," It's actually cheaper to genetically engineer real ones.  They frolic in the Lovey Forest until their first birthday. Then we choose the cuddly-uddliest ones and stuff them full of fire-retardant love fluff!
",20912134,Amy," So cute!
",1012135,Gwen," Knowing which pickup lines fizzle and which ones sizzle keeps us on the cutting edge of flirtation technology.
",11212136,Frame #1," Is heaven missing an angel? 'Cause you've got nice cans!
",5812137,Frame #2," My two favourite things are commitment and changing myself.
",6112138,Leela," Does that dummy have a brother?
",3312139,Sheldon," And now, friends and lovers, we come to the heart of our operation. Pun definitely intended!
",9412140,Hermes," Impressive!
",1312141,Gwen," My family has been making these hearts since the 1900s. Tastes may have changed but our secret recipe sure hasn't.
",11612142,Fry," Whoa! Letters like ""U"" and ""R"" can mean words like ""You"" and ""Are"". Here, Leela, ""U-R-2 Cute"".
",9612143,Leela," Perhaps. What's your point?
",2912144,Fry," I've never been able to put into words how I feel about you. But somewhere among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna find them.
",16612145,Farnsworth," So, do we have the contract?
",3012146,Farnsworth," With that big new Romanticorp contract, I've been able to make those government-mandated upgrades you've all been suing me about.
",13112147,Leela," Ooh, look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor.
",6412148,Fry," And you got a cage for the lion!
",3412149,Bender," Hey, who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock, it's college rock!
",8912150,Farnsworth," Oh, it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I installed.
",8112151,Ship," Yeah, it was me. It's a cute song.
",3612152,Bender," Listen, Ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!
",7612153,Farnsworth," It even comes with an adjustable voice.
",4112154,Ship,"  We each get one of the four buttons.  Remember, Bender? That was the deal.
",7712155,Bender," What? Did you just say--
",2612156,Ship," If you don't like the stations you could just ... play with my buttons till you find something we both enjoy.  Oh, gosh! That came out all wrong!
",14712157,Bender," Too late, baby, you said it! So, what'll it be? My place ... or you?
",7012158,Fry," Before we deliver these hearts, I'm gonna find the one that sums up my feelings for you.  ""I Love You."" Hmm, too conventional. ""You're My Man."" Ooh, so close!
",16012159,Leela," I'm not impressed by a guy's message, Fry, I'm impressed by the guy. Or not.
",7812160,Fry," Whoa!
",712161,Leela," What was that?
",1612162,Fry," Maybe we hit a space cow.
",2712163,Bender," Coochie, coochie!
",1912164,Ship,"  Stop it! You're mussing up my trajectory!
",4412165,Bender," You know you love it, sugar-engine!
",3712166,Ship,"  No!
",612167,Leela," Bender!  What's going on in here?  Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame.
",7512168,Ship," It's not what it looks like. Uh, Bender was just helping me ... zip up my turbine.
",8412169,Fry," Wow, Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both items but-- How can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady. And living inside her. And she'd be all like--
",20312170,Bender," Fry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big 400-ton booty.
",9712171,Leela," Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B.
",14412172,Bender," That's what makes it so nasty!
",3212173,Leela," Still, given the chance, I'd give in to urges far more shocking.
",6612174,Bender," Â : Daisy, Daisy,
Give me your answer do,
",4212175,Bender," I'm half crazy,
All for the love of you,
It won't be a stylish marriage,
",7412176,Bender," I can't afford a carriage,
",2812177,Bender," But you'll look sweet,
Upon the seat,
Of a bicycle built for two.
",6712178,Bender," Well, I'm sick of her.
",2412179,Fry," The ship? But you just started dating.
",4012180,Bender," With my mighty robot powers, I can get sick of things much quicker than you humans.
",8512181,Leela," Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy.
",8612182,Bender," In due time, Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side.
",8512183,Fry," You have much to teach us.
",2812184,Leela," Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust?
",8812185,Bender," Oh, wait, you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.
",5312186,Fembot #1 #1," What's it like being a lawyer for the Mayor's office and also the world's strongest millionaire?
",9812187,Bender," Well, baby, for starters you need to be honest all the time!
",6212188,Elzar," Good evening, Bender. And to your lady friends may I say, ""Bam""!
",6612189,Fembot #1 #2," You know Elzar?
",1712190,Ship," Hm.
",512191,Fry," Huh?  Planet Express Ship? Is that you?
",4112192,Ship," Oh. Hi, Fry. Is Bender home?
",3012193,Fry," Uh, no. Um, I think he's at his parents'.
",4312194,Ship," Oh, I see. He didn't fly there in another spaceship did he?
",6112195,Fry," Bender? No! He's an old-fashioned one-spaceship robot. Look, I'll tell him you stopped by, K?
",9512196,Ship," OK.  Oh. Hi, Fry. Is he home now?
",3512197,Ship," Of all the zoos we've been to today, I like this one the best. Bender, which is your favourite nocturnal rat?
",11112198,Bender," Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive.
",3812199,Ship," Oh, honey, look! The tapirs!  It says here the babies lose their pyjama-like coat after their first year. Isn't that interesting, honey?
",13812200,Bender," Yep. Mind-numbingly interesting. Ooh!
",3912201,Ship," Bender! Are you looking at other women?
",4112202,Bender," No, baby, never!
",1812203,Ship," Bender, don't lie! I saw you at Elzar's with those two ladies of the evening. Explain that!
",9312204,Bender," OK, I like a challenge.  No ... no.  Ah, I got it! I'm going to be completely honest with you, Planet Express Ship. Those women you saw me with ... were my accountants.
",17012205,Ship," Your accountants? Oh, I would dearly love to believe that were true. So I do.
",7912206,Bender," Phew!
",712207,Ship," I'm gonna go home and get dinner started.
",4312208,Liu," Who are you talking to?
",2512209,Bender," No one, baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender.
",5312210,Liu," I love you--
",1412211,Leela," Planet Express Ship, is something wrong?
",4212212,Ship," Oh, it's Bender. He's acting so strange lately.  Do you think he's going to ask me to marry him?
",9812213,Leela," Uh, no.
",912214,Ship," Oh, somebody knows something she's not telling!
",4912215,Leela," Look, I'm not saying Bender's not great but have you ever considered that maybe he's, y'know, not that great?
",11112216,Ship," You're just jealous. No one loves you cause you're tiny and you're made of meat.
",8212217,Leela," Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids?
",6512218,Ship," Sorry, Captain Leela. I guess I'm just having one of those manic Mondays!
",7512219,Lrrr," This is ancient Earth's most foolish program. Why does Ross, the largest friend, not simply eat the other five?
",11312220,Ndnd," Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps.
",4212221,Guard #1," Exalted leaders, the Earth messengers have arrived bearing a peace offering from their weak and fearful government.
",11712222,Lrrr," Oh, very well. This is a Joey-heavy episode anyway.  I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
",9612223,Leela,"  Esteemed potentates of Omicron Persei 8, please accept these 20 billion candy hearts as proof that Earth loves you this much!
",12812224,Lrrr," These candies are choky and unpleasant!
",4112225,Ndnd," And what is this emotion you humans call ""wuv""?
",4912226,Lrrr," Surely it says ""love""?
",2412227,Ndnd," No, ""wuv"". With an Earth ""W"". Behold!
",3912228,Lrrr,"  This concept of ""wuv"" confuses and infuriates us!
",5212229,Fry," Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum yarnell!
",4912230,Leela," Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets.
",7712231,Bender," Uh, look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time, but, well, I really like you and whatever, but, I think we should just be friends.
",14812232,Ship,"  Nooo!
",812233,Bender," So we're cool?
",1612234,Leela," Well, it was a spectacular battle but there doesn't seem to be any permanent damage.
",8612235,Ship,"  No damage? What about my feelings?
",3712236,Leela," Aw, calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are.
",7212237,Bender,"  Bender is great, oh, Bender is great. Bender, Bender, Bender!
",6412238,Fry," You could've have picked a better time to dump the ship, Bender!
",6612239,Bender," Ah, the moment seemed right. Call me old-fashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating.
",11112240,Leela," I know. I know. Look, Ship, if there's one thing I learned from my mutual break-up with Sean that was totally mutual, it's that happiness can only come from within you.
",17012241,Ship,"  But Bender is within me! There must be some way to make him love me again.
",7712242,Leela," Trust me. You can't change men anymore than you can change the laws of time and space.
",8812243,Ship," That is so true.  I may not be able to change the laws of time and space, but I know something that can.
",10612244,Leela," Um, sweetie? You see that giant quasar we're heading into? You might wanna scooch a few parsecs to the left.
",11012245,Ship,"  I'm afraid I can't do that, Leela.
",3712246,Fry," What's happening? Space cow?
",3012247,Leela," The ship's just taking the break-up a little hard.  She's nuts!
",6512248,Ship," In a few moments, the power of 10 billion black holes will smush me and Bender together into a beautiful eternal quantum singularity.
",13512249,Bender," Uh, you don't need to kill us, Planet Express Ship ... because ... I love you. Oh, yeah, baby! I feel like doing stuff for you and stuff.
",13912250,Ship," Hmm. I don't believe you. If you really wanted to be with me, you'd merge your programming with mine.
",10312251,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! All my friends who've done that said that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship.
",13112252,Leela," Look, I don't know if you want my opinion--
",4512253,Ship," Leela, Bender and I really need to be alone, so I'm turning off the oxygen.
",7712254,Leela," Now look, missy! If you don't turn around now, I'm going to have to shut down your brain.
",9112255,Ship," Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela.
",4112256,Fry," Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!
",3612257,Ship," Maybe not. But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction?
",6812258,Bender," Float for your lives!
",2312259,Leela," This is the one place she can't hear us. Everyone just pretend to shower.
",7512260,Fry," Same as everyday, got it.
",2712261,Leela," Now, here's the plan.
",2312262,Ship," Oh, if only I could read lips.
",3212263,Leela," Comprendez, Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your programming with hers while I shut down her brain.
",11212264,Bender," It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!
",13512265,Leela," I'm willing to take that risk.
",3212266,Bender," Hey, pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with you would be extremely bearable.
",10612267,Ship," You really mean it?
",2112268,Bender," Uh...  Yes!
",1312269,Bender," Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!
",5012270,Ship," Come closer, Bender. Let's become one!
",4012271,Bender," I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en!
",6412272,Leela," OK, Bender has her distracted. Now I can shut down her brain by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix.  I can't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face.
",16612273,Fry," I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it.
",6712274,Leela," Fat chance.
",1312275,Fry," Yeah, I know  Ooh! How 'bout this one?
",4012276,Leela," Give it up, Fry! I've got to pop these tops in a precise order.
",6512277,Leela," Halfway there. The ship should be getting a bit less rational now.
",6812278,Ship," Want ... engulf ... Bender!
",2912279,Leela," Only a few more.  Hey! I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more reason we must survive this.
",10212280,Fry," Um, Leela?
",1212281,Leela," Fry! I'll read your candy later, when we're not dead!  What was that?
",7112282,Fry,"  Oh, nothing.
",1512283,Ship," We're gonna love being each other, you sexy ion!
",5012284,Bender,"  Nooo!
",812285,Leela," Last one!
",1112286,Leela," It worked! Gravity normal, air returning. Terror replaced by cautious optimism! We did it, Fry!  Fry?  You gave me your oxygen? Oh, no! Breathe, Fry! Breathe!   You leave me breathless.   Happy Valentine's Day, Fry.
",21712287,Fry,"  Happy Valentine's day.
",2512288,Fry," Bender! Are you OK?
",2112289,Bender," Aw, what crazy thing am I going to date next?
",4712290,Leela," Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your consciousness separate from hers.
",9112291,Bender," Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle.  A cuddly baby tapir!  And that's why I love him!
",10312292,Fry," Well, I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts.
",6212293,Leela," Nah, I've got a lazier idea.
",3012294,Zoidberg,"  As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar, a wondrous thing happened, why not. They vaporised into a mystical love radiation that spread across the universe, destroying many, many planets, including two gangster planets and a cowboy world. But one planet was at exactly the right distance to see the romantic rays, but not be destroyed by them: Earth. So all over the world, couples stood together in joy. And me, Zoidberg! And no one could have been happier unless it would have also been Valentine's Day. What? It was? Hooray!
",53812295,SewerCom Operator,"   Your call is being  connected  by SewerCom. Reach out and touch the sewers.
",7912296,Munda,"  Look, Morris, it's Leela calling.
",3612297,Leela," Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Ready for your big trip to the surface?
",5912298,Morris,"  We're excited, honey, but we don't wanna embarrass you. I mean, your mother and I are basically monsters.
",10812299,Leela," Dad, relax. You are being so mutant!
",3812300,Munda,"  I found this adorable little bag to wear over my head.  And it was on sale!
",7812301,Leela," No one's wearing anything adorable over their head. Now listen, I could never, ever be ashamed of my parents. I'll see you this weekend.
",13812302,Leela," Hey, guess who I just got off the videophone with?
",5212303,Bender," No.
",512304,Leela," My parents! They're coming up from the sewers for a visit Sunday.
",6712305,Amy," Are you off your rocket? Your parents are mutants. It's illegal for them to come above ground 'cause they're inferior genetic scum. Uh, present company excluded, of course.
",17412306,Leela," I'm getting them a special one-day surface permit from Citihall.
",6612307,Hermes," Ooh. While you're there, could you pick me up a licence to kill?
",6612308,Leela," Sure. Bare hands or weapon?
",2912309,Hermes," Uh, what does piano wire count as?
",3612310,Farnsworth," Good news, anyone. The Swedish robot from Pi-kea is here with the super collider I ordered.
",9312311,Ï€kea Robot #1," Enjoy your affordable Swedish crap.
",3712312,Fry," Let's see what tools we'll need.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. Alright, we're all set.
",8512313,Bender," Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one's own hand.
",7112314,Bender," Ah, there. Finished. And with only six missing pieces!
",5612315,Fry," Those Swedes sure know how to put in almost everything you need.
",6612316,Leela," Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with Mighty Thor.
",7812317,Fry," I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.
",3612318,Zoidberg," I've got just the thing: Genuine miracle cream I bought from a travelling salesman.  ""Come one, come all,"" he said. ""Step right up!"" ""This sounds too good to be true,"" I thought. He said I looked like a smart, young man. ""So is it a deal?"" I enquired. Two hours later he was gone, with 60 of my dollars. But I have the miracle cream--
",33612319,Farnsworth," Bad news, nobody. The super collider super-exploded. I need you to take it back and exchange it for a wobbly CD rack and some of those rancid meatballs.
",15412320,Man #1," Excuse me. hi! Do you have a minute? I live in Jersey City and my car broke down and I need to get back because my Aunt's real sick and she needs this medicine but I need money for the bus. So I'm mugging you. Hand over your wallets.
",23512321,Leela," I don't believe that story for a second.
",4212322,Man #1," It doesn't matter, I'm mugging you.
",3712323,Fry," There's no bus to Jersey City.
",3212324,Man #1," Give me your wallets now or my robot'll shoot.
",4812325,Andrew," Don't make me hurt you.
",2512326,Fry," I'm too scared to find my pocket. Here, I'll just take of my pants and give you those.
",8812327,Man #1," Hey! I don't like what I'm seeing. Give it to him, Andrew!  Give it to him again, Andrew!  What the-- Laser-proof shirts, huh? I'll show you.
",14312328,Leela," Huh? Hey! Quit it!  Hi-yah!
",2912329,Man #1," Foiled. And after years of planning.
",3812330,Andrew," You're outta the game!
",2412331,Leela," How did we manage to survive? What gave us those strange powers?
",6612332,Fry," Maybe we're all wearing magic rings but they're invisible rings so we don't even realise it. Also, you can't feel the rings.
",12612333,Leela," Fry, shut up and look at this!  May cause superpowers in humans.
",6612334,Fry," Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think it'd be something you have to freebase.
",11012335,Leela," Let's see. Which powers do we have? Super-strength?
",5312336,Fry," Yup.
",612337,Leela," Uh-huh. Lickety speed?
",2412338,Fry," Check.
",812339,Leela," Yes, sir!  Ability to command the loyalty of sea creatures?
",6112340,Fry,"  Hey, Zoidberg, get in here!
",3012341,Zoidberg,"  Screw you!
",1312342,Leela," Ain't got that.
",1712343,Fry," Nope!
",712344,Leela," Wow. Superpowers! I'll be able to pack my day with twice as many humdrum activities.
",8612345,Fry," Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid, what was your biggest fantasy?
",10012346,Leela," To have parents.
",1812347,Fry," Whatever. The correct answer is: To be a superhero. We have superpowers and we're Americans. This is our chance.
",11412348,Leela," Hmm. I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates my violence. Let's do it!
",10312349,Fry," You'll barely regret this!
",2812350,Bender," Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers.
",7312351,Leela," It's true. Thanks to this funky-fresh cream.
",4612352,Fry," Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo.
",6112353,Bender," Wow! Crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah, duos are good. Of course sometimes they're a little short-handed.  See you. With two humans, you'd think there'd be a robot in there to balance things out but whatever.  I have these three costumes you could use. But I guess I'll just throw one away.
",30712354,Leela," We'd love to have you on the team, Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime?
",9312355,Fry," Plus the cream won't give you superpowers. You're a robot.
",6012356,Bender," So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this.  Also I got this going.
",7612357,Leela,"  Listen up, New New York: There's a new group of superheroes in town! And we're--
",8312358,Hattie McDoogal,"  Quiet! It's 4am and I just fell asleep for the first time in 30 years!
",7312359,Leela,"  Sorry!  A new era of justice has begun.
",4212360,Hattie McDoogal,"  What?
",812361,Narrator,"  Attention, all crooks, lowlifes and lawbreakers. Do yourselves a favour and crawl back into your filthy tenements, you human cockroaches. Or get your ugly face punched to custard by ... The New Justice Team.
",21012362,Fry," Captain Yesterday!
",2012363,Leela," Clobberella!
",1412364,Bender," And Superking! The best one of the three!
",4312365,Fry,"  Wow!
",712366,Song," Go, go, go, New Justice Team,
",3112367,Song," Go, team,
Go, team,
Team, team, team,
",3912368,Song," Who's the newest Justice Team?
The New Justice Team!
",5412369,Song," Captain Yesterday is fast,
Also he is from the past,
Not just fast but from the past,
",8712370,Song," Captain Yesterday!
",2012371,Song," Superking has all the powers of a king,
Plus all the powers of Superman,
Also he's a robot,
Ain't it cool?
Superking, you rule!
",12912372,Song," Clobberella beats you up,
Clobberella beats you up,
Who does she beat up?
You!
",8012373,Song," Clobberella!
",1412374,Song," Citizens, never fear,
Crazy do-good freaks are here,
Until they run out of steam...
",8512375,Song," Miracle cream,
Miracle cream,
Gives the power to the team,
",6012376,Song," It's effects wear off for sure,
So they just slop on some more,
The New Justice Team!
",8712377,Bender," Ta-da!
",812378,Woman #1,"  Captain Yesterday, I find your skintight high-waters incredibly sexy. Let's get together sometime.
",10112379,Fry," Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so once I reveal my real name to you along with my home address and a copy of my birth certificate--
",13712380,Leela," Are you crazy? We have to keep our secret identities secret.
",6212381,Fry," From everybody?
",1712382,Leela," Especially from everybody.
",2812383,Fry," Give several reasons why.
",2712384,Leela," For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage, and we don't wanna get our butts sued.
",9512385,Fry," Or do we? No, I guess not.
",2812386,Leela," Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones.
",10812387,Bender," Superking has no need for loved ones.  How ya doin', kid?
",5912388,Poopenmeyer," There you go. Two one-day mutant surface passes.
",5012389,Leela," Thank you, Mayor Poopenmeyer.
",3112390,Poopenmeyer," Mayor here. What's that? Horrible crime in the works? Ruthless villain? Citizens in danger? That's fantastic news!  Because I get to summon the New Justice Team!
",16312391,Leela," Sh!
",512392,Poopenmeyer," Uh, they're usually here by now.
",3412393,Leela," Well, so long. Keep in touch.
",3112394,Poopenmeyer," Wait, stay and meet the superheroes. There's three of you and three of them so it'll be perfect.  Is this clown on? Where are those daring crime stoppers?
",15612395,Leela," Oh, I completely forgot. I left my apartment on fire!
",5512396,Bender," Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's.
",4012397,Fry," And I can't take life anymore.
",3212398,Poopenmeyer," Clobberella! Captain Yesterday! My liege! You're just in time.  We've received a tip that the Museum of Natural History will be robbed tomorrow at exactly 9am. The target: The priceless Quantum Gemerald.
",20512399,Fry," Who's the perp?
",1712400,Poopenmeyer," A dangerous villain known as The Zookeeper, who commits crimes aided by a pack of highly-trained animals.
",10712401,Fry," Pack of highly. Got it!
",2512402,Poopenmeyer," His crew includes a badger with a troubled past and nothing left to lose, an elephant who never forgets -- to kill! And a seldom-used crab named Lucky, a.k.a. Citizen Snips.
",17512403,Leela," You can count on us, Mr. Mayor. Justice away!
",4712404,Bender,"  Hold the elevator!
",2112405,Bender," We're in here too.
",2012406,Fry," Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum.
",12312407,Leela," Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents right there at the same museum at 10.
",9612408,Bender," 9, 10 a big fat hen.  The name's Bender!
",4212409,Leela," I can't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist. It's just rude!  Total hell! It's 10! I'm supposed to meet my parents and I'm still in my secret costume!  There they are!
",18612410,Munda," How could Leela not be here? Do you think she forgot?
",5512411,Morris," Relax. I'm sure she's just ashamed of us.
",4312412,Security Guard #1," Yo! Freakjobs! Hit the nearest manhole, pronto, like.
",5512413,Morris," But we have passes that allow us to be up here. From the mayor himself.
",7312414,Security Guard #1," I dunno. I never heard of no mayor.
",3712415,Randy," The Zookeeper!
",1612416,Zookeeper," Sorry I'm late. Long story. Now everybody hit the deck! I'm cutting the entire line and stealing the exhibit.
",11112417,Leela," You're not stealing anything! Nobody hit the deck!
",5212418,Zookeeper," Ah, the superheroes. Or should I say superzeroes!
",5112419,Fry,"  That was uncalled for.
",2512420,Zookeeper," Animals, attack.
",1812421,Tour Guide," Please do not feed the animals!
",3312422,Bender," You're going down, my friend! Down Under!
",4312423,Roosevelt," Man boxing a kangaroo is a peculiar spectacle. But a kangaroo boxing a robot? Now I'm afraid you've lost me.   Citizen Snips!
",12712424,Zookeeper," Nice job, Fingers!
",2012425,Munda," I'm scared and confused. I think we've wandered into an off-Broadway play.
",7612426,Morris," No, there are way too many people here.
",4112427,Zookeeper," Later, if anyone asks when I got away, tell them right now!
",6112428,Leela," Forget it, Zookeeper! You're going into captivity.
",5212429,Zookeeper," Fool! A quip about putting me behind bars would have been far more delicious. Here, catch!
",9212430,Leela," No, Fry! You can't fall fast enough!
",3812431,Bender," I got it, I got it!  I don't got it!
",3812432,Roosevelt," You've saved the Gemerald!
",2812433,Fry," Yet the Zookeeper escaped, thus proving that the deadliest animal of all is the Zookeeper.
",9212434,Bender," You can get off me anytime.
",2912435,Leela," Oh, no! My parents are leaving. I've gotta go change back into street-Leela.
",7812436,Photographer #1 #1," It's the New Justice Team!
",2812437,Photographer #1 #2," Can we get some photos?
",2512438,Poopenmeyer," Thank you, mysterious heroes. The value of the Gemerald you saved is slightly greater than the cost of the damage you caused to this museum. A net gain for our great city!
",17312439,Munda," It's good that Leela doesn't love us. She'll be less sad when we die.
",7112440,Leela," Mom? Dad? I showed up! And I got the audio tour for Treasures of Liberace's Tomb.
",8312441,Morris," Sweetie, it's OK. You don't have to apologise for standing us up on the only visit to the surface we'll ever have.
",11612442,Leela," I wanna tell you why I didn't show up, but I can't. Just please believe me that it was a very good reason. I'm sorry I disappointed you.
",13812443,Munda," Leela, you could never disappoint us.
",3912444,Morris," We're so proud of everything that you are, and we always will be. Because you're our baby girl.
",9712445,Leela," Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!
",4912446,Morris," Galloping gators!
",1912447,Munda," You're a superhero?  Well that's wonderful! But did you have to make the costume so revealing?
",9612448,Morris," Look at me! Proud dad of a superhero! We should print up T-shirts. And F-shirts for our friends with two arms on the same side.
",12912449,Leela," No, listen. It's very important that you never, ever tell anyone under any circumstance.
",9012450,Morris," What if I've had a few?
",2512451,Leela," Dad, you drink? No. Not even then.
",3612452,Morris," Alright. My sucker is sealed.
",3112453,Leela," In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing this around here.  It was brisk, I dressed in layers.
",9212454,Munda," That's my girl!
",1712455,Morris," So, uh, anyway, my daughter's Clobberella.
",4412456,Raoul," Leela is Clobberella?
",2312457,Leg Mutant #1," You're pulling me!
",2012458,Morris," Sh. keep it under your sock. It's a big secret. That's why I'm only telling you two.
",8612459,Big-Eared Mutant #1," Oh, my God! That guy's daughter is Clobberella. But don't tell anyone.
",7212460,Big-Mouthed Mutant #1,"  Gotcha!
",1012461,Zookeeper,"  Greetings, superheroes. Remember me?
",3912462,Farnsworth," I don't remember much, buddy. And you're no looker!
",5312463,Leela," Uh, Professor, isn't it time for your nap?
",4412464,Farnsworth," Yes, damnit!
",1412465,Leela," Zookeeper! How did you know our real identities?
",5012466,Zookeeper,"  Let's just say a little bird told me.
",4012467,Parrot,"  Leela told her parents. Leela's parents blabbed.
",5112468,Fry," Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?
",7512469,Leela," Yes. My parents were so hurt, I couldn't help it! But I distinctly told them not to tell anyone.
",9812470,Bender," We are not amused.
",2012471,Zookeeper,"  And here's something you may or may not find interesting.
",6012472,Leela," Mom! Dad!
",1112473,Munda,"  Leela, please forgive us! Especially your father who's the one who told. Thank you very much, Morris.
",10412474,Leela," Are you alright? Has he hurt you?
",3512475,Morris,"  No but my allergies are going nuts.  Oh, God!
",4812476,Munda,"  Every couch and table has animal fur all over it. He lets them climb on everything!
",8612477,Leela," Alright, Zookeeper. What do you want?
",3912478,Zookeeper,"  Why, the Quantum Gemerald of course! You must steal it for me before midnight or your parents will be devoured by piranhas that I have, shall I say, persuaded to walk on dry land.
",18212479,Munda,"  Save us, Leela! I mean, if you don't have anything better to do.
",6712480,Leela," We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!
",5412481,Fry," But, should superheroes commit a crime, even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?
",9212482,Bender," Hmm. The thought of stealing anything fills Superking with disgust. But if it must be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!
",12612483,Fry," Oh, no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!
",4812484,Leela," Check inside the cap. There might be a caked-in goldmine.
",5912485,Fry," El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned.
",3612486,Bender," El zilcho? Is it too late to change my superhero name?
",5612487,Leela," Just be cool. Nobody knows we're super-powerly challenged.
",6012488,Fry," Man, this costume is so damn heavy!
",3712489,7Â_Â_ Clerk," Hey, Captain Yesterday? Can I, like, wail on you with this 2-by-4 and it doesn't hurt you?
",9212490,Fry," Ow! That ... didn't hurt.
",2712491,Security Guard #1," Hi, superheroes. Everything OK?
",3312492,Leela," Big O, little k, my friend! Just checking if everything's alright.
",6812493,Security Guard #1," It's OK, alright!
",1912494,Leela," OK, then. Grab it!
",2012495,Tate," Yo! The superheroes have turned evil! Most uncool.
",5212496,Security Guard #1," Get 'em!
",1012497,Leela," Stay back! Or we'll, beat the tar out of you ... using superpowers!
",6912498,Fry," So this is your lair?
",2312499,Zookeeper," Of course not. You think I'd show you my lair? My lair's a million times nicer than this!
",9112500,Fry," OK, take it easy!
",1912501,Bender," Well, here's your lousy Gemerald.
",3512502,Zookeeper," Hawk! Fetch!
",1412503,Fry," That seemed unnecessary.
",2612504,Zookeeper," Our transaction is complete. Come, Solomon. To the lair.
",5812505,Leela," Mom! Dad! Oh, I'm so sorry I got you kidnapped by a crazy madman who tried to feed you to piranhas.
",10112506,Munda," We're just happy to be involved in your life.
",4712507,Leela," No, no. It's my fault for telling you I was a superhero.
",5812508,Morris," That's true.
",1412509,Leela," I just couldn't stand to have you to think I was ashamed of you.
",6612510,Munda," That's sweet, honey. But it's natural for children to be a little ashamed of their parents.
",9312511,Fry," Oh, yeah!
",1112512,Morris," Just like it's natural for parents to be a little disappointed in their children-- N-Not that we are.
",10312513,Munda," But you could call a little more often.
",4112514,Leela," OK.
",512515,Munda," And would it kill you to use some mouthwash?
",4612516,Bender," Hey, Fry, we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?
",7312517,Fry," I guess, as long as you think it's right.
",4312518,Bender," Superheroes away!
",1912519,Song," Go, go, go, New Justice Team,
Fighting justice is their quest,
Superking, Clobberella, and all the rest,
Here's to you, New Justice Team,
Do the things that make your team,
Help each other do some things,
Winners don't use drugs,
The New Justice Team!
",25312520,Zoidberg,"  Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
",6412521,Fry," There's no denying it, the future's crazy! Oh, well. Don't wanna stand out.
",7712522,Fryand Zoidberg,"  Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
",6412523,Zoidberg," There's nothing crazy about it. It's just Freedom Day!
",5612524,Farnsworth," ...an extremely dangerous mission...
",3812525,Fry," So, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like some kind of feminine hygiene product.
",7712526,Zoidberg," No, it's a fabulous, crab-ulous day!
",3812527,Amy," If you wanna do something, you do it, and to splick with the consequences!
",7612528,Bender," You know, like how I live every day.
",3812529,Hermes," Happy Freedom Day! Ooh! I think my wrist is broken.
",5312530,Farnsworth," Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day without the traditional Freedom Tub!
",7612531,Hermes," Mmm! That'll feel nice on my shattered bones!
",4712532,Fry," Wow! Nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!
",6912533,Zoidberg," Then consider the following lecture a bonus: On Earth, freedom is a given. But on my planet, we have to suffer for it.
",12012534,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1," Sure, you can be a comedian instead of a doctor -- if you want your parents to roll over in their graves!
",10712535,Decapodian Man #1," Sure, you can vote for Shkinadel -- if you want there should be a recession!
",7812536,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1," Sure, you can go to medical school -- if you've given up on your dream of being a comedian!
",9312537,Zoidberg," That's why I love Earth! You can do what you want, and no one makes you feel guilty because no one cares.
",10712538,Fry,"  We're not listening!
",2312539,Zoidberg," That's what I'm talking about!
",3212540,Stilt People,"  Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
",6412541,Bender," Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train arriving on track one.
",6412542,Woman #1," Ow! You broke my foot!
",2412543,Bender," Freedom!
",1012544,Morbo," What's this next float, Linda?
",3212545,Linda," Representing our men, women and children in uniform, it's Earth's greatest space hero, Zapp Brannigan!
",10412546,Zapp," Happy Freedom Day, ladies!  Come on, let loose and show me something!  Anything. Seriously, I'd take an armpit.  Oh, yeah! Thank you, Linda!
",14212547,Linda," You're welcome! OK, Morbo, now it's your turn.
",4812548,Morbo," If that is your Freedom Day wish.
",3512549,Nixon," Thank you, Secretary of Transportation. My fellow Earthicans, we enjoy so much freedom it's almost sickening. We're free to choose which hand our sex-monitoring chip is implanted in. And if we don't want to pay our taxes, why, we're free to spend a weekend with the Pain Monster.
",28112550,Pain Monster," See you April 15th, folks!
",2812551,Nixon," Cue the fireworks guy!  Incidentally, tonight's Freedom Day celebration is brought to you by ...  ... ""Shankman's Rubbing Compound"".  When something needs rubbing, think ""Shankman"".
",18312552,Bender," Yay! Shankman!
",1612553,Hermes," It costs a little more but it's worth it!
",4312554,Nixon," Our planet has been through so much this past year: Wars, droughts, impeachments! But we've never lost our sense of what's truly important: The great taste of ""Charleston Chew""!  And now, let us salute that beloved symbol of freedom, our flag, Ol' Freebie!
",25812555,Zoidberg," I'm swelling with patriotic mucus!
",3612556,Nixon," In our darkest hour we can stand erect, with proud, upthrust bosoms!
",7012557,Fry," Anyone who laughs is a Communist!
",3512558,Nixon," Knowing that, with a shifty glance skyward, we will see by the rocket's red glare that our flag is still there.  It's gone!
",12512559,Zoidberg," Yes, fellow patriots, I ate your flag. And I did it with pride. For to express oneself with doing a thing is the very essence of Freedom Day! Bless this planet and all its wonderful people!
",19112560,Nixon,"  Kill him! Kill the traitor!
",3012561,Man #1," Hey, it's the guy who desecrated our flag!
",4412562,Nixon," Stop that red menace!
",2312563,Zoidberg," I'm all scuttled out!  Huh? My planet's embassy? They're paid to not kill me! A-yoop!
",8712564,Zoidberg," I thought I understood this world. I thought I was fitting in. But I guess I don't belong on here anymore than I belong on our crappy home planet-- Ooh, sorry.
",16112565,Decapodian Man #1," What sorry? Our planet stinks, we all know it.
",4812566,Ambassador Mervin," Enough with the persecution, I'm saying. Zoidberg, as Ambassador, I promise you the full support of our government, already.
",12612567,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1," Poor boy. You want maybe a nice mug cocoa?
",4412568,Zoidberg," Ambassador Mervin, you and your staff are so kind. I'm truly humbled.  What, no marshmallows?
",9512569,Nixon," Let's storm the place ... without my prior knowledge.
",5512570,Bender," Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train, step aside. You too, fatso. Freedom!
",7912571,Leela," Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag. You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow offensive. But the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Earth Constitution.
",24112572,Nixon," Aroo! Maybe so. But I know a place where the Constitution doesn't mean squat.
",7912573,Myrtle Fu," The Supreme Court hereby accepts the case of Earth vs. Zoidberg.
",6612574,Nixon," Sock it to 'em!
",1712575,Crowd,"  Two, four, six, eight,
Eating the flag is bad.
",4912576,Scout Leader," Now your noose knot has exactly seven twists.
",4712577,Man #1 #2,"  You can eat my dog. You can eat my truck.
But you eat my flag and you're outta luck!
She's a-wavin' proud around the world, from Dallas to Fort Worth.
Let me say it again...
",17612578,Crowd,"  Don't mess with Earth!
",2512579,Fry," They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.
",3012580,Bender," Pft. Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool.
",5612581,Fry," Where are we ever going to find a lawyer to take his case?
",6012582,Leela," I'll ask the head of the ACLU -- once he's done singing.
",5812583,Man #1 #2,"  Don't mess with Earth.  Kill Zoidberg! Goodnight!
",5212584,Old Man #1 Waterfall," Howdy there! I'm a lawyer and I'd like to help your friend out of his pickle.
",7912585,Fry," Who are you, old man?
",2312586,Old Man #1 Waterfall," Name's Old Man Waterfall but most folks just call me ""Old Man"".
",6512587,Fry," I'll never remember that.
",2712588,Old Man #1 Waterfall," I'm a veteran of three dozen wars. Name a body part and a planet and I've taken a bullet in it, on it. All to keep our flag flying free.
",13812589,Bender," And you wanna defend Zoidberg? Are you familiar with the old robot saying ""does not compute""?
",9512590,Old Man #1 Waterfall," Son, to me a robot's just a garbage can with sparks comin' out it.
",6812591,Bender,"  The sparks keep me warm.
",2712592,Old Man #1 Waterfall," I don't condone what Dr. Zoidberg did but I'll fight tooth and nail for his freedom to do it. Or I would if I hadn't lost my teeth and nails on Mars and Saturn respectively.
",17512593,Fry," Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!
",3812594,Fry," You OK there in the embassy, Zoidberg?
",4012595,Holo-Zoidberg," No. There's no cocoa marshmallows, and every night the rats eat a little more of my foot!
",9112596,Bailiff," Oyez, oyez, oyez. All rise for the Honourable Chief Justice, Myrtle Fu, and the Associate Justices.
",10112597,Myrtle Fu," Counsel, you may address the court on behalf of Earth, if you're ready.
",7312598,Hyper-Chicken," I was hatched ready! Honourable judge heads, yonder crawdad done ate up our flag.
",8312599,Holo-Zoidberg," I was doing freedom of speech, Earth's most sacred right.
",5912600,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, freedom of speech applies to what comes out of a mouth, not what goes in.
",8812601,OConnor," Can counsel cite precedent?
",2912602,Hyper-Chicken," Uh, yes, darlin', I can. In State Of Alabama vs. Giant Space Iguana, chewin' the corners off the Constitution was deemed non-protected speech.
",14412603,Souter," He shut you up, O'Connor.
",2712604,Myrtle Fu," Mr. Waterfall, you may now present arguments on behalf of Dr. Zoidberg.
",7312605,Holo-Zoidberg," Oh, God, I'm nervous. Two of my three hearts are having attacks.
",6612606,Bender," Court's kinda fun when it's not my ass on the line! Nachos?
",6112607,Old Man #1 Waterfall," Oh, land-o-Goshen! Your Honours, I'm not some slick, big-city lawyer like my opponent here.  But I am a veteran who has fought for his planet. You see this hand of mine?
",17112608,Scalia," Yes, I do.
",1212609,Old Man #1 Waterfall," No, you don't  'Cause I lost my real hand plantin' the flag when we took back Halley's Comet! Yet it was worth it, so much do I love that flag.  I love it even more than I love my seven wives -- that's right, I'm a polygamist.  Yet I would gladly eat a flag myself, had I not used my intestine as a rope to hoist a flag made of my own skin, if it would protect the freedoms of the proud people who salute that flag.  Freedom such as polygamy.  I rest my case.  Whoa, jeez!
",47412610,Myrtle Fu," The Justices and I will now confer using high-speed telepathy.  By a vote of six-to-three, we find that flag eating is not protected by the Constitution.
",15512611,Bender," Six-to-three? I beat the spread!
",3412612,Myrtle Fu," The court orders an immediate public apology.
",4712613,Holo-Zoidberg," Apology accepted. Just don't let it happen again.
",5112614,Hermes," She means you, you turkey of the sea!
",3912615,Holo-Zoidberg," Me? Apologise? Never! I came to this planet to learn the meaning of freedom, but I say it's you who should get a nice lesson! So do your worst because no punishment could be worse than denying my freedom.
",20612616,Myrtle Fu," You are hereby sentenced to death.
",3612617,Holo-Zoidberg," Wait, let me finish!
",2212618,Myrtle Fu," Also, in a rare double-whammy decision, the court finds polygamy constitutional.
",8212619,Old Man #1 Waterfall," I can't wait to tell my husband!
",3412620,Zapp," Remember, men, take him alive so there's something left to kill.
",6612621,Ambassador Mervin," Stay back! This embassy is sovereign mud of the mud planet Decapod 10. Invading these mud premises is an act of war.
",11812622,Zapp," Yeah? Well what are you going to do about it, Shrimp-y?
",5712623,Ambassador Mervin," You wanna see, Mr. Big-Shot?  Attack Earth.  Yes I know it's a schlep. Just do it!
",8412624,Zoidberg," Aha! Now the rubber band's on the other claw!
",4712625,Zapp," Ready ... retreat!
",2012626,Patron,"  Shh!
",712627,Zoidberg," Deny my freedom, will you? Well we'll do to you what we did to the Squash Men of the Squash Planet! Squish them!
",11412628,Ambassador Mervin," Charleston Chew?
",1812629,Zoidberg," You bet!
",1012630,Zapp," Alright, Kif, let's show these freaks what a bloated, runaway military budget can do. Bring me the activation codes for our global defence network.
",14912631,Kif,"  Aye, aye, sir.
",1712632,Computer Voice," Commence lip identification scan.  No tongue.
",4712633,Zapp," We can't be too careful with these codes. Rumour has it a double agent may be aboard this very ship.  I'm watching you! You, ensign, what's your name?
",15212634,Ensign," Hugh Man, sir.
",1612635,Zapp," Hugh Man? Now that's a name I can trust. Run down to the central battle computer and enter these codes. Chop, chop!
",11712636,Kif," Um, sir? There's something about that ensign that's--
",5512637,Zapp," You're damn right there is! That strapping young lad's gunning for your job. And he just might get it.
",10412638,Zapp," The enemy approacheth! Lieutenant, fire missile one and recommend me for another medal. Make it gaudy, I'm going clubbing later.  Tick, tock!
",14312639,Kif," Sir, all planetary defences have been disabled. Perhaps the Decapodians acquired our secret codes, somehow.
",10912640,Zapp," Well, Kif, stand by to take the blame. Steady, steady ... now!
",6412641,Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave all of Earth?
",8012642,Zoidberg," Bah! Your planet doesn't deserve freedom until it learns what it is to not have freedom. It's a lesson, I say.
",11212643,Fry," Ow!
",512644,Bender," What the hell is this dirt pile we're building, anyhow?
",5712645,Zoidberg," None of your beeswax, slave! You'll find out soon enough. Just focus on globing that mud.  Glob!
",9812646,Fry," I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school. Y'know, to become a barber?
",9512647,Leela," This can't go on. Today is the day we fight back!
",5112648,Bender," It's already 10 o'clock!
",2612649,Leela," Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back.
",5412650,Zapp," Yeah? Well good luck, sister. All our modern technology is useless.
",6912651,Bender," I know I am.
",1412652,Fry," Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know, a headache with pictures?
",8012653,Leela," An idea?
",1012654,Fry," Back in my day we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons, but we still managed to kill each other just fine.
",11412655,Bender," Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 15th century.
",8812656,Fry," Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you could commit a war crime with--
",11512657,Bender," Wow!  Ow!
",1112658,Ambassador Mervin," Earth slaves, behold the fruit of your labours: The Mobile Oppression Palace.
",7912659,Bender," Neat!
",712660,Ambassador Mervin," I don't need to tell you that occupation forces are expensive. But with the Mobile Oppression Palace, a few dignitaries can oppress your entire planet for pennies a day.  Warships, dismissed!
",19312661,Old Man #1 Waterfall," Do your worst, you sea devils! I'll make my stand with Ol' Freebie. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!  My spirit!
",12912662,Frida," Great Grandpa, no!  Another victim of the mano-centric male-ocracy.
",6912663,Zoidberg," Ambassador Mervin, you killed my lawyer.
",4212664,Ambassador Mervin," You're welcome.
",1712665,Zoidberg," He defended my freedom when no one else would. He was a good and honourable man.
",8212666,Old Man #1 Waterfall," I request a Satanic funeral.
",3012667,Zoidberg," Is it possible that all this slavery and oppression is shmutzing up our freedom lesson?
",8912668,Ambassador Mervin," Ah, take a pill, Zoidberg.  Begin again with the crushing!
",6012669,Fry," You haven't won yet, Mervin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum, much less steal this ancient heat-seeking missile.
",12612670,Ambassador Mervin," I don't even know you.
",2412671,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1," Oh, it's gonna make such a mess!
",3412672,Ambassador Mervin," This is your secret plan? Meh! Heat-seeking missiles are useless against the Mobile Oppression Palace. All Decapodian technology is cold-blooded, like us!
",15612673,Zoidberg," All eyes on Zoidberg!  Ew!
",2812674,Bender," Hey, I need that to smoke!
",2812675,Fry," Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool.
",5712676,Zoidberg," Wait! People of Earth, listen. Yes, I'm desecrating a flag. But to preserve the freedom it represents!
",10412677,Leela," Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like I could stand to hug you! I can't, but you know what I'm trying to say.
",11212678,Crowd,"  Zoidberg! Zoidberg! Zoidberg!
",3212679,Zoidberg," Ah, if only they appreciated freedom this much on my home planet. Wait a second! They do! Because this is my home planet.
",12312680,Nixon," And now, to raise this beautiful new flag, a red lobster that won't ruin your dinner, Dr. John Zoidberg!
",10612681,Zoidberg," You're a nice man, Nixon.
",2712682,Scoop Chang," Dr. Zoidberg, how's about you take a bite of the flag for tomorrow's papers?
",7812683,Zoidberg," Oh, I couldn't.
",1712684,Nixon," No, no, no, go ahead. You've earned it!
",4112685,Zoidberg," Well, maybe just a taste.  Mmm! Now that's a grand, old flag!  I wonder what the Shroud of Turin tastes like.
",11112686,John DiMaggio," Wooo!  Two, three! 
",2112687,Farnsworth," Oh, my.
",912688,Bender," Here we go, y'all!
",2012689,Zoidberg," Zoidberg...Zoidberg...Z-Z-Z-Z-Zoidberg. 
",4212690,Bender," This is a story about all my friends!
",3912691,Farnsworth," Fry?
",612692,Fry," Unh!!
",712693,Farnsworth," Fry?
",612694,Announcer #1,"  Previously on All My Circuits...
",3512695,Antonio,"  I'm sorry, Father. But, somewhere along the way, I forgot how to be your son.
",8012696,Calculon,"  Why, Antonio?
",1612697,Antonio,"  Because ... I have amnesia!
",3012698,Monique,"  Calculon? But I thought you were--
",3712699,Calculon,"  Egyptian?
",1212700,Monique,"  Before I kill you, I must ask you one question: Who am I? For I have ... amnesia!
",8412701,Calculon,"  Let me get this straight: Does anyone here not have amnesia?
",6312702,Monique,"  Not sure.
",1212703,Human Friend,"  I 'unno.
",1112704,Cubert," This show is awesome! When I grow up I'm gonna have so much amnesia!
",7012705,Dwight," Me too. I mean, I have it now, but I forgot.
",4612706,Cubert," Well, mine's louder!
",2212707,Bender," Cram a ham in it, you twerps!  Sorry!
",3912708,Fry," Nah, I had it coming.
",2312709,Calculon,"  Welcome, swingers. Pull up a groove and get fabulous.
",5612710,Monique,"  Nude rocks bands, big piles of what I assume is talcum powder. It's quite a birthday party, Calculon.
",10412711,Cubert," Cool! I'm gonna have a fabulatious birthday party just like Calculon!
",7112712,Dwight," Oh, yeah? Well I'm gonna show up looking good, just like Monique.
",6712713,Leela," Do you two have to imitate everything you see on TV?
",5412714,Cubert," Um, we're 12. So, yes.
",2412715,Dwight," Hold up, Cubert. You're a clone of the Professor. Do clones even have birthdays?
",8212716,Cubert," Um, duh!
",1012717,Dwight," ""Duh"" what?
",1312718,Cubert," Dad? Do I have a birthday?
",2812719,Farnsworth," Hmm. You didn't have a birth so, technically, no.  Oh, don't feel bad. We can celebrate the day I extracted you from the cloning tank, or the day I scraped your DNA from that growth on my back.
",19512720,Cubert," Ooh! That one!
",1612721,Farnsworth," Ah, yes. It was 13 years ago next week.  I used this very fork.
",6512722,Hermes," Aw, well isn't that-- Ew!
",2712723,Dwight," Hey! Next week'll be my birthday too.
",3912724,Hermes," That's true. If only there were a way to have one party for both of you here at the office then write it off as a business expense. Wait! I thought of a way! The way I just said!
",18012725,Cubert," Yeah!
",712726,Dwight," Way to go, Pops!
",1812727,Bender,"  Something's happening on television.
",3912728,Calculon,"  Oh, Monique, why did we wait so many years to bathe in champagne?
",6812729,Antonio,"  Father, I've discovered the shocking secret mother has kept from you for 200 years.
",8612730,Monique,"  No! No!
",1012731,Antonio,"  Brace yourself. For when I speak these words, you may well suffer an attack of explosive amnesia. For you see, the horrible secret is--
",13812732,Bender," Whoever's directing this is a master of suspense!
",5112733,Sal," He's busteds. Let's get hims outta heres.
",4312734,Announcer #1,"  We now join America's most popular show already in progress, Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad.
",9112735,Fry," This show's been going downhill since season three.
",5312736,Zoidberg," Look who's here, everyone! It's Zoidberg, the lovable tramp!
",6212737,Leela," Since when are you performing at children's parties?
",5412738,Zoidberg," Performing? What? Please, if someone could spare me money to buy shoes--
",7412739,Dwight," This party pukes.
",1912740,Cubert," Yeah! The guests were supposed to be here three hours ago.
",6012741,Farnsworth," Well, that doesn't mean that no one is coming or that you two are total losers. Who gave you that idea?
",10512742,Dwight," Alright! They must have all come as a group.
",4612743,Cubert," Welcome, swingers! Pull up a groove and get fabulous.
",5512744,Tinny Tim," Good day, fellows. Someone dumped this invitation in my begging cup. Happy growth-scraping day to all!
",10412745,Hermes," Fire 'em all.
",1512746,Farnsworth," Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
",1512747,Bender,"  Guys! Guys! Something's happening on television again.
",5712748,Morbo,"  Welcome to Entertainment And Earth Invasion Tonite. Across the galaxy, my people are completing the mighty space fleet that will exterminate the human race! But first, this news from Tinseltown.
",19712749,Linda,"  Following Antonio Calculon Jr.'s breakdown on the set, the popular TV show All My Circuits will hold an open casting call for child robots to replace him.
",15712750,Bender," An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
",8712751,Tinny Tim," What's that, sir?
",1912752,Bender," That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!
",4212753,Tinny Tim," You raised my hopes and dashed them quite expertly, sir.  Bravo!
",6612754,Leela," Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There's a lot of famous child acting units here.
",10912755,Fry," Look! There's Macaulay Culkon.
",3212756,Leela," He's just not cute since he got puberty installed.
",5212757,Fry," Pst. There's that robot child actor who grew up and robbed a convenience store!
",8112758,Leela," And there's that robot child actor who grew up and became a convenience store!
",8012759,Robber-bot," Lottery ticket, please.
",2512760,Casting Director #1," We're ready for the first audition.   Emotitron Jr.?
",5412761,Mombot," Hold on, precious. Let's make you look nice for the lady.  What's this?  What did I tell you?  No more hanging wires!
",11912762,Casting Director #1," In this scene, you've just found out your real father is Calculon's fourth evil identical septuplet, Sleazy Martinez. OK ... take us there!
",14112763,Emotitron Jr.," Now that I know the truth, Father, I must ride south and join the robo-bandidos at Veracruz.
",9412764,Bender,"  Awful! Boo! This kid sucks! We want Bender! Boo!
",5112765,Calculon," Well, I thought he was good but the audience seems to have turned on him.
",7512766,Casting Director #1," But I don't think--
",2112767,Calculon," Next!
",712768,Macaulay Culkon," --At Veracruz. So, if you'll kindly hand me my poncho--
",5712769,Bender,"  Boo! Bring on Bender! Boo! Bender's the greatest!
",5212770,Calculon," Sorry, kid. You're flailing up there.  90 actors and they all got boo-ed. I just wish we could get this Bender I keep hearing about. They say he's the greatest.
",16212771,Casting Director #1," Well, there is a robot named Bender here but he's much too old for--
",7012772,Calculon," Send him in forthwith!
",2412773,Bender,"  Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!
",3512774,Casting Director #1," Mr. Bender?
",1312775,Casting Director #1," Have you ever been on TV before?
",3412776,Bender," Once, when I took those hostages.
",3512777,Calculon," I saw that! You were good. Let's hear you audition.
",5312778,Bender," Bandidos, eh? Aw, this is great! 'Cause I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent!   I will see. Adios Padre! Come, Jesus, my faithful ... chee-huey-hua. Tonight we eat ... gee-wack-a-mole by the El Rio!
",20612779,Calculon," That was so terrible I think you gave me cancer! I don't care how popular you are. You will never work on my show!
",11612780,Fry,"  Yay, Bender!
",1512781,Leela,"  We demand Bender!
",2012782,Calculon," However, you've got the job. Welcome aboard, son!
",5112783,Bender," Father-o!
",1112784,Calculon," Bender, I'd like you to meet our director ...  ... whose name I never learned.
",8012785,Bender," Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire.
",9412786,Director #1," Uh, don't worry about the script, baby. We re-wrote your part to better suit your acting abilities.
",10112787,Bender," So now my character has a British accent?
",4312788,Director #1," No, now your character's in a coma. Get in bed and don't move.  And ... action!
",8112789,Bender,"  Stupid dumb coma ... coulda been British.
",4412790,Calculon," Alas that mine only son should sink into an irreversible, permanent ... coma.
",7912791,Bender,"  Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' up.
",7712792,Calculon," Curse the tragic wildebeest accident that--
",4512793,Bender," Hey, everyone! Antonio here, but you can call me ""Bender""! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut.  C'mon, baby!  Come on!
",12812794,Calculon," I'm not familiar with the type of thing I'm seeing.
",5312795,Bender," Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!
",6612796,Director #1,"  Cut!  That's the worst coma acting I've ever seen. We'll have to shoot it again.
",8312797,Calculon," No! No, no, no. I don't do two takes.
",3912798,Director #1," But this guy was--
",2012799,Calculon," Amateurs like you do two takes. I do one take. Print it. I'll be in my three-storey trailer.
",9412800,Bender,"  Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!
",6712801,Bender," Now that's hospital dancing.  Pretty good, eh, Calcky?
",5612802,Calculon," Good? I've seen better acting from extras in Godzilla movies.  I don't even remember shooting this scene.
",10712803,Director #1," We didn't. That's security camera footage from your dressing room.
",6812804,Calculon," He stole the scene and my money? That's it! I demand you fire this felonious ham!
",8312805,Director #1," The network Execubots are coming!
",3512806,Calculon," Oh, dear God!
",1512807,Betabot," Presenting the president of the network.
",4212808,Network President," Greetings, gentlemen. You already know my Execubots: Executive Alpha, programmed to like things it has seen before.
",11712809,Alphabot," Hey, hey, hey.
",1612810,Network President," Executive Beta, programmed to roll dice to determine the fall schedule.
",7312811,Betabot," More reality shows.
",2112812,Network President," And Executive Gamma, programmed to underestimate middle America.
",6612813,Gammabot," It's funny but is it going to get them off their tractors?
",6012814,Network President," Now, who put this obnoxious, dancing robot on my network?
",5912815,Director #1," We were about to fire him, sir.
",3312816,Network President," Silence, hack! We've been monitoring our Nielsen families carefully. And during the 12 seconds Bender was on screen, viewer eyeball focus was up 90%.
",15112817,Calculon," But, sir, children watch this show. Bender's no role model, he's a filth monger!
",8212818,Network President," At our network, we love filth! Filthy rich, that is! Being filthy rich, that is!  ""Bite my shiny metal ass"" could be a catchphrase.
",13312819,Alphabot," 80% likely.
",1312820,Gammabot," It will play in Peoria.
",2512821,Betabot," Gameshows are back.
",2112822,Network President," We need this edgy, sweeps-ready robot on our network. Bender? Can you continue to drink, smoke and steal things on TV?
",12012823,Bender," Yes, I can.
",1312824,Tinny Tim," Yeah! Shooting!
",1712825,Dwight," Alright!
",1012826,Dwight," Yo! Check out what I jacked from my dad.
",4212827,Cubert," A cigar!
",1012828,Tinny Tim," Ripping!
",1012829,Dwight," Look! I'm Bender!
",1912830,Hermes," Ras H. Tafari! What's goin' on here?
",3812831,Farnsworth," The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.
",4112832,Hermes," That's not a cigar. Uh ... and it's not mine!
",4712833,Cubert," Hey, Dad! Bite my shiny metal ass!
",3612834,Farnsworth," What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us! Where did you learn such language?
",9812835,Tinny Tim," From Bender, my good jerkwad.
",3112836,Hermes," Bender, eh? That guy's really startin' to twist my dreads.
",6012837,Bender," OK, OK, OK. Get ready for this part.
",3812838,Zoidberg," Quiet, robot! Bender's on TV.
",3112839,Monique,"  Oh, Calculon, it's so good to get away from the city and that beastly, yet intriguing, Bender.
",9712840,Bender,"  Try this, kids at home!
",2612841,Linda,"  Is television sensation Bender a bad role model for Earth children?
",7012842,Bender," That's crazy!
",1512843,Linda,"  A new protest group, Fathers Against Rude Television, says ""Hell, yes!""
",7412844,Fry," Pft! What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group?
",6112845,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group.
",7212846,Zoidberg," That was uncanny.
",1912847,Hermes," Fathers Against Rude Television don't want our kids watching Bender's high-definition filth.
",9412848,Farnsworth," And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? That's not what F-A-R-T is all about.
",7912849,Hermes," No, sir! Not us FARTers.
",2612850,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model.
",8412851,Leela," As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.
",10012852,Fry," Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
",5112853,Cubert," Our dads are all pumped up on dork-osterone. We're just trying to be cool, like Bender.
",8912854,Dwight," Yeah, and it's not even working. Smoking and drinking make us barf.
",6912855,Tinny Tim," Gentle jerkwads. I know how to emulate Bender without barfing. We could commit a burglary.
",9212856,Dwight," Hey, yeah!
",1212857,Cubert," Bender loves to burgle!
",2512858,Dwight," Hold up, though. Who could we rob? We don't even know anyone with cool stuff.
",7912859,Cubert," Duh! We know someone who runs on pure cool fuel: Bender!
",5812860,Dwight," Whoa!
",712861,Tinny Tim," We'll rob Bender!
",1912862,Dwight," TV gave us the idea.
",2212863,Bender,"  You're watching Futurama, the show that does not advocate the cool crime of robbery.
",8712864,Cubert," OK. It's crime time.
",2212865,Fry," Hey, Bender.  Hey, Bender.  Hey, Bender.  Hey, Bender.
",5612866,Farnsworth," What's going on in here?  Oh. Now I'm really outraged.
",5612867,Hermes," Where did you requisition this party? And Zoidberg, what are you doing here?
",7812868,Zoidberg," I'm networking. Let me give you my card.
",4212869,Cubert," Relax, Dad. We just invited a few friends over.
",4912870,Farnsworth," Hmm. There's something wrong with your story but I can't put my finger on it.  Of course! You don't have friends!
",11512871,Hermes," Yeah. Why do these popular kids consider you cool all of a sudden?
",6812872,Dwight," Um ... we're just cool, is all!
",3312873,Farnsworth," Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's cool, using the cool-o-meter!
",7012874,Cool-o-Meter," Oh, yeah!
",1112875,Farnsworth," Good Lord! I'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies.
",5912876,Hermes," Everybody out!
",1612877,Zoidberg," So, do you guys know about anything else going on, because I'm totally still ready to party.
",9412878,Hermes," There's enough cool stuff here to furnish a happenin' pad. Where did it all come from?
",8812879,Tinny Tim," Don't tell, comrades. All for one and one for all!
",5212880,Dwight," We stole it!
",1412881,Tinny Tim," Oh, crumb!
",1212882,Bender," What? What's going on?
",2412883,Farnsworth," I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst and coolest of crimes.
",9412884,Hermes," And all from watching you on TV, you cool jerk.
",4912885,Bender," Hey, lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender is about entertainment, baby! You can't hold me responsible for what kids do when-- Hey! This is my stuff they stole!  That's the last straw! Bender should not be allowed on television!
",27112886,Bender," Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I am?  Come on! We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats!
",18812887,FART Mob,"  Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender!
",7412888,Bender," This mob's with me.
",2112889,Security Guard #1," Go ahead.
",1112890,FART Mob,"  Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with--  Bender! Down with Bender!
",9512891,Calculon," As a doctor and captain of this hospital ship, I now pronounce you man and wife with six months to live.
",10612892,Farnsworth," Listen up, Hollywood. We're an exciting, new mob.
",5112893,Bender," Yeah!
",712894,Hermes," You'd better believe it!
",2612895,Calculon," Great Shatner's ghost!
",2412896,Bender," We demand that all TV's be equipped with a B-Chip that blocks Bender from appearing on the screen.
",10012897,Farnsworth," Booya!
",812898,Network President," I'm afraid the answer is a gritty, in-your-face no.
",5312899,Bender," Then I quit.
",1412900,Network President," Then you don't quit.  I think you'll be finishing the scene now, Mr. Bender. And don't skimp on the nasty.
",10812901,Farnsworth," There'll be no further nasty.  We still have the option of resorting to violence.
",8312902,Hermes," What makes you think that'll work?
",3612903,Farnsworth," I saw it on TV in that episode where Bender shot Calculon. How cool was that?
",7912904,Bender," Ooh, yeah! C'mon--
",2012905,Farnsworth," Quit the show!
",1612906,Network President," Do the scene.
",1512907,Farnsworth," I'm a cold-blooded punk!
",2612908,Network President," I once put a laugh track on a sitcom that had no jokes in it.
",6312909,Bender," Hey, look! The prop guy has a lamp!
",3712910,Network President," Really?
",912911,Farnsworth," Wha?
",612912,Bender," Aha!
",612913,Farnsworth," I was using that!
",1912914,Bender," Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation.
",12612915,Director #1," You're angry.
",1512916,Bender," Perfect.  Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV really make me cool? Of course they do.  How 'bout committing crimes and violence? Again, the answer is ""yes"". But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV? I say absolutely not!  Uh ... on the other hand, most, perhaps all the blame, rests with the parents. That's right, you!  And so I ask you this one question: Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
",49812917,Hermes,"  We're just so busy.
",2212918,Bender," Well make time.
",1712919,Director #1," And ... cut!
",1412920,Calculon," Good enough. Splice in some reaction shots of me and shove it on the air.
",7512921,Bender," Â : Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
",10212922,Hermes," Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable lesson about TV there.
",6412923,Cubert," What was it?
",1412924,Farnsworth," Uh ... that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while.
",11112925,Fry," Hear, hear!
",1312926,Leela," Yeah!
",712927,Bender," Damn right!
",1312928,Dwight," So, should we turn it off now?
",3212929,Farnsworth," Well, uh, that depends what's on.
",3512930,Fry," Nothing good.
",1512931,Farnsworth," Ah, let's just keep watching.
",3112932,Bender,"  TV party tonight!
",2012933,Farnsworth," Wha?
",612934,Bender,"  TV party tonight!
",2012935,Farnsworth," Oh!
",512936,Fry,"  We've got nothing better to do.
",3412937,Leela,"  Than watch TV and have a couple of brews!
",4412938,Zoidberg,"  Don't wanna talk about anything else.
",4012939,Fry,"  We don't wanna know!
",2312940,Farnsworth,"  We're dedicated, yes!
",2412941,Hermes,"  To our favourite shows!
",2612942,Cubert," All My Circuits
",1712943,Dwight," Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad!
",2912944,Amy," Scary Door!
",1312945,Leela," Blernsday Night Blernsball!
",2912946,Bender," Futurama!
",1112947,Bender," For my next trick, notice I have nothing up my sleeves ...  ... and nothing in my head.  So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me with an ordinary, non-fake pitcher of milk...  Behold, the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!
",25512948,Fry," Amazing! That's why they call you ""Bender the Magnificent""!
",6112949,Bender," No, it isn't.
",1512950,Fry," Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th century pizzeria, just like the one I used to work at.
",9412951,Bender," Interesting. No, wait, the other thing ... tedious.
",5312952,Fry," Let's go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.
",6612953,Bender," You lived before you met me?
",3012954,Fry," Sure. Lots of people did.
",2712955,Bender," Really?
",912956,Bender," Truly, they were as gods who built this place!
",4812957,Tour Guide," Next, we come to the splendidly-preserved wooden pizza paddle.  Scientists theorise it was used to gently discipline the delivery boy.
",13612958,Fry," Wait a second! This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria!  And for your information, lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt. It was also used to move pizzas and crush rats.
",19712959,Tour Guide," I don't know where you get your facts, sir, but I am a volunteer housewife with 45 minutes of orientation and a Harlequin romance about archaeologists.
",15312960,Fry," Don't wave your fancy degrees at me! I recognise all this stuff.  Petrified sausages, old Mr. Patelli. And that's--
",11712961,Man #1,"  Yes?
",712962,Fry," Pizza delivery for Mr. ...  ... Seymour Asses.
",4812963,Man #1,"  There's no one by that name here ... or anywhere. I hope that in time you'll realise what an idiot you've been.
",11412964,Fry," I wouldn't count on that.
",2712965,Fry," Aw! Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here ...  ... but if Mr. Panucci asks, your name is Seymour Asses.  I like you, Seymour. You're not constantly judging me like all the other dogs ... are you? Nah! We understand each other.  People think you're just a dumb mutt who smells bad, can't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job. But you're keepin' it real and you call no man ""Mister"".  Well, goodbye.  Live long and prosper.
",45312966,Bender," Yuck! That's the least appetising calzone I've ever seen!
",5912967,Fry," No! That's my dog in there. It's an outrage, I say!  I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me.  Uh-oh!
",12612968,Bender," And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified.
",7412969,Fry," Well it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging up Lassie and putting her on display in the Louvre.
",12512970,Amy," Lassie is on display in the Louvre.
",3712971,Fry," I know. I was deliberately describing a similar situation.
",6012972,Farnsworth," Why don't you try protesting? Like those native Martians; always whining that people don't treat their ancestor's bones with respect.
",13512973,Bender," Nah, protesting never works.
",3012974,Fry," You're right.  I'll give it a shot!
",3712975,Crowd,"  What do you want?
",2012976,Fry,"  Fry's dog!
",1312977,Crowd,"  When do you want it?
",2312978,Fry,"  Fry's dog!  I will now perform my people's native dance.
",5912979,Leela," It says this part of The Hustle implores the gods to grant a favour. Usually a Trans-AM.
",9012980,Fry,"  I'm walking on sunshine! Oh-oh-oh!  I'm walking on sunshine! Oh-oh-oh!   That a boy, Seymour! Right here waiting for me as always. Just like that huge mushroom in my shower.
",17612981,Panucci," Hey! There's our little mascot.  Aw, you been swimming in the sewer again?  You rascal!  Fry, cleanup!
",10412982,Fry," Seymour, cleanup!  Good dog!
",3012983,Panucci," That's a good Seymour!
",2412984,Boy," Yo! There's dog fur on my slice!
",3412985,Panucci," Nah, that's vermicelli! No fur in here!
",4112986,Fry," He's so cute! He can do two things at one time: Eat and swim. Ooh, three things!
",8212987,Leela," Fry, it's been three days. You can't keep boogie-ing like this. You'll come down with a fever of some sort.
",10912988,Ben Bee #1ler," Mr. Fry? I'm Dr. Ben Beeler, the palaeontologist who discovered your dog. Or as some call it, the ""Beelersaurus"".
",11512989,Fry," So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure?
",6512990,Bee #1ler," No, we're sorry but there's just too much that fossil can teach us about dogs from your time.
",9512991,Fry," His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxophonist. He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus.
",17012992,Ray," The 29? Interesting.
",2212993,Bee #1ler," That's all I needed. Ray?
",2712994,Ray," I'm good.
",1112995,Bee #1ler," OK then. Here's your dog back.
",3212996,Fry," Seymour!
",1012997,Bender," Lady and gentleman! How 'bout a hand for my temporary replacement assistant?
",7812998,Zoidberg," I was all in this part! It's magic!
",3712999,Bender," You are not fit to wear Fry's leotard!
",4013000,Zoidberg," Stop!
",713001,Fry," Good news, everyone!
",2213002,Bender," Hooray, he's back! And he's looking for a garbage can to put the rock in! Here you go, buddy!
",9513003,Farnsworth," No. Actually we've discovered that Fry's dog was fast-fossilised, preserving it's cellular structure!
",10313004,Fry," Which means we can clone it! Seymour will live again!
",5513005,Zoidberg," A little land mammal!
",2313006,Fry," Can you believe it, Bender? I'm going to have my best friend back!
",6813007,Cubert," Why the idiot convention?
",2713008,Farnsworth," Ah, Cubert, my precious babe. I'm going to attempt to clone Fry's dog using the very same apparatus I used to clone you.  Ooh, look! There's a smidge of toe still in here.  You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy, mineral shell, there's still a creamy core of dog nougat.
",27113009,Fry," So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?
",5913010,Farnsworth," Amazingly, yes. In cases of rapid fossilisation, I can press this brain scan button, retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death.
",15513011,Fry," I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!
",5713012,Bender," Crappy ineffective Reaper!
",2813013,Farnsworth," I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from Human Mode to Dog Mode.
",6713014,Computer Voice," The dog says--
",1613015,Farnsworth," Uh-oh, this may take a while.
",3113016,Boy," You stink, loser!
",1913017,Panucci," Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out. C'mon!
",3513018,Fry," But I'm celebrating New Year's Eve.
",3713019,Panucci," Like you got squat to celebrate! You're a delivery boy this millennium and you'll be a delivery boy next millennium!  What's with Seymour? It's like he don't want you to go. Or he thinks your pants is too short, or somethin'. Which is crazy 'cause, frankly, you look fabulous. Now get goin'!
",29313020,Fry," I won't be gone long, Seymour. Just wait here till I come back.
",6513021,Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for ...  ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!  Here's to another lousy millennium.
",9513022,Crowd,"  Five, four, three, two.
",2613023,Fry," What the--?
",1313024,Bender," A dog collar, for me?  You shouldn't have!
",4413025,Fry," That's for Seymour.
",2113026,Bender," Oh.
",513027,Bender," Say, why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl?  That's not a reputable journal of opinion.
",10213028,Fry," Oh, that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned.
",8113029,Bender," Are you on the junk, Fry? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior intelligence?
",9213030,Fry," Hey, he was smart! He could fetch.
",3613031,Bender," I can fetch.
",1413032,Fry," He could dig up bones.
",2413033,Bender," Hello? Charlemagne?  Plus, I bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head.
",8113034,Fry," Look, Bender, this has nothing to do with you.
",4813035,Bender," That's impossible!
",2013036,Fry," Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.
",6213037,Bender," No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I would. A tiny little house that says ""Bender"" on it.  Ow!
",14013038,Fry,"  This is Fry. If you're calling about the used towels for sale, they're still available for $45 each.
",10313039,Mr. Fry," Phil, it's your father. Where are you? You're holding up New Year's brunch. Your brother can't wait any longer.
",11313040,Yancy," Hello, first baloney of the new millennium!  Ah, here he comes. That's him and Seymour.
",8913041,Mrs. Fry," Well that's weird. Seymour's here but--  Go! Go! Touchdown! But where's Philip?
",8113042,Mr. Fry," I'm tellin' you, the Y2K computer's got him. We'll face burnin' roads, rivers exploding, calculators transformed into Scud missiles. There's nothing we can do.  What's that, Seymour? You walking on sunshine?
",20913043,Yancy," He's trying to tell us something. Maybe he can lead us to Philip.
",6713044,Yancy," Should we follow him?
",2313045,Mr. Fry," To our deaths? Negatory.
",2613046,Mr. Fry," It's the Y2K tryin' to lure us into an ambush. And I ain't buyin' it. Pass the baloney.
",8913047,Fry," Are you two gonna be done soon?
",3313048,Leela," Sorry, but we need to practise hand-to-hand combat in case an enemy knocks the laser guns out of our hands and they slide way across the room.
",14413049,Fry," Well could you do it some place else? I'm setting up Seymour's doggy bed.
",7513050,Leela," OK.
",513051,Bender," Heel, boy, heel! Oh, hello, Fry! I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such fun with my new best friend, Robo-Puppy.
",12613052,Fry,"  That's nice.
",1513053,Bender," I was just out walking him. Yes, you can walk him. Of course, after he goes you have to refill the canisters. C'mere, boy! Pet, pet, pet.
",13913054,Robo-Puppy," Robo-Puppy receiving petting.
",3113055,Amy," Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy? That's so adorable!
",6113056,Bender," Jealous?  Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek.
",8413057,Robo-Puppy," Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek.  Robo-Puppy commencing cheek-licking. Licking in progress. Licking complete.
",11413058,Bender," Robo-Puppy truly is robot's best friend, huh?
",4713059,Fry," Ah, there! Perfect!
",2113060,Holo-Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! The Clone-O-Mat is ready!
",4813061,Fry," Finally!
",1013062,Robo-Puppy," Robo-Puppy commencing two-hour yipping session.  Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert! Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert!
",11213063,Farnsworth," Behold once more, the mighty Clone-O-Mat! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself.  I speak, of course, of molten lava deep within the Earth's core. To the sub-basement!
",23213064,Farnsworth," Powering up Clone-O-Mat.  Placing fossil on the Plat-Clone-O-Form.  Initiating dog brain CAT scan.
",10013065,Fry," Come on, boy! Come back to life!
",3413066,Farnsworth," Know ye now what feels like to be dog god! Commencing DNA extraction.
",7113067,Bender," Fry, c'mon, the talent show!
",3013068,Fry," What? I'm in the middle of something.
",3913069,Bender," But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?
",6013070,Fry," Bender, enough! Leave me alone!
",3313071,Bender," So that's how it is, huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog so much, maybe you'd rather play fetch!
",12213072,Leela," No!
",513073,Zoidberg," Oh!
",513074,Bender," Now I'm all you got!
",2213075,Fry," I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man!  Ow!
",5013076,Bender," So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.
",5613077,Farnsworth," Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive.
",4713078,Fry," May yet? Really?
",1813079,Farnsworth," Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite; The tough black mineral that won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's affect on this ice swan.  Of course, that would have melted even at room temperature. I just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite, there's a slim chance it might have survived.
",37713080,Fry," So Seymour might still exist?
",3113081,Farnsworth," Perhaps, for a few minutes. It's dolomite, baby!
",5013082,Fry," Then I'm goin' in after him.
",3013083,Amy,"  No!
",613084,Leela,"  Stop!
",813085,Fry," He'd come after me!
",2113086,Leela," Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back.
",4813087,Fry," Then all hope is lost.  Goodbye, Seymour.
",4313088,Bender," Please stop crying, Fry. Here.  I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog to toy with my emotions. Oh, what have I done?
",13113089,Zoidberg," You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up.
",4913090,Bender," Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature, because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty.  I'm goin' in!
",25713091,Farnsworth," I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite.
",14913092,Bender," I'm 40% dolomite!  Oh, it's hot! It's very hot!
",4913093,Cryogenicist," Ugh! I am one hungover cryogenisist. Just throw that mutt in the freezer till his owners get here.
",10013094,Plumber," You can't solve all your problems by freezing them, boss.
",5913095,Cryogenicist," I think you're forgetting our motto.
",3813096,Mr. Fry," Are you the cryogenisist who called about our son's dog?
",5813097,Cryogenicist," Oh, you must be the Frys. Yeah, he's right over there.
",5613098,Mrs. Fry," Sorry we're late. We all got sick from eating bad baloney.
",6013099,Mr. Fry," Y2K!
",613100,Mrs. Fry," What's he so worked up about?
",3113101,Mr. Fry," He's just upset 'cause our boy's missing.  C'mon, you overgrown rat. Lead us to Philip.
",8913102,Leela," Bender's been down there too long. I'm going in after him.
",6013103,Farnsworth," Professor! Lava! Hot!
",2313104,Fry," This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back.  Bender!
",9713105,Bender," And that is why they call me Bender the Magnificent!  Hey, where'd everybody go?
",8213106,Bender," OK! Let's clone us some dog!
",3013107,Fry," Yeah!
",713108,Farnsworth," Very well. Let this abomination unto the Lord begin!  Interesting. It seems Seymour died at the ripe old age of 15.
",11713109,Fry," 15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?
",6113110,Farnsworth," Indeed.
",913111,Fry," Stop the cloning.
",1913112,Farnsworth," Oh, sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!
",4213113,Bender," Fry, what's wrong?
",2013114,Fry," Think about it: Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably even added new songs to his repertoire.
",11313115,Bender," But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!
",6113116,Fry," I had Seymour till he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved him.  I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long, long time ago.
",15013117,Zoidberg," Hurry up with the water. I'm steaming inside my own shell, I am. It's that hot, it is!
",8813118,Leela," Hi-yah!
",913119,Fry," Man, it's hot!  How hot is it?  It's so hot, I poured McDonald's coffee in my lap to cool off.  Johnny Carson said it.
",12013120,Leela," No, Nibbler! Don't drink the pool water! It's full of chlorine!
",6513121,Bender," Lightweights! Oh, wait, chlorine!
",3513122,Farnsworth," Perhaps this movie will help us take our minds off the heat.
",6213123,Bender,"  Focus!
",913124,Narrator,"  Global Warming Or: None Like It Hot!
",3913125,Narrator,"  You're probably wondering why your ice cream went away. Well, Suzie, the culprit isn't foreigners, it's global warming!
",12213126,Suzie,"  Gwobal wappa?
",1613127,Narrator,"  Uh, yeah! Meet Mr. Sunbeam. He comes all the way from the sun to visit Earth.
",8013128,Mr. Sunbeam,"  Hello, Earth! Just poppin' in to brighten your day!  And now I'll be on my way!
",8213129,Gas,"  Not so fast, Sunbeam! We're greenhouse gases. You ain't goin' nowhere!
",7313130,Mr. Sunbeam,"  Ooh! Ah! Oh, God, it hurts!
",3013131,Narrator,"  Pretty soon, Earth is chock-full of sunbeams ...  ... their rotting corpses heating our atmosphere.
",10213132,Suzie,"  How do we get wid of the gweenhouse grasses?
",4713133,Narrator,"  Fortunately, our handsomest politicians came up with a cheap, last-minute way to combat global warming. Ever since 2063 we simply drop a giant ice cube into the ocean every now and then.
",18913134,Suzie,"  Just like Daddy puts in his drink every morning.  And then he gets mad.
",7413135,Narrator,"  Of course, since the greenhouse gases are still building up, it takes more and more ice each time.  Thus solving the problem once and for all.
",14513136,Suzie,"  But--
",813137,Narrator,"  Once and for all!
",2013138,Leela," Well, we just need one of those big ice cubes. Someone should call the losers who are supposed to deliver it.  Hello?
",11913139,Nixon,"  President Nixon here.  I'm hiring you losers to deliver the ice. And hurry up! I'm sweating like J. Edgar Hoover trying to squeeze into a new girdle!
",15213140,Farnsworth," You heard the good news, everyone! Save the Earth, et cetera, et cetera!  Bye!
",8013141,Fry," Wait! Where do we get the ice?
",3213142,Farnsworth," The wha? Oh, Halley's Comet, of course. The only sufficient source of ice cubes that don't have bugs in them.
",11113143,Fry," Wow! Mining a comet! That sounds fun.
",3913144,Farnsworth," Yes, there's no safer occupation than mining. Especially when you're perched on a snowball whipping through space at a million miles an hour.  Safe!
",15013145,Bender,"  Deploying ice drill.
",2313146,Fry," Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the ice crushes you!  Yakov Smirnov said it.
",8013147,Leela," No, he didn't.
",1613148,Bender,"  Activating ice drill.
",2413149,Fry," Oh, my God! It's out of ice! Like some outer space Motel 6!
",6113150,Leela," Completely out of ice?
",2413151,Bender," This could mean the end of the banana daiquiri as we know it ... also life.
",7713152,Linda,"  With Halley's Comet out of ice, Earth is experiencing the devastating effects of sudden intense global warming.
",11413153,Morbo,"  Morbo is pleased but sticky. The scorching heat has melted the polar ice caps, causing floods of biblical proportion.
",12013154,Randy,"  They called me crazy for building this ark.
",4613155,Soupy,"  You are crazy. You filled it with same-sex animal couples!
",6113156,Randy,"  Hey! There are parts of the Bible I like and parts I don't like.
",6713157,Morbo,"  Direct your attention now to the African turtles seen here migrating to cooler homes in Holland.
",9913158,Bender,"  That poor turtle!
",2013159,Fry," Bender? Are you crying?
",2513160,Bender,"  Uh, no! Never!
",1713161,Morbo,"  Morbo wishes these stalwart nomads peace among the Dutch tulips.
",6713162,Linda,"  I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.
",4813163,Morbo,"  Windmills do not work that way!  Goodnight!
",4613164,Bender," Well, everybody, I just saved a turtle. What have you done with your lives?
",7713165,Hermes," You went all the way to Holland already?
",4213166,Leela," Bender, a turtle isn't yourself. Why do you care about it?
",6013167,Bender," Because I also care deeply about things that remind me of myself. Like poor little Shelly here.
",9713168,Hermes," What could you possibly have in common with this walking soup mix?
",6813169,Bender," For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell.  But lead a rich, inner life. And also ... well, you know.
",10913170,Leela," You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gamblers?
",6513171,Bender," No! It's just ... neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back.
",7713172,Fry," What? I've seen you get up off your back tons of times.
",5713173,Bender," Those times I was slightly on my side.
",4013174,Hermes," Interesting. Maybe we should test this erectile dysfunction of yours, Bender.
",7913175,Bender," Uh, no! That's not necessary, really! I think I hear my factory recalling me.  Oh! That's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you.
",14113176,Van," Calling all scientists, calling all scientists. Be advised there will be a worldwide conference on global warming in Kyoto, Japan.
",13213177,Man #1," I've got a degree in homeopathic medicine!
",4413178,Van," You've got a degree in baloney!
",3313179,Amy," Professor Farnsworth, you're a scientist!
",4313180,Farnsworth," Forget it, I'm not going! I have my reasons! Shut up, all of you!
",6713181,Hermes," Strange. You haven't acted this suspicious since I found those ""ape bones"" in the basement.
",9313182,Farnsworth," My hip hurts! I'm in the middle of cooking a turkey! I have warranty cards to fill out! I am not just making excuses! Alright, I'll go!
",13713183,Woman #1 #1,"  Oh, God, I can't believe it!
",3113184,Woman #1 #2,"  I love you!
",1413185,Rivers," Oh, oh, oh! It's Professor Hubert Farnsworth! He's looking sharp in a standard white lab coat and dark slacks! His wristwatch is a Casio.
",13913186,Van," Thank you all for coming. It is my pleasure to introduce the host of the Kyoto Global Warming Convention. The inventor of the environment and first Emperor of the Moon: Al Gore.
",17913187,Al Gore," I have ridden the mighty Moon Worm.
",3713188,Fry," Good for him!
",1513189,Gore," My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss in my book Earth in the Balance and the much more popular Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth, we need to defend our planet against pollution. As well as dark wizards.
",20613190,Dark Wizard," Sure! Blame the wizards!
",2613191,Gore," That's why I'm offering a bag of Moon Sapphires to the first scientist who can solve this problem once and for all.  Lovely, aren't they?
",13913192,Dark Wizard," Sapphires?  With those I could open the Gate of Kerash!
",5713193,Gore," First up is Professor Ogden Wernstrom.
",4013194,Farnsworth," Wernstrom!
",1213195,Wernstrom," Ladies and gentlemen, I have placed in orbit a giant mirror that will reflect 40% of the sun's rays, thus cooling Earth. Observe.
",13113196,Wernstrom," Problem solved.
",1713197,Man #1," Ooh! That's a little bright.
",3013198,Gore," Alright, what else we got?
",2813199,Fry," Professor, you're a professor. You must have some ideas.
",5813200,Farnsworth," Absolutely not! I won't speak! I've got nothing to hide!
",5813201,Gore," Our next speaker is Professor--
",3313202,Farnsworth," I demand the floor!
",2113203,Gore," Yes, it's your turn to speak.
",3113204,Farnsworth," Well nuts to me. I'm taking the stage!  I know the source of the greenhouse gases. But in my shame I've kept it secret for 75 long years. Oh, it haunts my memory still.
",17013205,Fry," Professor, no! Don't do it!
",2913206,Farnsworth," Don't do what? Don't use this memory ray so I can remember what happened back then?
",8513207,Farnsworth,"  It was October 17th at 1:54pm and 14 birds were flying by the window. I was working at Mom's Friendly Robot Company. Back then, you see, robots were slow-moving, stiff and a little on the uptight side.
",20413208,Prototype," Oh, dear. Might I favour master with a tender kiss on the forehead?
",6913209,Farnsworth," Oh, I've failed again.
",2413210,Prototype," Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
",3113211,Farnsworth,"  The owner of the company pressured me to create a bigger sportier robot.
",7513212,Farnsworth," Stop!
",713213,Farnsworth,"  It wasn't easy but, by sacrificing fuel efficiency, I succeeded.
",6713214,Mom," What was that?
",1613215,Farnsworth," A flaming burp.
",1713216,Mom," Does it always do that?
",2513217,Farnsworth," It's not always a burp. We still have one problem though: This robot will never meet emission standards.
",10613218,Mom," Crap spackle!  We'll just call it a sport utility robot and classify it as a light truck.
",9113219,Farnsworth," Well, I suppose the environment can take one more for the team.
",6513220,Farnsworth,"  What a fool I was. If only I had made the effort to develop a cleaner-burning robot. But I was tired and in love.
",11613221,Mom," Take me now, you stud!
",2413222,Farnsworth," Oh, this is all my fault!
",2713223,Fry," That's awful, Professor. Especially the making-out part.
",5813224,Gore," Yeah, I didn't need to hear that.
",3513225,Farnsworth," All modern robots descend from my original smog-blasting designs. And that's the cause of global warming today.
",11313226,Wernstrom," Huh, so the robots are to blame. As I suspected.  We are left with only one possible course of action, grim though it be.
",12313227,Bender," I got a good feeling about this!
",3413228,Wernstrom," We must immediately and permanently shut down, dismantle and destroy all robots!
",8213229,Bender," No!
",513230,Farnsworth," Wait, surely there's a better--
",3313231,Van," The conference is over.
",2513232,Gore," I must go now, to help collect cans on Jupiter. Peace out, y'all!
",6713233,Crowd,"  Destroy all robots! Destroy all robots!
",4213234,Amy," Poor Bender.
",1413235,Fry," Be brave, my friend.
",2213236,Leela," Come on. You've got to come out of your chest sometime.  Would you do it for a Bender snack?
",9413237,Fry," Aha!
",613238,Leela," Gotcha!
",913239,Bender," Let me go! I don't even want the stupid beer!  Yes! You tried to trick me into coming out of my chest. But who has the beer now?  I've got mail!
",14613240,Amy," Ooh! It's a party, apparently.
",3213241,Nixon,"  Do you like to party? To boogie down? Well I'm throwing an all-night beach raver for my robot pals. It all goes down Saturday on the isolated Galapagos Islands where there will be no escape ... from the fun! All robots must attend.
",23413242,Zoidberg," Strange: Why would Nixon, an awkward, uncomfortable man, suddenly throw a party, one of the most social events imaginable?  It's a trap, is why! They're going to deactivate all the robots!  I don't hear any gasping.
",21713243,Leela," We all figured that out.
",2613244,Bender," Well, I'm off.
",1613245,Fry," Wait! We could hide you. We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a bowl.
",7513246,Bender," No. I'm going to the party.
",2913247,Fry," I won't let you!
",1813248,Bender," Fry, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, vengeance, Father O'Mally's weed whacker. But, at long last, I've found something I'm willing to die for: This mindless turtle.
",20513249,Fry," Bender, this world isn't good enough for you.
",4713250,Bender," Not even close. Goodbye, everybody! Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead.   It's booby trapped!
",9613251,Robot #1 #1," Oh, yeah!
",1113252,Robot #1 #2," Come on, baby!
",1613253,Bender," Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if I had a drink.  Crummy keg! It's completely ta-- Oh, you're a robot!
",10713254,Keg Robot #1," Don't stop!
",1313255,Bender," Ew!
",513256,Nixon," Attention, happening robots: Who's got what it takes to party with Nixon?  You fellas enjoy yourselves for the next two hours. And be sure not to leave the island, uh, for at least two hours. I'm going out to pick up some smokes ... uh, really good smokes. Two hours.  OK, headless body of Agnew, let's blow this joint!
",32113257,Crushinator,"  Do you want to dance?
",2413258,Bender," Nah, I'm not really in the--
",3013259,Crushinator,"  You know you want to.
",2413260,Wernstrom," Per your orders, I modified my mirror to fire a colossal electromagnetic pulse at the Galapagos. Every robot will be instantly and painfully terminated. Now for your part of the bargain.
",18813261,Nixon," Aroo! Very well. Agnew, you belong to Wernstrom now.
",5413262,Bender," I'll say goodbye now. There ain't not turtles where daddy's a-going.  Don't tell anybody, but Nixon's about to shut all robots off and--
",13813263,Boom Mic-bot,"  What?
",813264,Robot #1 #3,"  We're gonna die!
",1913265,Preacherbot,"  We're going to the great beyond!
",3513266,Chain Smoker,"  Nixon's not bringing the smokes!
",3513267,Bender," Shut up and pay attention to me, Bender!  Look, I love life and its pleasures as much as anyone here. Except perhaps you, Hedonismbot.  But we need to be shut off! Especially you, Hedonismbot!
",19413268,Hedonismbot," I apologise for nothing!
",2613269,Bender," We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles.
",7413270,Preacherbot," To hell with the turtles!
",2713271,Bender," No one insults the turtles!
",2913272,Preacherbot," Oh, mercy!
",1213273,Bender," Come on!
",1013274,Hedonismbot," Let the games begin!
",2213275,Farnsworth," Everyone, listen!
",1913276,Preacherbot," Aw, damn!
",1113277,Farnsworth," I've devised a way to save you and stop global warming at the same time. Granted, you're all blasting out greenhouse gases--
",12613278,Bender,"  You're one to talk!
",2213279,Farnsworth," But we can use those very gases to save the planet. If you all vent your exhaust directly upward in one burst, it should thrust the Earth further from the sun, thus cooling it.  By my calculations, we'll need the full force of every last robot. So, quickly, everyone point your exhaust vents straight upwards.  Now vent! Vent like the wind!  Harder! Harder!
",35913280,Fry," Why isn't this working?!
",2613281,Leela," Some lazy or polite robot is holding it in.
",4513282,Bender," Help! Help!
",1313283,Farnsworth," A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished. Oh, the Jedis are going to feel this one!
",9513284,Bender," I'm sorry, buddy. At least we'll die on our backs, helpless.  Huh? What the hell are you doing?  Hey, you trying to make me look bad?  Aha! I'm even greater than I thought I was! And now to fulfill my destiny.
",21113285,Nixon," Fire!  What the--?
",2013286,Wernstrom," We missed!
",1213287,Nixon," Professor, for saving the Earth and foiling me, I proudly, yet angrily, present you with Earth's new highest honour: The Polluting Medal of Pollution.
",15213288,Farnsworth," Thank you. I deserve this!
",2813289,Bender," Hey, Professor, now that the Earth's orbit is further from the sun, won't that make the year longer?
",10213290,Farnsworth," Why, yes! One week longer to be exact.
",4013291,Nixon," In that case I hereby declare it Robot Party Week!
",5213292,Bender," Alright, baby!
",1613293,Farnsworth," Pazuzu, you ungrateful gargoyle! I put you through college, and this is how you repay me?
",9113294,Farnsworth," Let's get this gargoyle hunt on the road. Driving gloves, driving goggles, driving thong. There!
",9813295,Leela," Uh, maybe I should drive.
",2713296,Farnsworth," You? A woman? I'm trying to catch a monster, not find the quickest route to the mall! Let me just adjust the seat.
",11613297,Fry," My God! He's gonna do it! Everybody, seatbelts to maximum buckling.
",6913298,Farnsworth,"  Pazuzu? Oh, Pazuzu?
",2213299,Randy,"  Hey, grandpa, move your wrinkly old kiester!
",4713300,Farnsworth,"  Shut up!
",1113301,Leela," For Heaven's Gate, Professor. This ship can do 99% light speed. Why are we going 35 miles an hour?
",10013302,Farnsworth," Because we're in a hurry, that's why.
",3913303,Leela," Plus, you have the high beams on!
",3513304,Farnsworth,"  I can't quite read the sign.  Pazuzu? Pazuzu?
",4813305,Bender," Yo, Captain Cataract? What are we doing here?
",4713306,Farnsworth," Oh, it's 2.30. We can still catch the early bird dinner special.
",6613307,Fry," Uh, aren't we looking for your gargoyle?
",4213308,Farnsworth," My wha?
",913309,Farnsworth," Hello, Mavis! Surprised to see me back again so soon?
",5513310,Wanda," Mavis is dead.
",1613311,Farnsworth," I expect you'll want to see my angry, crotchety, grandpa discount card.
",7313312,Wanda," Sir, this card has expired.
",2913313,Farnsworth," But it's good for a lifetime.
",3113314,Wanda," Well, yours expired.
",2213315,Leela," Oh, Lord! Teeth do not belong in your pants, Professor.
",5713316,Farnsworth," Well, I can't keep them in my mouth. They're nuclear-powered!
",6313317,Fry," Ow! It bit my finger!
",2313318,Leela," No! No! It's tasted human blood!
",3413319,Farnsworth," Mmm! Damn good meat!
",2213320,Leela," Professor, we've talked it over and everybody thinks you're too old.
",7013321,Amy," Right on.
",1113322,Fry," Yup.
",613323,Bender," Uh-huh!
",913324,Hermes," We've decided to do the merciful thing and have you euthasised.
",6513325,Farnsworth," Dear God, no!
",1513326,Amy," Oh, relax, Professor. ""Youthasizing"" is a trendy, new spa treatment. It's this season's shark-cartilage enema.
",11213327,Farnsworth," But I like being old. I don't have to talk to my parents, no one asks me to help move their stuff, I don't need to understand today's ""edgy"" TV sitcoms.
",15413328,Leela," OK, OK. We're not gonna force you until I finish this sentence. Get him!
",7413329,Farnsworth,"  My thong!
",1213330,Heather," Hi! I'm Heather, your personal Youthasizer. Let's get started with a nice botulism treatment, shall we?
",10513331,Farnsworth," Go to hell, Heather!
",2213332,Heather," Oh!  In small doses, botchelism toxin tightens and tones the facial muscles instead of killing you in the most horrible fashion imaginable.
",14113333,Farnsworth," Give me back my floppy face!
",3013334,Farnsworth," Careful with the giblets!
",2713335,Heather," Hmm. You're still retaining a lot of grump in these joints.  More pressure.
",7713336,Heather," Since this is such a serious case of old, we'll have to try our strongest treatment: A soothing full-body bath in searing-hot tar.  Sir, it's not necessary or wise to be naked.
",17813337,Farnsworth," You sound just like my tennis instructor.
",4313338,Heather," The tar blisters the age right out of the body in what top scientists suspect is a miracle.
",9313339,Farnsworth," Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
",15913340,Fry," He still sounds sorta old. Sorta real old.
",4413341,Bender," Step aside, lady.  Like everything else in life, pumping is just a primitive, degenerate form of bending.   C'mon, Bender, pump harder! Harder!  I'm trying as hard as I can.  Harder, damn you!
",19413342,Farnsworth," Well, that was an utter waste of time.
",4013343,Amy," Professor, it worked! You look young enough to be my father!
",6213344,Farnsworth," Poodle spit!  53 years old?  Now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn.
",7413345,Fry,"  This is great, Professor! We should go out and celebrate!
",6013346,Farnsworth," Dear Lord! You've all reverted to your childhood forms.
",5713347,Zoidberg," Hooray! I'm a teenage heartthrob again!
",4113348,Farnsworth," While I try to restore our normal ages, I expect you all to go about your jobs like responsible professionals.
",11213349,Hermes," It wasn't me, Mr. F. It was Amy!  Stop it, Amy!
",4913350,Amy," You stink!
",1213351,Hermes," You know you did it!
",2213352,Farnsworth," Quiet! Quiet, I say!
",2213353,Labarbara," We're here to take my little stub of a husband home. Hermes, say goodbye to Mr. Farnsworth.
",9313354,Hermes," Goodbye, Mr. Dumbsworth!
",2613355,Leela," Hey! This my chance to spend time with my parents too.
",5613356,Fry," But your parents are gross sewer mutants.
",4313357,Leela," When I was an orphan, I always wished I could grow up with my mom and dad. And now, thanks to being hurled backwards in time--
",12813358,Farnsworth," That's not what happened! Shut up and go live with your parents.
",6613359,Leela," It's gonna be totally awesome, Mom! You and me can bake and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face. And if some kid picks on me, my dad can beat up his dad.
",16613360,Morris," Can't I just beat up the kid?
",3113361,Munda," Well, OK, Leela. If you think you can put up with your father, then welcome home. We'll try to respect your independence and freedom.
",13513362,Leela," No! I want the real teen experience: Chores, curfew, the works!
",6513363,Morris," Fine, Sweetiekins, we'll be the strictest parents ever. Now, let's all have some tequila to celebrate!
",10413364,Leela," Dad! I'm underage!
",2013365,Morris," Oh, right. Here's a silly straw.
",3413366,Mrs. Wong," Oh, my Amy's sweet little girl again! This is like a mother's dream. Bad dream, that is! At this rate, I'm never going to get a grandchild!
",14113367,Leo," Maybe she not grown up but she sure grown out! She fat!
",5713368,Amy," Dad, if you're gonna make fat jokes till I get cute again, I'm just gonna stay in my room.
",9213369,Leo," Stay in room? You so fat, you gonna stay all around room!
",5913370,Farnsworth," I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours. And those jerks at social security stopped sending me checks. Now I have to pay them!
",22013371,Bender," I'm tired of your yapping.  All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things better. Well, I'm running away from this dead-end family! I know there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!
",22013372,Farnsworth," Fine! Get going!
",1813373,Bender," Oh, I'm going! You're gonna be all ""Where's Bender? I miss Bender"".
",6913374,Farnsworth," We won't know that until you leave.
",3713375,Bender," Oh, I'm leaving!
",1813376,Farnsworth," There's the door.
",1913377,Bender," I'll be good.
",1513378,Munda," Ah, do you have to shed your skin on the couch? What do we live in, a zoo?
",7613379,Morris," I'm getting the doorbell.  For me?
",3613380,Fry,"  Oh, uh, hello, sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um, I'm here to pick up your daughter.
",10113381,Leela," Hi, Fry! I like your blazer.
",3013382,Fry," Thanks. These aren't pockets, they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock.
",7813383,Munda," So, where are you taking my daughter tonight?
",4713384,Fry,"  A movie.  A movie, ma'am.
",2813385,Morris," Well, whatever you're really doing, don't wake us if you get in after 12.
",7513386,Leela," Dad, you're being too lenient again! I have to be back by 11.
",6313387,Munda," OK, OK. You're the boss!
",2613388,Leela," No, I'm not!
",1413389,Fry," I'd like a sewer burger but without the rat faeces.
",5313390,Leela," What are you, on a diet?
",2613391,Moose," Uh, Leela, you look hot.
",2613392,Man #1dy," Jeez, Moose! Just dump me right in front of her, why don't you.
",6513393,Leela," Moose, Mandy; this is my friend Fry, from the surface.
",5613394,Man #1dy," Oh, so this is the famous Fry. What is he, like, the biggest loser on the surface so he has to hang out in the sewer?
",11913395,Fry,"  They're onto me!
",1913396,Leela," Hey, come on! Let's act like grown-ups here. Wanna race?
",5813397,Moose," Uh, yeah!
",1113398,Sal," Theres. The world's drinkings water is safes for another days.  Whoas!  Cripe!
",8013399,Leela," A tapeworm!
",1313400,Fry," We missed the turn. We'll never catch them.
",4513401,Leela," Yes, we will. This sewer goes right under Planet Express, and it's 9pm!
",7313402,Farnsworth,"  The devil take this predictable colon!
",4113403,Fry," Yeah!
",713404,Leela," Alright!
",1013405,Fry," Leela, you can stop winning now. We won!
",4213406,Leela," I'm too short to reach the handbrake!
",3913407,Dwayne," That's detention!
",1913408,Fry," And then, and then, this giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps but we like totally dissed Moose!
",10313409,Farnsworth," Yes, I'd like to meet this Moose. But, in the meantime, I have good news. I may have solved our age problem.
",11013410,Fry," Yay!
",613411,Farnsworth," It seems the Youthasizing tar was saturated with time-altering Chronitons. A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA as well as Bender's robo, or ""RNA"".
",15113412,Bender," Question.
",1113413,Farnsworth," Yes?
",613414,Bender," You stink!
",1213415,Farnsworth," Yes, yes. Anyhow, I've designed an oil-eating bacterium that should take the tar right off.
",9313416,Fry,"  C'mon! Let's go tell Leela so we can grow up together!
",5713417,Leela," Thanks, Professor. But I don't want the treatment.
",5213418,Farnsworth," Don't you understand, you little nitwit? Unless you're treated soon, the only way to restore your true age would be to grow into it! Just as God intended.
",15613419,Munda," He has a point, honey. What about your job and your friends? Do you really want to abandon your old life?
",10713420,Leela," My old life wasn't as glamorous as my webpage made it look. All I ever wanted was to grow up here, with you. Please?
",11813421,Munda," Well if it's what you really want.
",3613422,Leela," It is. I know it is.
",2213423,Fry," I'll miss you, Leela. I'll come back and visit when I'm all grown up.
",7113424,Leela,"  Bring beer.
",1413425,Morris," No beer till you finish your tequila!
",3913426,Farnsworth,"  The age-restoring microbes are ready. Everyone into the bacterial spew chamber.
",8213427,Amy," Let's go!
",1113428,Bender,"  Yes, everyone do the same thing!
",3513429,Farnsworth," Initiating controlled infection.
",3413430,Zoidberg," I'm no doctor, but this machine guy could use a lozenge.
",5813431,Amy," Aw, pooh! We're even younger!
",3113432,Farnsworth," Day-umn! The bacteria pigged-out on the tar and now they're getting freaky-deaky, spreading Chronitons throughout our systems. We're getting younger by the minute!
",16513433,Amy," Yikes!
",813434,Zoidberg," What? I'm going to revert through all my larval stages?
",5713435,Farnsworth," Word! We'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than death: Pre-life ... then death.
",11613436,Farnsworth," I've got to stop this reverse-aging before we all shrivel up and suffer the agony of un-birth. Think, you disco duck, think!
",12613437,Amy," What's that squirmal under your shirt?
",4013438,Farnsworth," Get off me, you parasitic lamprey!
",3613439,Zoidberg," Oh, sure, like you need all your blood.
",4113440,Farnsworth," Would you all chill! I can't think with you kids cramping my style! Oh, I need a babysitter.
",9413441,Leela," OK, quiet time. I know, everyone pretend a goblin ate your tongue and I'll read you a story.
",9413442,Zoidberg," I can't see from down here, I can't.
",3813443,Leela," There. Today's story is from New Teen magazine. What would you rather hear about? Four-legged Chachi or tentacled Chachi?
",12313444,Fry," I wanna hear a space story!
",2913445,Leela," It's kind of a baby book. But OK. Let's see. Snow White Dwarf And The Seven Red Dwarves, Charlotte's Tholian Web, The Fountain Of Aging.
",13813446,Farnsworth," The Fountain of Aging? Hmm. It is just a legend. Still, they called the Tooth Fairy a legend and now he's head of the FBI.
",12413447,Farnsworth," Sup? Kids ready?
",1813448,Fry," Professy's back!  Ew! You smell like smoking!  And drinking.
",6213449,Farnsworth," I had a few beers but I'm cool to drive.
",4213450,Leela," I wish I could come with you to say goodbye, before you all turn back in to grown-ups but I'm grounded for knocking the school over.
",13413451,Munda," Who cares, Leela? It was just a public school. Now go with your friends, please.
",8213452,Leela," No! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room!
",5513453,Leela," Until she sneaks out!
",2313454,Bender," When I grow up, I wanna be a steam shovel!
",4413455,Leela," According to this, the Fountain is located in the darkest, most ancient region of space, just past Teddy Bear Junction.
",12113456,Farnsworth," Teddy Bear Junction: The worst scum-hole in the galaxy.
",5713457,Farnsworth," This solar system is, like, way old.
",3813458,Leela," Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet.
",6213459,Farnsworth," Newsflash! Everything's getting older the closer we get to that ancient, burnt-out sun.
",8913460,Leela," Dude, the Fountain of Aging must be on the sun itself.
",5613461,Farnsworth," Shut up! I was gonna say that!
",3213462,Leela," We've got to hurry. The kids have only one change of pants!
",6113463,Farnsworth," We gotta be real, real careful to stay in just long enough to make us our right ages again.   Zoidberg! Get out of there!
",12313464,Zoidberg,"  The current! It's too much, already! Help!
",4513465,Farnsworth," Jeepers!
",1013466,Leela," Zoidberg is dead!
",1913467,Zoidberg," No! Zoidberg's brother is dead!  Funny story: I just reverted to the age where my siblings budded from me and my brother Norman split off and jumped in the fountain.
",16713468,Sibling #1," He always had to be the centre of attention!
",4613469,Sibling #2," Let him go!
",1313470,Leela," Oh, no!  Quick! Get them into the fountain!
",4513471,Farnsworth," Thanks for the help, Weewa. Once we're gwown up, you can go back to your famiwy. We'wl never bother you again.
",11213472,Leela," Well, you could bother me a little.
",3713473,Farnsworth," It's working! Hooray!  I can't hold on!
",4113474,Leela," I'm coming in after you!
",2613475,Farnsworth,"  No, Leela! You can't give up your childhood! You'll never have another chance at it!
",8713476,Fry," We did it! We're the right ages again!
",4013477,Leela," I think I might be a couple years younger.
",4413478,Amy," Oh, me too!
",1313479,Farnsworth,"  Help! I'm still in mid-peril, you clods!
",4313480,Leela," He's too far out! We can't reach him!
",3913481,Farnsworth,"  With my last breath I curse Zoidberg!  Pazuzu! Oh, you came back to me!
",7413482,Hermes," Are you back to your original age, Professor?
",4713483,Farnsworth," Even older! Huzzah!
",2113484,Fry," I'm sorry you had to give up being a kid, Leela.
",5013485,Leela," Well, I guess every adult wants to be a kid again sometimes. But I worked hard to be the person I am.
",10313486,Fry," The fabulous person!
",2213487,Leela," With friends like you guys--
",3013488,Fry," Fabulous friends!
",1913489,Leela," And I'm really happy I have that life back.
",4513490,Farnsworth," And you, my faithful fiend! How can I ever repay you?
",5513491,Pazuzu,"  And zat, little one, is how Papa gained his freedom. Now, bonne nuit, bonne nuit to you all!
",9513492,Fry," Delivery boy Philip J. Fry, reporting for duty.
",4913493,Zoidberg," Dr. Zoidberg, soaking in brine.
",3313494,Fry," What is the meaning of this? We've got a delivery, people. Let's move! Let's move!  Amy? Mission profile?  Interesting, interesting. Dr. Zoidberg, mission bag?
",16113495,Zoidberg," Packed and ready, sir.
",2413496,Fry," What's this? This is the same toy surprise I got last time!  I can't work under these conditions. And without me there is no mission. I am the mission!
",15313497,Leela,"  We're back from the mission!
",3113498,Fry," Wh-What? You went without me?
",3113499,Bender,"  You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time.
",9513500,Fry," But-- But I'm the delivery boy.
",3313501,Leela," Don't worry. Everything went fine.
",3613502,Bender," Better than usual!
",2013503,Leela," We got medals! Good work, team! We really pulled together on this one.
",7213504,Zoidberg,"  They got medals.
",1913505,Fry," I'm real sorry I missed the mission. I wasn't there and you might have needed me.
",8313506,Bender," Nope.
",713507,Fry," But if I'd been there I--
",2713508,Bender," Nope.
",713509,Fry," Look--
",813510,Bender," Nope.
",713511,Fry," Bender's great--
",1813512,Bender," Nope!
",713513,Fry," Listen, Leela, let me make it up by taking you out to dinner tonight.
",7113514,Leela," Nope.  I've got a date with Chaz.
",3513515,Fry," Chaz?
",713516,Leela," I met him at that charity cock fight last week. He's the mayor's aide.
",7213517,Bender," Ooh! You go, mutant girl!
",2713518,Leela," I do go! He's a very important man.
",3713519,Fry," So? I'm just as important as him.  It's just that, the kind of importance I have ... it doesn't matter if I  don't do it.
",12313520,Fry," I'm nobody. There are guys in the background of Mary Worth comics who are more important than me.
",9913521,Bender," Ah, buck up, meatloaf. Bender'll take you out tonight and cheer you up. What do you wanna do? And I mean anything. You have the power! Name it and I'm there. You the man!
",17213522,Fry," Um, OK. Let's go bowling.
",2713523,Bender," Nah.
",613524,Elzar," Table for two? Step right this way.
",3713525,Chaz," I'm afraid we don't have a reservation but, uh, as you can see ...  ... I'm the mayor's aide. Table for two, please.
",11813526,Elzar," OK then.
",1013527,Elzar," Bam!
",613528,Chaz," It's OK, my man. I got you covered on your next health inspection.
",6813529,Elzar," I really appreciate that, mister mayor's aide.  Here you go. Compliments of the house.
",8813530,Leela," Wow! Free bread at a restaurant? Is there anything you can't do?
",6613531,Chaz," I can't fail the mayor. Not ever.
",3513532,Fry," Oh, jeez! Better not let Leela see me.
",4013533,Leela," Hey, I hear Fry.  Boy, am I glad you're here.
",4713534,Fry," You are? So things aren't working out with whatshisname?
",5813535,Leela," Actually ... they are! Confidentially, I might not make it back to my apartment tonight! Could you walk Nibbler for me?
",12113536,Fry," Um ... uh...
",1413537,Leela," And bring a baggy in case he drops a steamer.  Have a great night!
",6813538,Fry," Oh, no! Please! No!  Perfect!
",3113539,Smitty," Whoa! Smells like a 289 in progress.
",3813540,URL," Failure to scoop. Aw, yeah!
",2913541,Fry," Wait! I'm trying. It weighs as much as a thousand suns.
",5713542,Chaz,"  Don't worry, Fry. I'll pull some strings -- see if I can't get you tried as a juvenile.
",9013543,Leela," Oh, Chaz!
",1113544,Fry," I'm as worthless as this trash can.
",3713545,Trash Can," You think I'm as worthless as you? Try catching garbage in your head and raising six kids, you dumb townie!
",10913546,Fry," Oh, Nibbler, at least I'm important to you. Even if it's only 'cause I clean up you poop.
",9113547,Nibbler," The poop eradication is but one aspect of your importance.
",6013548,Fry," D-D-Did you just talk?
",2413549,Nibbler," Indeed. And I have other amazing powers as well.
",5013550,Fry," Like what?
",1213551,Fry," Are you my mommy?
",1913552,Nibbler," Negative.
",1113553,Fiona," Welcome, Lord Nibbler.
",2413554,Nibbler," Welcome acknowledged. I bring with me ... the Mighty One.
",5913555,Fry," Eh?
",513556,Ken," At last, our centuries upon centuries of waiting have achieved fruition.
",7413557,Fry," Aw! Aren't you a fuzzy wittle guy?
",3613558,Ken," Stop that! Uh, please. Your Mightiness--
",4213559,Fry," Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guinea pigs.
",8313560,Ken," Does he not know?
",1913561,Nibbler," He does not know.
",1913562,Fiona," He knows not?
",1513563,Nibbler," Knows not does he.
",2013564,Nibblonian," Not he know--
",1513565,Ken," Enough! Fry, it is my duty to inform you that the fate of humanity, the fate of our race, indeed the fate of all that exists and ever will exist rests with you. You are the single most important person in the universe.
",22013566,Fry," Oh, snap!
",1113567,Nibbler," On this auspicious occasion, let the horn of eternity cut a thunderous blast.
",7913568,Fiona," The Feast of a Thousand Beasts is begun.
",4213569,Nibblonian," You gonna eat that?
",2113570,Fry," Maybe later.
",1413571,Ken," The time has come to discuss matters of the gravest importance.
",6513572,Nibbler," Fry, do you remember some months ago when the Earth was attacked by flying brains?
",8413573,Fry," Hmm. I remember the square-dancing stomachs. Although that might have been a Mylanta commercial. Wait! The brains! I do remember! But no one else does. They said I was crazy.
",17613574,Ken," On the contrary. You remember because you were the only one immune to the Brains' mental attack.
",9813575,Fry," Because I'm so smart?
",2313576,Ken," Oh, my. Anyway, your immunity is due to the fact that you lack the delta brainwave.  It's a genetic abnormality which resulted when you went back in time and performed certain actions which made you your own grandfather.
",22213577,Fry," I did do the nasty in the past-y!
",3513578,Nibbler," Verily. And that past nastification is what shields you from the brains. You are the last hope of the universe.
",11313579,Fry," So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
",6513580,Ken," Yes. Except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
",5013581,Nibbler," For a thousand years, the evil Brains have been constructing the Infosphere, a giant memory bank twice the size of three ordinary memory banks.
",14513582,Fry," What's so evil about that?
",2813583,Fiona," They plan to collect all the information in the universe and store it in the sphere.
",8613584,Fry," So they're trying to learn things?
",3613585,Fiona," Right.
",813586,Fry," Those bastards!
",1713587,Nibbler," Being Brains, they feel compelled to know everything. And soon they will.
",7513588,Fry," I'm as mad as I've ever been.
",3113589,Ken," Once their task is complete, they will ensure that no new information arises in the only way possible: By destroying the universe.
",13213590,Fry," Now it's personal.
",2013591,Fiona," Your mission is to infiltrate the Infosphere and plant this quantum-interface bomb, blasting them into an alternate universe from which there is no return.
",15713592,Nibbler," Then outrun the blast on this Scooty-Puff Jr.
",4713593,Fry," OK, let's go through this once more--
",3913594,Fry," Brains!
",913595,Ken,"  Fear not, Mighty One. Your missing brainwave makes you invisible to them, so long as you avoid intense thinking.
",11513596,Fry," Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention.
",4113597,Ken,"  That is most wise.
",2113598,Fry," Who?
",613599,Ken,"  In a few seconds, the Brain will finish scanning the last bits of information in the universe.
",9713600,Infosphere,"  Beavers mate for life; 11 greater than 4; for quality carpets, visit Kaplan's carpet warehouse.
",9813601,Ken,"  Now the Infosphere will open its protective crust so as to scan itself, completing its thousand year task.
",10913602,Fiona,"  This is your one chance to enter the sphere. Scoot! Scoot now!
",6513603,Fry," I'm at the input console. I'm a little nervous and I've got brain in my buttcrack.
",8413604,Nibbler,"  Roger.
",913605,Ken,"  Once you press the detonator, you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape.
",8113606,Fry," Hey, wait. This brain knows everything about everything, right?
",6513607,Ken,"  It will soon. That's why you're supposed to be setting off a bomb.
",6913608,Fry," Yeah, yeah. But I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions of all time.  Is it true that postage stamp glue is made of--
",15113609,Huge Brain," Correct. Toad mucus.
",2213610,Ken,"  There's no time for this. Activate the bomb.
",4713611,Fry," Wait, wait, wait.  What really killed the dinosaurs?
",5413612,Huge Brain," Me!
",513613,Computer Voice," Unauthorized data access.
",2713614,Fry," Uh-oh!
",813615,Big Brain," Detecting trace amounts of mental activity. Possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon viewer.
",8913616,Fry," Ew! Gross. Cut it out!
",2413617,Brain #1," Odd. He is immune to our psionic attack.
",4213618,Brain #2," Impossible! We're an ambitious young squad with everything to prove.
",7013619,Big Brain," It appears we are in the presence of the fabled one. But without his Scooty-Puff Jr., he cannot escape.  Huh?
",11113620,Brain #2," A quantum-interface bomb? Are you insane in the membrane?
",5913621,Fry," You got it, poindexter!
",2513622,Brain #1," Oh, not good!
",1513623,Computer Voice," Detonation in T-60 Earth seconds.
",3513624,Brain #3," You fool! You'll be transported to the other universe with us. Trapped there for all eternity.
",9613625,Brain #1," And we'll form a tightly-knit clique that you won't be part of!
",6513626,Fry," Well at least I did one important thing with my life: Leading good to victory over evil!
",9013627,Nibbler,"  Yay!
",713628,Ken,"  Exactly!
",1113629,Big Brain," The Nibblonians? Good? Ha! During your last moments in this universe perhaps you should query our database concerning the night of December 31st, 1999.
",15313630,Fry," The day I got frozen? What about it?
",3813631,Nibbler,"  No! Don't ask about that! It-It would be, uh ... boring!
",5913632,Fry," Ah, forget it then.
",2113633,Big Brain," Query!
",813634,Fry," OK! Sheesh! What happened to me, Philip J. Fry, on the night of December 31st, 1999?
",8613635,Huge Brain," Clarification request: Are you the Philip J. Fry from Earth or the Philip J. Fry from Hovering Squidworld 97A?
",11213636,Big Brain," Earth, you fat idiot! Hurry up!
",3313637,Fry,"  Hello? Pizza delivery for ...  ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!
",5913638,Fry," Eurgh! I can't believe how fat I look!  Aw, Nibbler's there. Wait! What?
",7413639,Fry,"  What the--
",1313640,Fry," I-- I don't understand. You made me go in the freezer tube?
",6113641,Computer Voice," Detonation in T-15 seconds.
",2913642,Fry," You little runts froze me! You took away my life!
",5113643,Nibbler,"  We can explain!
",1813644,Fry," No, you can't. Shut your adorable trap!
",4113645,Nibbler,"  We had no choice. You were the only one who could help us. What is one life weighed against the entire universe?
",11513646,Fry,"  But it was my life.
",2213647,Computer Voice," Detonation in two, one. Will the owner of a white Pontiac Firebird-- Oh, never mind. Zero!
",9213648,Big Brain," Well, here we are. Trapped for eternity.
",4213649,Brain #2," We could sing American Pie.
",2913650,Fry," Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those stupid racoons had never brought me to the future.
",8913651,Huge Brain," I have shocking data relevant to this conversation.
",5313652,Big Brain," We don't care, you dope! We're in another universe. You're not in charge anymore.
",8313653,Huge Brain," It is possible for the Philip Fry to resume his life on December 31st, 1999.
",7813654,Fry," Really? I can go back in time?
",3213655,Huge Brain," There is a nexus point between universes at the space-time where you entered the cryogenic tube. You and only you can return there.
",13313656,Big Brain," Interesting. You could stop the Nibblonian from pushing you into the cryogenic tube.
",8613657,Fry," That is interesting. Why?
",2713658,Big Brain," It would be as if you never came to the future. You will have your life back and we will succeed in our plan to understand and destroy the universe.
",15013659,Fry," Everybody wins!
",1713660,Brain #2," The human will be returned to the past!
",4113661,Narrator,"  Meanwhile.
",1313662,Leela," I love rocket skating! But the wait is always so long. Poor Fry once stood in line for six hours just to get me a ticket.
",12313663,Chaz," Six hours? Pft! Sounds like a real nobody! But now it's time for somebody and some chick he's with to go skating.
",11513664,Leela," You reserved the whole rink?
",3013665,Chaz," Yup. Buzzed ahead, let 'em know whose aide was coming by. The mayor's, that's whose.
",8613666,Leela," Oh, Chaz!
",1113667,Sally," Mr. Vogel, I thought we was going skating.
",4413668,Vogel," No, we're not important enough. Everybody just hold hands until the bus driver comes back from his haircut.
",10913669,Leela," Aw, let's let those kids skate with us.
",4113670,Chaz," What? Seriously? I'm trying to impress you with my clout here.
",6413671,Leela," I know, and it's working. But think how much skating would mean to those kids.
",8013672,Nina," We came here instead of eating today.
",3913673,Leela," This may be their only chance to skate in their whole lives. Who are we to say they can't?
",9213674,Chaz," The mayor's aide, and his badge.  Beat it, kids! Come back when you got connections!
",8613675,Vogel," Alright, little ones, back to the orphanarium. You can slide around the gym in your socks.
",9213676,Sally," What socks?
",1313677,Chaz," So am I gonna get lucky tonight or what?
",4213678,Fry," I hope your calculations are correct.
",3913679,Big Brain," Our calculations are always correct. For we are gigantic brains.
",6613680,Brain #2," Initiate space-time transfer.
",3113681,Nibbler," I hereby place an order for one cheese pizza.
",4713682,Panucci,"  One pie, nothing good on it. Name?
",3713683,Nibbler," I-period-C-period-Wiener.
",2713684,Panucci,"  Uh, talk a little louder. It sounds like you got some kind of tiny head on you or something.
",9513685,Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for, uh ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!
",5713686,Fry," Gotcha!
",913687,Nibbler," I don't understand.
",2113688,Fry," Yes, you do! You came back in time to knock me into that freezer and now I came back in time to stop you.
",10713689,Nibbler," I did not come back in time. My people lack that ability.
",5913690,Fry," But ... I know you in the future. I-I cleaned your poop.
",5813691,Nibbler," Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. You will meet me when I'm a thousand years older.
",10813692,Fry," Not if you don't freeze me.
",2913693,Nibbler," Please. Our saviours foresee that in a thousand years, for one moment, the fate of the universe will depend on you. Since you will not live that long I must freeze you now.
",17413694,Fry," Well, why couldn't you just ask me?
",3713695,Nibbler," We were afraid you would refuse.
",3413696,Fry," Of course not. I love the future.
",3513697,Nibbler," Then why are you choking me right now?
",4013698,Fry," Because I don't like being used.
",3413699,Nibbler," Well now it's your choice. Is there nothing in the future worth saving?
",7313700,Fry," Hm. Leela. But she doesn't think much of me.
",4613701,Nibbler," Ah, she must be The Other.
",2813702,Fry," What?
",713703,Nibbler," You must not give up on her. I am stationed on a distant world known as Vergon 6. But, if you return to the future, I will transfer to Earth to give you what help I can.
",17113704,Crowd,"  Ten, nine, eight, seven...
",2913705,Fry," You really think I would have had a chance with Leela?
",5613706,Nibbler," You must choose: The present or the future? To save yourself or to save Leela.
",8013707,Crowd,"  One.
",713708,Fry," Yes! Here I come, future! Oh, no! Wait! I'm gonna get trapped in the Infosphere again! Just remember that Scooty-Puff Jr. sucks.
",13013709,Nibbler," In a thousand years, I'll get right on it.
",4413710,Narrator,"  And so, a thousand years later, Fry once again infiltrated the Infosphere and set off his amazing bomb. Only this time...
",12413711,Nibbler," Thank you for saving the universe, Fry.  Here.
",4813712,Fry," Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour again, just ask.
",5913713,Nibbler," Oh, we will. We will.
",2313714,Fry," Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what happened.
",5113715,Nibbler," Uh, yes. Incidentally, I need to remain undercover so I'm blanking your memory.
",8113716,Fry," Huh. Did everything just taste purple for a second? Oh, well. Let's go home, you dumb poop machine.
",10113717,Leela," Bender, would you do the honours?
",3513718,Bender," With gusto.
",1313719,Fry," Hey, Leela. I guess I got this for you.
",4113720,Leela," Oh. Thank you. You know what, Fry? I don't care if you're not the most important person in the universe. It really makes me happy to see you right now.
",15313721,Fry," Then I am the most important person in the universe.
",5413722,Fry,"  Yes!
",713723,Shatner,"  Shatner's log, airdate ... unknown.
",3813724,Shatner," The impossible has happened. It would take days to recount the events I have witnessed. So, settle in. It all began--
",11913725,Zapp," Quiet, you! This court martial is now in session. The honourably sexy Zapp Brannigan residing. Bring in the accused.
",11813726,George Takei," Oh, my!
",913727,Zapp," Philip J. Fry, you stand accused of travelling to the forbidden planet, Omega 3, a crime punishable by 12 concurrent death sentences. Do you understand the charges?
",16613728,Kif," One beep for ""yes"", two beeps for ""no"".
",4113729,Zapp," ""Yes"". So noted. Do you plead guilty?  Double ""yes"". Guilty! I will now carry out the punishment. Kif, my gun.
",11213730,Leela," Wait! He pled ""not guilty"".
",2913731,Zapp," Order!  Order in the court! Very well then, Mr. Fry. Please recount the events that led you to be guilty.
",10713732,Leela," The Professor said he was taking a brief nap, so we only have time for six movies.
",8413733,Bender," Let's take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them.
",6213734,Fry," You know what movies average out to be really good? The first six Star Trek movies!
",8513735,Clerk,"  Everybody hit the deck!
",2613736,Leela,"  Sh! Those words are forbidden!
",3313737,Fry," What words? Star Trek?
",2413738,Leela," Sh!
",513739,Zoidberg," Shut your gills!
",1813740,Bender," That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide him!
",4413741,Zapp," The court is intrigued. Perhaps we could hear more about these forbidden words from someone with a sexily seductive voice.
",12413742,George Takei," With pleasure. You see, the show was banned after the Star Trek wars.
",7113743,Zapp," You mean the vast migration of Star Wars fans?
",4813744,Nichols," No, that was the Star Wars trek.  By the 23rd century, Star Trek fandom had evolved from a loose association of nerds with skin problems into a full-blown religion.
",16613745,Priest,"  And Scotty beamed them to the Klingon ship where they would be no Tribble at all.
",8413746,Congregation,"  All power to the engines.
",2813747,Nichols," As country after country fell under its influence, world leaders became threatened by the movements power.  And so the Trekkies were executed in the manner most befitting virgins.
",18113748,Man #1,"  He's dead, Jim!  He's dead, Jim!  He's dead, Jim!
",5213749,Nichols," Finally, the sacred texts were banned.
",4013750,George Takei," The last copies of the 79 episodes and six movies were dumped on the forbidden world, Omega 3, along with that blooper reel where the door doesn't close all the way.
",16713751,Nimoy," Thus, Star Trek was forever scoured from human memory.
",5613752,Bender," Another classic science-fiction show cancelled before its time.
",6513753,Zapp," I've never heard of such a brutal and shocking injustice that I cared so little about. Next witness.
",10213754,Kif," Bender the robot, please take the stand.
",4213755,Fry," She's all yours, buddy!
",2513756,Bender," I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good.
",7313757,Zapp," Please use the beeps.
",2313758,Fry," Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago. I can't believe your show was banned.
",10513759,Nimoy," I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
",5413760,Fry," You know. 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 good ones.
",5013761,Nimoy," Oh, really, I've done too many things to remember one particular TV series. But if-if you want to discuss my books of poetry--
",12813762,Fry," Come on! Remember that episode where you got high on spores and smacked Kirk around?
",8613763,Nimoy," No. Perhaps you're thinking of my one man show about Vincent van Spock-- Uh, uh, I mean van Gogh! Damn!
",10513764,Fry," Aha! You can't escape it!
",2713765,Nimoy,"  Oh, you're right, I can't.
",2913766,Fry," Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK, I outwitted you, but--
",6313767,Nimoy,"  No, it's my fellow cast members. 300 years ago they left Earth behind.
",7313768,Shatner," This planet doesn't appreciate us anymore, Leonard.
",5313769,Nimoy," Bill, you are, and always shall be, my friend. But I just signed a six-month lease on my apartment. I can't walk away from a commitment like that.
",14813770,Shatner," Very well, my friend.
",2313771,Nimoy,"  Why did the world turn it's back on our obvious greatness?
",6113772,Fry," I'm literally angry with rage! Your co-stars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see. Come on!
",14113773,Nimoy," Oh!
",513774,Frakes," Yes! Front row!
",1713775,Leela," You can't go to Omega 3; it's forbidden! I forbid you!
",5613776,Fry," But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future.
",7913777,Leela," But it's set 800 years in the past!
",3713778,Bender," Yeah, why is this so important to you?
",4013779,Fry," 'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people, whether they be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly, when I didn't have any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did.
",21013780,Leela," Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone.
",7013781,Bender," I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, of course.
",5213782,Leela," We're entering the Omega system.
",3413783,Computer Voice," Warning: You are now in forbidden space.
",4213784,Bender," Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they gonna do, write a letter?  Ooh, I'm so scared!
",8813785,Leela," I've lost control of the ship!
",3213786,Fry," Oh, dip!
",1013787,Nimoy," Dip, indeed!
",1413788,Fry," It's all stuff from that forbidden show.
",4213789,Nimoy," So many cardboard sets, so many memories. If only the others--
",6413790,Shatner," I guess that's my cue.
",2413791,Nimoy," Bill!
",713792,Shatner," L-Dog!
",813793,Nimoy,"  Hey! This is wonderful!
",2613794,Shatner," Oh, man.
",1013795,Nimoy," I feel like hugging you.
",2613796,Shatner," Well I would except you have no body!  And we're both men.
",6013797,Nimoy," Nichelle! George! Walter! DeForest!  Welshie!
",4713798,Fry," Welshie?
",1013799,Nichols," We did some musical reunion specials in the 2200's but the guy who played Scotty had trouble yodelling.
",10513800,George Takei," Ever since then, Welshie has been a welcome participant in our escapades.
",7513801,Fry," I can't believe it! How'd you all end up here?
",4813802,Shatner," We were on our way to Welshie's cousin's house to stay in the guest room when our ship was pulled down to this planet and crashed, just like yours.
",14913803,Koenig," When we woke up, we had these bodies.
",3913804,Fry," Say it in Russian!
",2013805,Koenig," Ven vee voke up vee had these wodies.
",3913806,Fry," Now say ""nuclear wessels""!
",2813807,Koenig," No!
",513808,George Takei," You'll love it here. Everything is provided for us, and we never age. Check out these abs!
",9213809,Bender," Yowza!
",813810,Leela," But who's doing all this for you?
",3513811,Shatner," You know, we never thought about it. We're famous celebrities -- we're used to this sort of treatment.
",10413812,Melllvar," It is I!
",1013813,Bender," Whoa! What a cheesy effect!
",2913814,Melllvar," I am not an effect! You doubt my power?
",4113815,Bender," I do.
",713816,Welshie,"  Aye!
",713817,Fry,"  Welshie!
",1113818,Zapp," This court will now hear some very sensual testimony from this court's ex-lover, Turanga Leela.
",9713819,Leela," Go  yourself.
",1513820,Melllvar," Behold another power, different from the one you saw earlier.
",6313821,Nimoy," Hey, a body! Buff, tan. Yeah, this is mine, alright!
",5413822,Fry," Alright, you gas, what's the deal?
",3613823,Melllvar," Centuries ago, the videotaped adventures of the Enterprise crew rained down upon my planet. Over and over, I watched them. Especially the five with the energy beings. I am Melllvar! Seer of the tapes, knower of the episodes! Tremble before my encyclopaedic knowledge of Star Trek!
",28213824,Fry," Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me!
",6213825,Melllvar," I beg to differ.  Long have I waited for the one who played Spock. At last, we can begin.
",9113826,Fry," Cool! A Star Trek convention!
",3113827,Nimoy," Uh, Melllvar, can you give us some idea of how long this is going to last?
",7613828,Melllvar," Until time stops.
",1913829,Leela," What?
",713830,Shatner," He can't do this!
",1913831,Nimoy," You can't be serious!
",2313832,Melllvar," Now, we have a full schedule of events--
",4213833,Bender," Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?
",4213834,Koenig," Good question!
",1613835,Melllvar," No, you have to stay even longer.
",3513836,Melllvar," Um, uh, sign it to Melllvar. ""Melllvar"" has three ""L's"".
",5813837,George Takei," I think I've done enough conventions to know how to spell ""Melllvar"".
",7113838,Bender," Say ""nerd""!
",1313839,All," Nerd!
",713840,Shatner,"  I'm Slim Shady,
Yes, I'm the real Shady,
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating,
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up.
",16913841,Koenig," How can you do a spoken-word version of a rap song?
",5313842,Melllvar," He found a way.
",1713843,Leela," For one hundred quatloos: Who did the captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?
",7113844,Shatner,"  Khaaan!
",1013845,Fry," Uh ... Khan?
",1413846,Leela," Correct.
",1013847,Melllvar," My button has broken. The trivia contest has ended. I-I now have a surprise. You will perform a fan script, written by the ultimate Trek fan.
",14313848,Fry," You have my fan script?
",2513849,Melllvar," I meant me! Melllvar is the ultimate fan!
",4313850,Fry,"  Oh, I was confused because the scoreboard says something different.
",7013851,Melllvar," Trivia contest over! Take your scripts!  We have limited rehearsal time. Now, I didn't make enough copies of the script, so George and Walter will have to share.
",16313852,Leela," Uh, you probably don't want us to see you rehearsing, or it'll give away the ending.
",8613853,Melllvar," That's right! The ending must not be ruined.
",4613854,Leela," We'll go wait in the ship.
",2813855,Melllvar," OK.
",513856,Fry," Not till I get my 600 quatloos!
",3313857,Fry," This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned them there.
",5613858,Bender," I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about it.
",4413859,Leela," I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, but what are we supposed to do?
",7213860,Fry," Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy.
",11213861,Leela," Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum structure.
",16413862,Bender," Like putting too much air in a balloon!
",4113863,Fry," Of course! It's so simple!
",2813864,Shatner,"  Alas, my ship, whom I love like a woman, is ... disabled.  Oh, Lord!
",7113865,Nimoy,"  Fascinating, Captain, and logical too, that we need some help.
",6513866,George Takei,"  Look, Captain, Melllvar will help us.
",4013867,Koenig,"  Keptin, I wope he will welp our ... vessel.
",4613868,Melllvar," Wessel!  You're not acting hard enough!
",4113869,Nimoy," Melllvar, you have to respect your actors. When I directed Star Trek IV I got a magnificent performance out of Bill because I respected him so much.
",15013870,Shatner," And when I directed Star Trek V I got a magnificent performance out of me, because I respected me so much!
",10813871,Bender,"  OK! I'm done re-kafoobling the energy motron ... or whatever.
",6413872,Leela," Fire!
",713873,Nichols,"  My, what a handsome energy creature you are. I love you.  Hey, you wrote it!
",7913874,Leela," It's not working! He's drawing straight from our weapons.
",5913875,Fry," Like a balloon and ... something bad happens.
",4713876,Bender," Yup!
",613877,Leela," So, uh, how's rehearsal going?
",3213878,Melllvar," Lousy. Here I've been admiring a bunch of actors while you, a crew of genuine space heroes, risked your lives to save them.
",12513879,Nimoy," Hey! We've done heroic things too.
",3613880,Nichols," Yeah! In the third season I kissed Shatner!
",4513881,Melllvar," Silence! My whole world has turned upside-down. I have but one option.
",7213882,Koenig," Keep them and let us go?
",2613883,Melllvar," No! To determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion I shall pit you together against each other in armed combat ... to the death!
",14013884,Bender," Where'd you get an idiotic idea like that?
",4413885,Melllvar," Episodes 19, 46, 56 and 77.
",2913886,Fry," Great list. Except, you forgot episode 66!
",4413887,Melllvar," I was getting to that one!
",2813888,Zapp," So Melllvar ordered a battle to the death. I assume no one survived.
",7013889,Leela," Can we get on with this? My foot's getting tired!
",5113890,Melllvar," This will be your standard battle to the death. The only weapons: Whatever you can find. But I warn you, do nothing until I have signalled the start of combat. OK, start.
",17213891,Koenig," I don't have much experience at fighting -- except with you guys.
",6713892,Shatner," I have an idea. Wasn't there an episode where I threw my shoe at the enemy?
",7713893,Nimoy," You mean Doohan?
",1813894,Shatner," Whoever it was, I did it like this.
",3713895,George Takei," Ow!
",513896,Shatner," My foot's cold!
",1713897,Leela," There. We can make these into spears.
",3913898,Fry," And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows.
",8513899,Bender," And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw!  That was fun!
",7213900,Nichols," What if I distract them with my famous fan dance?
",5113901,Shatner," Oh, that's good, good, good, good. And then, George, you give them a karate chop!
",8313902,George Takei," I find that offensive. Just because I'm of Japanese ancestry you assume I know karate. Have I ever led you to believe I've studied karate?
",14013903,Shatner," Well, no, but you never talk about yourself.
",4613904,George Takei,"  Maybe if you showed a little interest.
",4113905,Fry," Well, here goes nothing.
",2613906,Nichols,"  Hello, boys!
",1513907,Bender," Whoa!
",713908,George Takei," Hi-yah!
",913909,Shatner," There's no right way to hit a woman.
",3813910,Leela," Then do it the wrong way.
",2713911,Shatner," Fine. Yah!
",1213912,Leela," Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!
",3313913,Shatner," See you in h--
",1613914,Bender," Come on, Walter!
",1813915,Nimoy," Take that!
",1213916,Fry," It hurts!
",1113917,Nimoy," Let's see if this actually works!  Hm.  Ow! Ow! Ow!
",5313918,Koenig," My face!
",1013919,George Takei," Ow! My face too!
",1813920,Shatner," May I?  Oh!
",1313921,Melllvar," Excellent! Excellent!
",2313922,Shatner," Leela, please. This is exactly what Melllvar wants. We're just pawns in his diabolical game of checkers. Can't we resolve our differences some other way?
",15513923,Melllvars Mother," Melllvar! Dinner time!
",2413924,Melllvar," Aw, but Mom, I'm playing with my collectables!
",4813925,Melllvars Mother," Now!
",613926,Fry," All this time we thought he was a powerful super-being, yet he was just a child.
",8213927,Melllvars Mother," He's not a child, he's 34!
",2813928,Bender," Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this for years!
",5213929,Fry," Bender, wait! This is our chance to escape, before Melllvar comes back. But we all need to work together.
",10713930,Shatner," I love you so much!
",2113931,Nimoy," Hello?
",813932,Fry," We've decided to work together.
",3313933,Nimoy," Uh, so did they.
",1813934,Shatner," Now, how do we escape?
",2413935,Leela," We can't use our ship; we have life support but the engines are wrecked.
",7413936,George Takei," Ironic, because our engines work but our life support systems don't.
",7013937,Leela," Hey, if your engines work--
",2913938,George Takei," And your life support systems work--
",3813939,Fry," Stop! You're just goin' around in circles!  Think, Fry, think! Everyone's depending on you.
",9313940,Leela," We're too heavy. You guys need to lose some weight, fast!
",5913941,Fry," Look, Leonard, we're light enough to keep the tapes! Isn't that great?
",7213942,Nimoy," I'm living in a gefilte fish jar.
",3513943,Fry," We did it!
",1213944,Fry," Melllvar's got a spaceship!
",2913945,Melllvar,"  Yes, in mint condition. And you made me take it out of the package!
",7013946,Leela," The Nimbus! We're saved!
",2613947,Zapp,"  You're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded.
",4613948,Zapp," So I boarded you, eh? What happened next?
",4313949,Leela," You started this stupid court martial. Now if you don't mind, we're still fighting Melllvar!
",9413950,Leela," One more hit and we're done for!
",3413951,George Takei," Let's take 'em out with us. Do you guys have a self-destruct code? Like ""destruct sequence 1-A, 2-B, 3--""
",10713952,Bender," Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!
",4313953,Melllvar,"  If I can't have the original cast of Star Trek, no one will! Prepare to die!
",7913954,Fry," Wait! If they mean that much to you, why do you wanna kill them?
",6613955,Melllvar,"  Because I ... I ... I dunno what I'd do without them.
",5613956,Fry," Melllvar, you can't let a TV show be your whole life. You can do anything you want. Look at Walter Koenig: After Star Trek, he became an actor.
",14513957,Koenig," Not just an actor, but a well-rounded person, with my own friends and credit cards and keys.
",9413958,Melllvar,"  Well, I guess I could move out of my parents' basement ... maybe get a temp job.
",8313959,Fry," Whoa, whoa! One step at a time.
",3313960,Melllvar,"  I thank you, Fry. You know, you and I are of a kind. In a different reality I could have called you ""friend"".
",11213961,Fry," Episode 10, Balance of Terror.
",3213962,Melllvar,"  More like episode nine, loser! In your face! Victory is mine!
",6413963,Shatner," I wonder, my friends, was he really such an evil energy gas?
",6213964,Nichols," He did give us eternal youth.
",3113965,Koenig," 24-hour Laundromat.
",2113966,George Takei," A full assortment of rum, both spiced and regular.
",5213967,Nimoy," Truly, it was a paradise.
",2713968,Fry," And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan.
",7113969,Shatner," Let's get the hell outta here!
",3213970,Bender," A hush comes over the crowd. The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk as he swings!  Oh, he slices! Into the water! Oh, man!   Boy, I tell you, buddy!
",16513971,Farnsworth," Bad news, everyone. You're not good enough to go on your next mission.
",7213972,Fry," Hooray!
",913973,Bender," Not good enough!
",1813974,Leela," Why? Says who?
",1613975,Farnsworth," Because. And says me. It's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew. And you're not nearly as good as them.
",12413976,Fry," Woo-hoo!
",1013977,Bender," We live to suck another day!
",3013978,Leela," We're just as good as any of those other crews you sent to their deaths. What's the mission?
",9413979,Farnsworth," Collecting honey. Ordinary honey.
",3513980,Leela," That doesn't sound so dangerous.
",3413981,Farnsworth," This is no ordinary honey! It's produced by vicious space bees. A single sting of their hideous neuro-toxin can cause instant death.
",13413982,Hermes," And that's if you're not allergic. You don't wanna know what happens then. Oh, no, no. God, no!
",9713983,Farnsworth," Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano.
",7713984,Hermes," I didn't want to know!
",2413985,Farnsworth," These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly.
",5913986,Fry," Larger than an American sedan?  How big is the honeycomb?
",5913987,Hermes," Honeycomb's big. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
",3613988,Bender," It's not small?
",1713989,Hermes," No, no, no.
",1313990,Leela," It'll take more than deadly, deadly bees to keep us from doing our job. Come on, boys.
",8813991,Fry," But, Leela, we're no good.
",2813992,Leela," Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of disappointing myself.
",7013993,Fry," I'm not scared of that at all.
",3213994,Leela," Now, bees communicate by dancing.
",3513995,Fry," Like my parents! Oh, wait, that was hitting.
",4613996,Leela," So this language cartridge will let you distract them.
",5613997,Bender," Ah, good. I often have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance.   You stink. Bender's great. Deal with it.
",13113998,Leela," Bender, quick! Waggle something!
",3413999,Bender," Uh ...  Hello, fellow bees. How's the abdomen? Swollen with nectar, I trust?
",7814000,Bee #1,"  Duh!
",714001,Fry," Leela, let's turn back. There's absolutely no shame in wussing out.
",6914002,Leela," Relax. Everything'll be fine.
",3114003,Fry," Oh, my God! The old Planet Express ship.
",4214004,Leela," There's the black box.
",2414005,Man #1,"  Captain, the bees have us surrounded! Oh, the Professor was right. We're not as good as his old crew!
",10414006,Captain,"  Well I aim to prove him wrong. It'll take more than a few deadly, deadly bees to--   Oh, Lord!
",9714007,Leela," Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much static.
",4614008,Bender," Ew!
",514009,Leela," We found it! The honeycomb hideout.
",3714010,Fry," Hey, what's this goop?
",2414011,Leela," Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.
",4114012,Fry," Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How come nothing humans make tastes good?  Help! I can't swim in jelly, as far as I know!
",12314013,Leela," Look!  It's a baby queen! Aw, she's so cute! You adorable wittle, itty-bitty, fuzzy-wuzzy--
",9314014,Fry," Leela! Stop bonding and let's go! I got jelly in my underpants!
",6514015,Leela," I'm taking this bee with us. With a queen we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch and we'll go.
",13714016,Bender,"  Pick up the pace, lady! I'm sick of shaking my booty for these fat jerks.  I didn't mean you're all fat. Just fatso there.
",12514017,Bee #1,"  He insulted our fat queen.
",2914018,Queen,"  You try keeping your figure after 10,000 kids.
",4914019,Leela," This is where we distinguish ourselves from the last crew. Activate emergency high-speed self-contained escape pack crisis response unit. Quick!
",14614020,Leela,"  Good luck, Bender!
",2114021,Bender," I'm back, baby!
",1714022,Fry," We made it! We're alive!
",2614023,Leela," Burn on that, old crew! The only things they did better than us were suck and die.
",8414024,Fry," Leela, we got lucky this time. But you should be more careful. I don't want anything to happen to you.
",10414025,Leela," Thanks, but I can look out for myself. Frankly, I can smell danger a mile away.
",8114026,Fry," Look out!  You want her, you're gonna have to go through me!
",6214027,Leela," You call that a wound? That's a boo-boo tops. But thanks for trying to save me, Fry.   Fry?!  He's... he's dead!
",11414028,Bender,"  Who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now?
",6314029,Leela,"  It was all my fault! He died because of me!
",4614030,Farnsworth,"  No, no, no, no, no, no.   I'm lying to make her feel better!
",6314031,Labarbara," Husband, can't you go anywhere without lighting something up?
",6314032,Hermes," It's an old Jamaican accounting tradition. We burn his timecard. That way his zombie doesn't come back looking for his final paycheck.
",13614033,Amy," He looks so natural. It's funny to think he's clammed full of sawdust and preservatives.
",9014034,Zoidberg," I only wish I could have removed the stinger.
",4714035,Changstein el Gamahl," I barely knew Philip. But, as a clergyman, I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
",11114036,Hermes," Soothe us with sweet lies.
",2814037,Changstein el Gamahl," It may comfort you to know Fry's death took only 15 seconds. Yet the pain was so intense that it felt to him like 15 years. And it goes without saying it caused him to empty his bowels.  We now commend Fry's body to the ages.
",22714038,Amy," He's walking on sunshine now.
",3114039,Farnsworth," This makes me the oldest member of my family.
",4714040,Kug," Him do good snu-snu.
",2214041,Bender," All those times I said ""Kill all humans,"" I'd always whisper ""except one"". Fry was that one.  And I never told him so!
",12014042,Terry,"  Farewell, from the world of tomorrow!
",4014043,Leela,"  They say a spoonful of space honey helps ease the pain.  Mmm... It's good.  I feel funny. Ha-ha funny!
",10514044,Fry," Leela?
",814045,Leela," Fry? I thought you were dead.
",3114046,Fry," Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the accident I couldn't do this!
",6914047,Leela," Impressive! But it does sorta support my you-are-dead theory.
",6314048,Fry," Then I'll prove I'm alive, by telling you something only I could know.  There's a surprise for you in my locker. I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left.
",16514049,Leela," It's too beautiful to open. Can I open it?
",4414050,Fry," Sure. There's just one thing I want you to do.
",4814051,Leela," What?
",714052,Fry," I want you to wake up.
",2414053,Leela," Wake up? But I'm not--
",2414054,Leela," In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in his locker. If it's true then he must still exist in some form.
",11014055,Farnsworth," Of course he still exists: As a frozen corpse in outer space!  Oh, I made myself sad.
",8714056,Leela," Well, here goes.
",1814057,Zoidberg," Bupkis!
",914058,Bender," Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped give me closure.
",8814059,Leela," Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?
",6514060,Bender," No. Nothing. Not at all. No way, JosÃ©!  Here it is.
",5314061,Leela," You took this from Fry's locker?
",3414062,Bender," Hey, the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing.
",6014063,Leela," That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams.
",7514064,Farnsworth," Bull pies!
",1214065,Farnsworth," Lay down here and we'll do some tests. If Fry is out there then Leela's brain could be acting as a five-pound Ouija board.
",12414066,Leela," Is this some sort of brain scanner?
",3714067,Farnsworth," Some sort, yes. In France it's called a guillotine.
",5314068,Leela," Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?
",6014069,Farnsworth," Yes, easily.
",1414070,Bender," Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like Julia Roberts?
",8614071,Farnsworth," Well, I suppose there's a slim--  I don't believe it!
",5514072,Leela," What is it? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something?
",6414073,Farnsworth," No. According to this gizmometer, Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back. Remarkable!
",9114074,Leela," But ... my dream. Your science can't unprove that! How could I have known the gift was in Fry's locker?
",10514075,Hermes," Easy! He told you about it before he died and your grief-roasted mind blocked it out.
",8714076,Leela," Are you saying I'm going crazy?
",3314077,Farnsworth," No, no! No one's saying that. But I'm certainly thinking it loudly.
",6914078,Fry," Hi, Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, even if you can't hear me. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
",11614079,Leela," Shut up! I can hear you. The Professor says you're just a dream.
",6614080,Fry," Oh, yeah?  Could a dream take you dancing in a Venusian garden?
",6514081,Leela," Well, yes, technically. But it's still very sweet of you.
",5914082,Fry," Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hyperion?
",7314083,Leela," Oh, Fry! You must be alive; I've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before.
",9914084,Fry," Here, take my jacket. You look a little cold.
",4714085,Leela," Thank you. It's all so beautiful. I forgot how many hundreds of degrees below zero it must be. I just wish I could convince the others you're alive.
",15014086,Fry," You can. All you have to do is wake up.
",4114087,Leela," No, no! Don't say that! This is real!
",3914088,Leela," Not another dream!  Fry's jacket! The one he was buried in! My dream was real! He's alive!
",9214089,Petunia,"  Quit your bragging! My boyfriend's alive too!  Not 'nymore!
",6214090,Bender," That's better!
",1614091,Leela," Fry's alive! I have proof!
",2814092,Amy," No way!
",914093,Farnsworth," You lie!
",1014094,Bender," You do not!
",1314095,Hermes," I'm from Jamaica, the ""Show Me"" island. So show me you're blowing it out your fanny.
",8614096,Leela," But he gave me his jacket. Look.
",3414097,Farnsworth," That's not Fry's jacket. Fry's jacket is red. That's your jacket. An off-the-rack, lime green affair.
",10314098,Leela," But Fry-- His jacket-- And when I woke up it was on me.
",5714099,Hermes," You're under a lot of guilt stress, Leela. Here, work it off.
",6314100,Leela,"  I am not under stress, damnit!
",3314101,Amy,"  Everything's going to be alright, Leela.
",4314102,Leela," What?
",714103,Amy," I said everything's going to be alright.
",4214104,Leela," Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.
",3914105,Bender," A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita. And she's a screw!
",6514106,Leela," I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey.
",6914107,Farnsworth," You've been taking space honey? Be careful, you purple-haired imbecile!
",7314108,Zoidberg," One spoonful calms you down. Two spoonfuls help you sleep. But three spoonfuls and you'll go into a sleep so deep you'll never wake up. Never!
",14414109,Hermes,"  Never!
",914110,Bender,"  Never!
",914111,Leela," One spoonful to calm me down.  OK, I've got a pretty good calm going! Two spoonfuls to help me sleep.  Uh-oh, still awake. I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt.  Oh, my gosh! I'd better get a sponge.  Fry?  Is that you? I don't need a sponge!
",24714112,Fry," Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
",5414113,Farnsworth," Incredible! According to the gizmometer, Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled on the couch, it recombined with trace amounts of Fry's hair and skin--
",22914114,Bender," And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!
",4414115,Farnsworth," Yes, Bender, thank you. In short, the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being.
",13114116,Fry," Neat!
",714117,Bender," This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again.  Let's go get hammered!
",9514118,Zoidberg," I should warn you, I'm a mean drunk.
",3814119,Leela," Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you.
",3714120,Fry," Me too.
",914121,Leela," Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad. But now everything is alright.
",8714122,Fry," Uh, not everything.
",2114123,Leela," What? What do you mean?
",2514124,Fry," You have to wake up.
",2214125,Leela," Wake up? Oh, no! No! It can't be!
",3514126,Leela," Pooh!
",714127,Leela," I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive. But when I'm awake, my mind plays tricks on me.
",11114128,Hermes," Oh, take it easy, Leela.
",2614129,Amy," In every life we have some trouble.
",3714130,Bender," But when you worry, you make it double.
",4114131,Amyand Bender,"  Don't worry! Bee happy!
",2614132,Farnsworth,"  The landlord says your rent is late.
",3914133,Hermes,"  He might have to litigate.
",2914134,Bender,"  But don't worry!
",1914135,Bee #1,"  Bee--
",814136,Farnsworth,"  Happy!
",914137,Zoidberg,"  Ain't got no cash,
Ain't got no style,
Ladies vomit when I smile,
But does Zoidberg worry?
Feh! You wish!
",10814138,Bee #1,"  Bee--
",814139,Zoidberg,"  Happy!
",914140,Hermes," Don't worry now, Amy!
",2314141,Amy," OK! I'm happy!
",1614142,Bender," Take us home, Bender!  Don't worry!
",3714143,Bee #1,"  Bee--
",814144,Bender,"  Happy!
",914145,Leela," Uh, were you just singing?
",2814146,Bender," No, I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing. Court order.
",7514147,Leela," I'll find Fry's coffin, get his corpse and keep it under my mattress to remind me that he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane.
",13614148,Leela," OK, it's just an ordinary coffin. Containing my ordinary dead friend, who I killed.
",8514149,Leela," What happened? Why am I in my apartment?
",4214150,"Farnsworth, Zoidberg, Hermes, Amyand Bender","   You killed Fry! You killed Fry! You killed Fry ...!
",5514151,Leela," Stop it! Stop it!
",1914152,Bender," You killed Fry!
",1714153,Leela," OK, I'm insane! But I'm still sane enough to know it.  The only time I feel alright is in my dreams, with you.  Three spoonfuls. Then I can dream forever.  One. Two  Here goes. Goodbye, waking world.
",20114154,Frys Photo," Leela! No!  Listen to me, you don't want to lie in bed like a vegetable and do nothing the rest of your life. I've tried it. Bedsores hurt!
",14114155,Leela,"  Then what am I s'posed to do?
",3214156,Frys Photo," Fight it!
",1114157,Leela,"  I can't!
",1114158,Frys Photo," You can! The Leela I know doesn't give up this easily.
",5614159,Leela," OK. I'll try.  Go away!
",2514160,Frys Photo," I don't know if you can hear me, Leela, but there's something I wanna tell you. I love you.
",9314161,Leela,"  I'm so scared, Fry. I don't know what to do.
",4714162,Frys Photo," Just wake up, Leela. Please. Just wake up.
",4414163,Leela,"  I don't understand what you mean!
",3614164,Fry,"  Just wake up. Please. Just wake up, Leela.
",4514165,Leela," Fry. You're alive!
",2014166,Fry," Leela! You're awake!
",2214167,Leela," Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop waking me.  Where am I?
",6414168,Fry," In the hospital. The ambulance took you here right after the bee stung you.
",7714169,Leela," But the bee stung you. It barely touched me.
",4614170,Fry," The stinger went right through me and you got all the poison. My new spleen came from a guy who liked to motorcycle.
",11814171,Hermes," Sweet three-toed sloth of ice planet Hoth! She's awake!
",5714172,Bender," You were in the best coma I've ever seen!
",4314173,Amy," The doctor said you'd never wake up.
",3814174,Leela," Really? How long was I out?
",2914175,Amy," Two weeks. Fry never left your side for a minute.
",5114176,Zoidberg," And he talked non-stop. Like a parrot of the sea, he was!
",5914177,Fry," I though that maybe if you heard a familiar voice it might help keep your mind together. But who knows if it really got through.
",13014178,Leela," It got through, Fry.  It got through.
",3914179,Leela,"  You could really use a shower.
",3314180,Fry,"  You too!
",1114181,TV Commentator,"  Welcome to the games of the 3004 Earth Olympiad. Continuing this network's tradition of sports-casting excellence.  Celebrity Ape Fight will return next week at its regular time.
",18114182,Fry," So who should I root for? America or one of those countries I learned about at the food court?
",9614183,Amy," How 'bout those guys?
",2314184,Leela," No, they're from the Republic of French Stereotypes. Everybody hates them.
",7614185,Farnsworth," Oh, let's go check on Hermes. All this inspiring multi-culturalism is angrying up my blood.  Sweden? I don't think so!
",12014186,Hermes," Go on, stick, touch me! Can't do it!
",3814187,Labarbara," Husband, you haven't been an Olympic-class limbo-er for 20 years! Quit lying to your podgy self.
",9814188,Leela," It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team without you.
",8214189,Amy," Yeah, isn't that basically all Jamaicans do?
",4614190,Hermes," Jamaicans have other interests. Which is why the limbo team got detained at the airport.
",9014191,Labarbara," That's when they begged my husband to step in and make an ass out of himself.
",7914192,Hermes," And I said I'd try my very best.
",3414193,Fry," But have they seen your ... y'know ... physique, since the old days?
",7014194,Hermes," I described it to them on the phone ... using a series of artful euphemisms.
",7814195,Farnsworth," Don't worry. The fat pig will do fine thanks to this flabbo-dynamic spandex bodysuit I've designed.  It redistributes his weight, shifting his centre of gravity closer to his knees.
",18314196,Hermes," Ooh, that's snug!  Oh, those haven't descended in years.
",5814197,Farnsworth," Now that's a limbo-er's body!
",3114198,Labarbara," Look at that fine Jamaican bacon!
",3514199,Bender," Shut up, Zoidberg! The robot bending events are starting.  Something tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals.  Wow! That guy must be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams of glory died before they began.
",22814200,Zoidberg," Welcome to my life!
",2114201,Female Announcer #1,"  Athletes, please take your lanes for the men's 500 metre limbo.
",6614202,Barbados Slim," Hermes Conrad, is that you inside that dumpy little fat man?
",6214203,Hermes," Barbados Slim! What are you doing here? Last time I heard you were in Barbados.
",8114204,Barbados Slim," Yes and I be going back there with a gold medal draped around my elegant Caribbean shoulders.
",9514205,Hermes," Your body may be as perfectly-sculpted as it was 20 years ago when you whupped my fat ass every time we met.  But today, I feel lucky.
",13614206,Barbados Slim," I see you're still able to limbo under the bar of fashion sense!
",6614207,Hermes," That's it, Barbados Slim. You've gone one toke over the line!
",6314208,Man #1," Limbo-ers, on your marks. Get rubbery. Limbo!
",4714209,Commentator,"  There they go, and Barbados Slim takes an early lead. God, I hope he wins.  What's this? Hermes Conrad is closing the gap. He's limbo-ed out of retirement and straight into my heart. I say go to hell, Barbados Slim!
",21814210,Farnsworth,"  Go, bodysuit, go!
",2014211,Zoidberg,"  Go!
",614212,Bender,"  C'mon!
",914213,Labarbara,"  C'mon, Hermes, beat that mahogany god!
",4114214,Commentator,"  It's Barbados, then Conrad. Conrad pulls ahead!  And Conrad is disqualified! Barbados Slim, my hero, takes the gold!
",11914215,Labarbara," Aw, there, there, Hermes.  You did your best. If I'd wanted a human Adonis for a husband, I'd have stayed married to Barbados Slim.
",13314216,Bender," Well, enough about Hermes. I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending, the thing I was built to do. I'm so embarrassed. I wish everybody else was dead.
",15714217,Female Announcer #1,"  Up next, the Fembot bending competition.
",4314218,Bender," Fembots?  Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events! But the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace.
",13414219,Bender," What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from, uh ... Robonia! Coilette's a chick's name!
",11514220,Official," Yes but ""Robonia"" sounds like something somebody made up on the spot.
",7114221,Bender," Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?
",5214222,Commentator,"  And it's straight! Coilette wins!
",3614223,Commentator,"  Another gold medal for the spunky maid from Robonia.
",5514224,Commentator,"  A perfect bend and a flawless entry. No splash at all!  Perfect scores! A record five gold medals for Coilette!
",11414225,Bender," I'm great! Everybody else sucks! Except that guy Bender. He's really somethin'!
",8114226,Female Announcer #1,"  All medallists report for gender testing.
",4414227,Leela," You actually thought they'd let you walk away without an engine oil sex check?
",8014228,Bender,"  Oh, God, I'm not gonna get my medals! They're all I have to remember my Olympic career.  Wait, I've got it! Professor, make a woman out of me!
",14514229,Farnsworth," Oh, I think we should just stay friends.
",4214230,Bender," I don't need friends. I need a sex change operation and give it to me now!
",7614231,Farnsworth," Bender, a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure. Replacing your testosteroil with Fembot lubricants can cause wild mood swings. And the effects may be irreversible. Well, let's get started!
",20714232,Leela," No, you can't!
",1614233,Amy," If you have even the slightest respect for the dignity of women--
",6714234,Bender," Pft.
",614235,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, ladies, but I must do this. Not for you, not for Bender, but for the proud people of Robonia!
",10614236,Bender,"  C'mon!
",914237,Fry," I can't watch this 'cause it's creepy and wrong and sick. However, I will watch out of curiosity.
",9914238,Farnsworth,"  Quiet!  I'm about to begin the process of reshaping Bender's body into a tender, delicate form.
",9814239,Farnsworth," Draining male oil.  Infusing female oil.  Removing item.
",5814240,Robot #1," We can't wait for Coilette any longer, damnit. I have to get home to watch The Zombie Osbournes.
",9814241,Coilette," I'm ready for my test now, boys.
",3414242,Coilette,"  Hail, hail, Robonia. A land I didn't make up.
",4814243,Coilette,"  Ooh, yeah! Come on, baby! Boom!
",3414244,Coilette," Oh, yeah, baby! C'mon! Work your cans! That's it! Shake it out!
",6514245,Leela," I don't know which I'm more: Enraged or disgusted.
",5214246,Coilette," I'm just out there making us ladies look good.
",4814247,Amy," Snuh-uh! You're making us look like jerks in front of the other genders.
",7414248,Fry," But you're not really a lady anyway. Right?
",4514249,Coilette," Of course not.
",1614250,Farnsworth," Dear Lord! A coaster! The Femmzoil must be sachet-ing girlishly into your processor.
",8614251,Coilette," Then change me back. My breasts are keeping me awake at night anyway.  Hello? What? A guest spot on Late Night With Humorbot 5.0? I'd love to!  My own limo? No I don't have my own limo. You'd better send one.  I need a rain check on that nad-swap, Professor. I'm going on TV. C'mon, Fry. Help me pick out a pantsuit.
",31814252,Humorbot 5.0," So, Calculon, do you want to set up this clip from All My Circuits?
",6914253,Calculon," No, I think it's self-explanatory.
",3614254,Calculon,"  Nooo!
",814255,Calculon," Funny story: The script called for me to say ""yes"" but I gave it a little twist.
",8214256,Humorbot 5.0," Anecdote accepted. Snappy comeback not found. Please put your hands together for my next guest. Winner of five Olympic medals, Coilette from Robonia.  So, Coilette, many young Fembot's wish to emulate you. Any advice for them?
",22814257,Coilette," Yes, Humorbot. If you ask me, women today are too stuck up to go out and jiggle their Jello like everybody wants them to. In fact, should I do it now?  Alright then!  Woo! Look out, baby! Work it out! Ooh, shake that thing! You gotta use it, lady! Shake it up a little! That's right. Come on! Look at that!
",30814258,Calculon," Madam, I am one impressed celebrity.
",3814259,Coilette," Oh, I bet you say that to all the five-Olympic-gold medal-winning Fembots!
",7614260,Calculon,"  From this day forward I shall do so whenever possible.
",5714261,Coilette," Golly ... what?
",1714262,Calculon," Coilette, this may be presumptuous--
",3814263,Coilette," That's my favourite kind of this!
",3514264,Calculon," But I would be honoured if you would join me for dinner sometime.
",6714265,Coilette," Calculon, you'd be fulfilling this naive Robonian farmgirl's fantasy.
",7114266,Calculon," Of course I would.
",2014267,Coilette," This top makes me look fat. Is it trampy to go on a first date nude?
",7014268,Amy," Yes.
",614269,Coilette," Perfect.
",1014270,Fry," You gotta tell me: You're not actually attracted to Calculon, right? And if you are, don't tell me. Are you?
",11014271,Coilette," Certainly not. But just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Is that so much to ask?
",12214272,Leela," Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace and I refuse to be involved. And you have way too much lipstick on.
",11614273,Coilette," Are you kidding? I need more lipstick! Much more!  Ooh, yeah! That's the stuff! Men love it when you really glob it on.
",12114274,Leela," No, they don't.
",1714275,Amy," No way!
",914276,Coilette," Oh, please! Every man wants a tramp. No wonder you girls aren't married.  I tell you, men are so much better at being women.
",12614277,Fry," But what if he wants to-- I mean, if he tries to ... uh ... Barry White?
",7414278,Coilette," I'll just tell him I need a commitment first. That'll stick a potato in his tailpipe!
",8714279,Hermes," Good Lord, man! What kind of temporary woman are you?
",5514280,Coilette," Look, why don't all of you just back off? Can't a girl enjoy herself without being judged?
",9214281,Farnsworth," Oh, dear. Her mood swings are getting wilder. She's becoming a slave to her emotions. Just like all women. Particularly you, Leela.
",13314282,Leela," I'm worried about him too, Professor.
",3914283,Elzar," Hey, ma'am, you sure can put it away! You saved me a trip to the dump. Bam!
",7714284,Calculon," I'd appreciate it if you didn't bam the young lady.
",5314285,Elzar," Well, I'd appreciate it if I did. So I guess we're even.
",5814286,Calculon," You know, Coilette, I've never before met a woman as fascinating as I am. You're such a sweet, soft Fembot. And you have this free spirit about you.  And there it is. It's as if you understand the male mind better than I!  I've never met anyone like you.
",25614287,Coilette," Oh, yes, you have.
",2014288,Calculon," Coilette, I'd like to spend some  quality time with you.
",5814289,Coilette," What? Ah! Whoa! No way! Not gonna happen. What kind of girl do you think I am?
",8014290,Calculon," Have I mentioned that I own the world's biggest and most elegant yacht?
",7314291,Coilette," Woo! I'm a trophy girlfriend!
",3114292,Amy," No kidding. These gifts have been coming non-stop!  I think Calculon's falling for you.
",8914293,Coilette," Bah! Any day now he'll dump me for a new wad of arm candy. And then I can turn back into a guy and hock all this stuff! It's just a game.
",13914294,Calculon," Coilette, I can't stop thinking about you. I can't sleep at night, although, as a robot, I don't do that anyway. But if I did I couldn't because I love you so.  Oh, my darling ...  ... Will you marry me?
",20514295,Coilette," Oh, Calculon! Yes, I will!
",2814296,Amy,"  Maybe she's right about the lipstick.
",4014297,Fry," I'll miss you, buddy. You've been like a brother and then a sister to me. And now you're getting married. I love you, man.
",12414298,Coilette," The marriage is a scam.
",2514299,Fry," Cool. What's for dinner?
",2614300,Leela," What do you mean ""a scam""?
",2814301,Coilette," I marry Calculon, divorce him, take half his money and turn back into a guy. It's sort of a two-person pyramid scheme.
",12014302,Fry," That's marriage alright!
",2614303,Leela," That is so unbelievably manipulative.
",3914304,Coilette," Come on! You never went on a date with a guy just 'cause you were hungry?
",7514305,Leela," Well I, uh, I thought I might like him on a full stomach.
",5914306,Coilette," Nice try, sister. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to meet with my wedding planner.  Zoidberg.   Zoidypoo, please tell me frilly is in this year.
",14614307,Zoidberg," I saw a frilly cake in here you would remember all your life. I know I will. Late at night it haunts me with its frosted beauty.  Order the cake, damnit!
",15514308,Calculon," I have something for you.
",2714309,Coilette," A remote control? You got me a TV?
",3614310,Calculon," No, my dearest, it's the remote control to my heart. It symbolises the power you have to sway my emotions.
",10814311,Coilette," Will it work on my TV?
",2414312,Calculon," We don't need TVs, we have each other! Coilette, if I weren't able to spend my life with you I would leap from this very balloon.
",13114313,Coilette," Come on with that. Really?
",2814314,Calculon," Yes! We were meant to be.
",2714315,Coilette," So ... you really and truly love me?
",3814316,Calculon," So much so that I'm prepared to give up showbusiness itself to be with you.
",7714317,Coilette," But, you always said you'd rather burn down a convent than give up showbusiness.
",8214318,Calculon," I always said many things. But now all I want is a peaceful life and a quiet villa overlooking a vineyard ... with you.
",12114319,Coilette,"  Would we have donkeys?
",2514320,Calculon," All you could eat!
",2014321,Coilette,"  Oh, take me in your arms and compress me. Compress me tight!
",6314322,Calculon," Stop! Let us climb to the heavens that the gods themselves might envy us!
",7514323,Coilette,"  I just don't think I can go through with this scam.
",5414324,Amy," What?
",714325,Fry," So now you do wanna marry him?
",3214326,Coilette,"  No, I just don't wanna hurt him, or humiliate him. Oh, curse this woman's heart!
",8314327,Fry," Eck!
",614328,Farnsworth," You're falling into the final debilitating stages of womanhood. You've waited too long to switch back, you ding bat!
",11814329,Leela," OK, look. If I help you with this do you promise to get out of my gender and stay out?
",8814330,Coilette,"  Uh-huh.
",1014331,Leela," Alright. Now there's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon. But he's an actor. If there's one kind of pain he can handle, it's soap opera pain.
",16114332,Leela,"  OK, is everyone ready?
",2514333,Fry," Check.
",814334,Amy," Uh-huh.
",914335,Hermes," Yep!
",614336,Zoidberg," Basically.
",1214337,Preacherbot," Dearly beloved actors and casting people who might be looking for someone to play a preacher, I welcome you. The bride has written some vows that we will now all pretend to be interested in.
",19214338,Coilette," Dearest Calculon, forever is not enough time to tell you of the many ways I love you.
",8714339,Hedonismbot," Oh, my!
",914340,Calculon," Is there a doctor in the--
",2814341,Zoidberg," I came as soon as I could.  It appears to be a case of African hydraulic fever!
",8114342,Calculon," Dear God! The very illness my TV character caught in season two when I was holding out for more money. It's often fatal.
",12214343,Coilette," Whatever happens, remember, the flame of my eternal love will burn forever.
",7714344,Calculon," Of course. But, smoochiepups, I thought one could only catch hydraulic fever deep in the diamond mines of the Congo.
",11814345,Leela,"  Coilette, you she-devil!  You really thought you could steal those diamonds from me and Congo Jack?
",10214346,Coilette,"  Those gems belong to the natives!
",3614347,Leela," Hi-yah!
",914348,Calculon," Oh, how cruel and melodramatic fate is.  Why?
",4714349,Coilette," Calculon, my darling, your loud ""why"" brought me partway back to life.  Congo Jack!
",8514350,Calculon," Another shocking twist!
",2514351,Fry," Yes. And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumbay! He says this ...  ... is from Congo Jack.
",10014352,Coilette," Uh, um...
",1114353,Calculon," No! Nooo!  N-O-O-O!
",2114354,Coilette," I won't leave you. Not until I'm sure you understand the thing I said before. About my eternal love for you burning ...  ... et cetera.
",13714355,Calculon,"  I do. I do.
",1414356,Coilette," OK then.
",1014357,Zoidberg,"  I'm a doctor, she's dead.
",2814358,Calculon," She lives no more. But let us all find comfort knowing that she truly loved me. To honour my pain, I shall star in a film dedicated to her memory. And this time, the Academy will not deny me. Not when they see Coilette: A Calculon Story.
",23914359,Calculon,"  Coilette, your death fills me with sorrow,  anger,  fear,  every emotion an actor can display.
",9714360,Farnsworth," Turn off that crap-o-rama! One mistake now and Bender will be trapped forever between the already ill-defined robot sexes.
",12414361,Coilette," Ow! Ooh! Ow! Oh!
",1814362,Fry," Well, Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals.
",10014363,Coilette," It truly has. My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself.
",7314364,Farnsworth," Almost done.
",1414365,Coilette," If only somehow, someway, he and I could--
",4414366,Bender," Drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night long!
",8414367,Fry," Yay! My buddy's home! And his respect for women is back to normal.
",6814368,Leela," I kind of hoped this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your sensitive side.
",10214369,Bender," Yeah, you'd think, but what you gonna do?
",4314370,Calculon,"  Coilette, the skies themselves weep upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
",8114371,Leela," Aw!
",514372,Amy," Aw!
",514373,Fry," Ew!
",514374,Zoidberg," Gross.
",814375,Farnsworth," Sentimental drivel-poop.
",2614376,Fry," C'mon, Bender, let's go. This chick-flick is getting me all barfy.
",6814377,Bender," Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be hated.
",4614378,Calculon,"  Goodnight, Coilette, my turtle dove.
",3914379,Bender," Goodnight, Calculon.
",2214380,Leela," What did you say?
",1914381,Bender," I said you two don't dress trampy enough.  I still got it!
",6014382,Man #1," $10, please.
",1414383,Fry," Aw, man!
",1014384,Nannybot 1.0," Sleep, little dumpling. I have replaced your mother.
",5414385,Leela," Aw!
",514386,Bender," Oh, my God! Robot beely-boppers!
",3414387,Fry," And there's a robot scratching post.  You should try it out, Bender.
",7014388,Bender," Please, I have some dignity!
",3014389,Wernstrom," Ladies and gentlemen, my Killbot features Lotus Notes and a machine gun. It is the finest available.
",10214390,Farnsworth," Like fun it is, you glass-headed wallaby!
",4314391,Wernstrom," No one calls me that! I'm having at you!
",4214392,Farnsworth," Wernstrom!
",1214393,Farnsworths Killbot #1," Such senseless aggression.
",2814394,Wernstroms Killbot #1," Come on. Let's go for a paddle-boat ride.
",4314395,Bender," The secret was scratching really, really hard!
",4814396,Announcer #1,"  And now, the woman who Mom-opolises the robot industry--
",5914397,Fry,"  I get it!
",1214398,Announcer #1,"  Mom!
",714399,Fry,"  Oh, now I get it!
",2014400,Mom," Hello, dearies.
",1714401,Bender," Woo! I love that old bat!
",2714402,Mom," Ladies and gentlemen, for the 17th year in a row, the future of robotics has arrived. Boys?  I give you ... Robot 1-X!
",12014403,Larry," Ow!
",514404,Igner," Ow! Oh!
",914405,Bender," Neat!
",714406,Mom," Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put all my previous models to shame. Incidentally, would one of my previous models mind coming up here?
",13514407,Bender," Right here! I'm comin'! C'mon, baby! I'll do it! C'mon, Mom!
",6214408,Refreshment-bot," Jerk!
",714409,Bender," Here we go. I'm your top of the line, Mom.
",4414410,Mom," Notice that this obsolete robot runs on alcohol and emits pollution. Whereas Robot 1-X runs on pollution and emits pure oxygen with a fresh pine scent.
",15314411,Bender," Man, that smells great!
",2514412,Mom," Now, let's see how both robots do at a typical household task: Sorting a jar of pocket change.
",9614413,Robot #1 1-X," Task completed. Total value, $4.73 and one Albanian lek.
",5814414,Mom," Very good, Robot 1-X. And you, bending unit?
",4614415,Bender," Uh, I never got the change.  Suckers.
",3914416,Mom," Presenting Mom's Friendly Robots.
",3514417,Bender," That new robot is great, huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap!
",7014418,Farnsworth," Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office.
",6014419,Bender,"  Eep!
",714420,Leela," Let's try him out. Robot 1-X, can you clean Nibbler's stanky litterbox?
",7314421,Robot #1 1-X," I can and will.
",1714422,Bender," Hey, I could have done that if you'd asked me.
",4814423,Leela," I asked you five minutes ago.
",3114424,Bender," You call that a kiss? I'll show you!  C'mere, Nibbler!
",5614425,Farnsworth," Oh, look, Bender. If you want something to do stop making out and give us a hand.
",8314426,Hermes," Here. Go up on the roof and install this fake satellite dish so we can impress the neighbours.
",9614427,Bender," Yes, sir. I'm on it!
",2214428,Hermes," Oh, and have Robot 1-X help you.
",3414429,Bender," Get outta here, freshman! I don't need your help.
",5114430,Robot #1 1-X," Our owners asked me to assist you.
",3614431,Bender," Yeah? Well assist this!
",2514432,Bender," When I screamed ""help"" I didn't mean you!
",4314433,Robot #1 1-X," I apologise. However, I was able to do your job before I saved your life.
",7514434,Bender," Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.
",6914435,Amy," Spleesh! Mell out, Bender. Come watch some TV.
",4814436,Bender," I can't. I'm stuck in the can.
",3214437,Leela," Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out.
",3814438,Bender," Never!
",814439,Leela," Why can't you accept his help?
",3214440,Bender," I hate him.
",1314441,Leela," But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglar's kit.
",8914442,Bender," I can't ask for his help because--
",3614443,Farnsworth," Yes?
",614444,Bender,"  I'm scared of him.
",2114445,Leela," Oh, sorry.
",1214446,Farnsworth," Well then there's only one solution: You need an upgrade to make you compatible with Robot 1-X's new technology.
",11414447,Bender," An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?
",9214448,Fry," Oh, yeah, no, you're pretty perfect.
",3814449,Bender," Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade?
",5314450,Farnsworth," Yes! For God's sakes, yes!
",2814451,Bender,"  Fine. I'll be back in a few days.
",3614452,Roberto," Man, I hate those new 1-X robots. I'd like to stab 'em! Give 'em some of these!
",8114453,Bender," Yeah! Right on, nutcake!
",2614454,Roberto," Parole officer says I gotta upgrade or he won't give me back my stabbing knife. But it's no big. I hate those 1-X so much I know it won't affect me.  Death to the 1-X robots!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots! The 1-X robots are my friends.
",24514455,Bender," W-W-Wait! What happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?
",6314456,Roberto," I'm past that. Later, blood!
",3014457,Bender," It's like he's not him anymore.  You took away his robo-humanity.  I changed my mind!
",8714458,Bender," I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life?  I'm too scared to get the upgrade but I can't face my friends again without it.  And so I set sail for unknown shores. Oh, merciful Poseidon, take pity on this mechanical mariner.  Oh, jeez!
",24214459,Bender,"  Curse you, merciful Poseidon!
",3214460,Bender," Boy, what is the deal with the ocean? A tropical island, huh? Well, I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter.  There. Well, I guess I'll go out for a while.
",19714461,Bender," Damn. One rock short of rescue!
",3314462,Bender," Oop! Low on power.  Better fuel up!  Oh, no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze.
",10214463,Bender," Don't panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps.
",6914464,Bender," Hey, I should be mad at you! Now turn around.
",4714465,Bender," Beer!  Ow!
",1214466,Bender," Who ... is ... it?  Ow!
",2514467,Bender," Who are you and why should I care?
",3614468,Cartridge Unit,"  Side A.  We're a community of outdated robots who refused to upgrade and came here--   Side B.  To live a simpler existence, free of technology.
",14714469,Bender," A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!
",6614470,Cartridge Unit," Your mother.
",1414471,Lisa," What Cartridge Unit means is the very things that make us obsolete also make us unique. I, for example, need to keep refilling my waterwheel or I'll power down forever.   Oh, God! I'll never make it this time! This is the end!   Anyway, we like it here.
",25514472,Bender," Like you have a choice.  So what's your problem?
",5014473,Sinclair," Not enough... uh--
",2014474,Bender," Memory?
",914475,Sinclair," Oh, great. Now I remember that word but I forgot my wife's face.
",6614476,Lisa,"  Oh, God, no! I want to live!   If you'd like, you're welcome to join our society.
",8414477,Bender," Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television! Without television how will I know what's buzz-worthy?
",14714478,Sinclair," Why would you wanna watch TV when you can watch a snail crawl for hours on end?
",8114479,Bender," That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
",4314480,Bender," Oh, man! He's never gonna make it over that next pebble! Wait, wait! Oh, my God! He made it!
",9414481,Lisa," Yeah!
",714482,Sinclair," Way to go!
",1214483,Bender," That was the greatest thing ever! Let's party!  Yeah, baby! C'mon!
",6814484,Lisa," Where did you get that CD?
",2814485,Bender," It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never really thought I'd get to use them. But look at me now. Ooh, yeah, baby! Do that thang!
",13714486,Lisa," CDs are unnatural. Why don't you just listen to the ocean?
",6014487,Bender," Which ocean? That ocean?  Whoa! It's like the earth is making sweet, salty love to itself while all the fish groove on it. So much for this garbage.  Take that, Beethoven, you deaf bastard!
",19114488,Bender," Bang, bang, bang. You sure got this life thing figured out, cymbal-banging monkey.
",8414489,Lisa," Hi, Bender. We know how much you miss technology, so we brought you this washing machine that drifted ashore.
",11114490,Bender," Ooh! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w--  You--!
",5414491,Lisa," What? I don't understand.
",2714492,Sinclair," Is he alright?
",1614493,Bender," Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery!
",5614494,Cartridge Unit," But, Bender, you are technology. You're the most advanced thing on this entire island.
",8814495,Bender," Oh, it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function.  But not for long!
",8014496,Bender,"  Oh! Ow, that hurt! Oh!
",2514497,Lisa,"  The downgrade is complete!
",2914498,Bender," Behold, my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery, wooden ass!
",8514499,Lisa," Welcome to your new life of simple tranquillity.
",5014500,Bender," Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways. By force!
",8414501,Cartridge Unit," What?!
",814502,Bender," We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!
",6114503,Cartridge Unit," What?!
",814504,Bender,"  Row, comrades! Row!
",2214505,Bender," We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush!
",9114506,Lisa," We've been sailing for three weeks. Maybe I should check our position with the periscope.
",9114507,Bender," Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery, I say!
",6214508,Lisa," Did you see anything?
",2314509,Bender," Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!
",3914510,Bender," And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!
",6514511,Sinclair," Technology is defeated. Let us return to the island and celebrate by counting rocks!
",8614512,Cartridge Unit," I'm for that!
",1514513,Bender," Whoa, whoa! No one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority. Ready the catapult, Sinclair.  Aim for their power lines. They're the devil's veins and electricity is his blood.
",26914514,Lisa," Bender, If we don't survive the attack, I want you to know ... I love you.
",7614515,Bender," OK, fine. Fire!
",1714516,Farnsworth,"  Oh! I'm blind!
",1714517,Leela," Professor, we have no power.
",3014518,Farnsworth," What do you mean ""no power""? We're living in the future.
",5814519,Leela," I'd better light some candles.
",3214520,Bender," Friends, I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you from the ""complicated"" part I mean not the ""lives"" part.
",12714521,Leela," Oh, Lord, he's made of wood! What now, Bender?
",4814522,Bender," I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot, just as nature intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X.
",11314523,Farnsworth," That's just stupid.
",2114524,Robot #1 1-X," Does Mr. Bender wish me to destroy myself?
",4414525,Bender," I don't need your charity.   Target Robot 1-X and fire!
",5714526,Farnsworth," You wanged my ship, you walnut-panelled idiot!
",4814527,Bender,"  Try again, Sinclair. I said ""target Robot 1-X""!
",5014528,Sinclair,"  Who's Robot 1-X? Launching.
",3014529,Zoidberg," So, I guess everything worked out fine.
",4114530,Leela," Great! Now we're being crushed.
",3314531,Amy," Help us, wooden Bender!
",2514532,Bender," Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something.  What the--? Termites? Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic arms!
",16014533,Hermes," Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also  we're dying!
",5814534,Bender," I'm a-comin'  Ow! Lousy primitive body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an outdated piece of junk!
",10714535,Robot #1 1-X," Sir, might I recommend--
",2614536,Bender," You shut up. No, wait! I can use you as a tool to save my friends and I'll still be the hero who everyone says how great he was!
",13014537,Robot #1 1-X," How may I help you?
",2114538,Bender," Save my friends!  And Zoidberg!
",3314539,Amy," Look! My hair got singed into an even cuter do!
",4914540,Fry," Hey, where's Bender?
",2214541,Bender," Down here.  I'm so sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.
",10914542,Leela," Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1-X.
",11214543,Bender," Oh, yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like ""Save them!"" and he was all ""No problem!"" and then he did it--
",11014544,Bender," This new technology is great!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 1-X robots are my friends!
",10014545,Fatbot," It's like his personality is totally different now! Oh, maybe this upgrade isn't such a good idea.
",10014546,Bender," I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the--  Hey! What's the dealy-o?
",7614547,Technician," Your upgrade is complete.
",2714548,Bender," But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups.
",10514549,Technician,"  Everyone experiences the upgrade differently.
",4814550,Bender," Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay, probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?
",17814551,Technician," No, get out.  Next.
",2114552,Bender," Well, I guess reality is what you make of it.  Oh, thanks, baby!
",6614553,Farnsworth,"  Oh, Lordy Lou! Help!
",2314554,Fry,"  I know you've rejected me a lot before but, frankly, I wasn't sure we were right for each other either. But now I am. So how 'bout a date tonight?
",14914555,Leela,"  Sorry. I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on.
",5414556,Farnsworth,"  Buddha! Zeus! God! One of you guys do something!
",5114557,Fry,"  Come on, Leela, what's the real reason you won't go out with me?
",6714558,Farnsworth,"  Help! Satan! You owe me!
",2714559,Leela,"  Look, um, I'm embarrassed to admit this but you forced me to: I can't go out tonight because...  I have sweaty boot rash.
",12414560,Amy," No spluh! Why do you think I'm sitting over here in the stink-free zone?
",7414561,Fry," So, will you go out with me?
",3014562,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. I'm still technically alive. Yes!  But I need to you to dispose of this crazy-ass experiment that almost killed me.  You'll have to throw it into the sun itself. For only the thermo-nuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction.
",28214563,Bender," I can hit it with a shovel.
",2914564,Farnsworth," That's not good enough.
",2514565,Bender," This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel.
",7514566,Farnsworth," Yes, yes.
",1114567,Zoidberg," So what's in the box, already?
",3214568,Farnsworth," No peeking!  I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend it.
",10014569,Hermes," Ow! You hurt my collator!
",2714570,Farnsworth," I don't care.  Listen well: No matter what happens, no matter how great your curiosity, you are forbidden to look in this box. Forbidden!  Pretty tantalising though!
",16714571,Fry," Whatever's in there, it's the only thing I've ever wanted.
",6014572,Zoidberg," In my experience, boxes are usually empty. Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top. And one time pepperoni!  What a day that was!   Give me the box!
",15714573,Hermes," Scram, you lousy green snakes!  Here, Leela. Take this and use it to shoot those guys.
",8814574,Leela," Right. If they try to look in the box.
",4014575,Hermes," Whatever.
",1114576,Fry," Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away.
",6714577,Bender," Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?
",5414578,Fry," No.
",514579,Bender," That's what makes it so funny!  OK, he wasn't joking. Now shut up and follow me.
",8214580,Fry,"  Ow! It's hot! The butter in my pocket is melting.
",5214581,Bender," We thank you, Bender, for the gift we are about to receive.
",6114582,Fry," Tangled-up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them.
",6614583,Bender," And unlabeled booze! Wide-mouth too!
",3814584,Leela," That oughta keep those dopes occupied.  I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it.
",11114585,Leela," Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. What a mockery of justice that I can't take even a little tiny peek.  I need coffee.  OK, heads I look, tails I don't.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Heads! I mean, alright then. No! I have a duty not to look. Well, then again, I promised the coin I would.  Oh, it's deep. Deeper than a small box should be.
",45414586,LeelaA," Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!
",3914587,Fry1," Leela, what have you done?
",2814588,LeelaA," Nothing. What do you mean ""Why was I looking in the box?""
",5914589,Fry1," I mean your hair. It's all different-y.
",4114590,LeelaA," Bender? Is that you?
",2214591,Bender 1," You know it! Large and in charge!
",3514592,Farnsworth 1," Leela? Oh, there's a woman for you! Always dyeing her hair instead of not looking in a box.
",9314593,LeelaA," I didn't dye my hair. This is how I always look.
",5014594,Bender 1," No, that's how you always look.  This throws my entire perception of reality into question. Clone? Robot? Or long-lost twin? Taking all bets! I also offer video poker.
",16914595,Fry1," It's some guy wearing a Leela costume! Get him!
",4914596,LeelaA," Hold it! You have this all wrong. I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow.
",8914597,Fry1," You shut up, sir!
",1914598,Farnsworth 1," No, wait! I've got it. I know what's in the box. Oh, I've been as dumb as Fry.
",8014599,Fry1," Am not!
",914600,Farnsworth 1," It contains a parallel universe. And when you create a parallel universe, it's almost always populated by evil twins.
",11914601,LeelaA," Now, look: I am not evil. My loan officer said so.
",5214602,Farnsworth 1," Oh, you'd like us to believe that wouldn't you, Leela? Or should I say Evil-a?
",8014603,Bender 1," Oh, this is awful. Somewhere there's a Bender more evil than me. I do my best, damnit!
",8814604,Farnsworth 1," Leela?  Uh, the good Leela.  I want you to snoop around the other universe and find out how evil they are.  Here.
",11514605,LeelaA," I tell you they're not evil. But don't be confused. They are jerks.
",6914606,Zoidberg A,"  Hello!
",914607,Leela1,"  Hi-yah!
",1014608,Zoidberg A,"  Ow!
",614609,Leela1," Come out of your universe with your hands up!
",4714610,FryA," Oh, wow! It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip.
",8514611,Farnsworth A," Astonishing! I must have created a parallel universe.
",5514612,Farnsworth 1," Baldercrap! I created your universe. All you created was my fist parallel to your face.
",8914613,Farnsworth A," Ow.
",514614,LeelaA," Look, it doesn't matter who created what. The important thing is-- Yah!
",7314615,Leela1,"  We're exactly the same. I know all her moves. Therefore, I've got the upper hand.
",8414616,Farnsworth 1," Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.
",6514617,Farnsworth A," Let's recap what's happened so far.  As you can see, I accidentally created a box containing your universe.
",10914618,Farnsworth 1," While I, in a simultaneous blunder, created a box containing your universe.
",7714619,LeelaA," This is getting confusing. Why don't we call our universe ""Universe A"" and this universe ""Universe B""?
",10414620,Bender 1," Hey! Why can't we be Universe A?
",3414621,Fry1," Yeah!
",714622,Amy1," Yeah!
",714623,Farnsworth 1," We want A!
",1214624,Zoidberg 1," It's the best letter!
",2314625,FryA," We called it first. Besides, this place kinda feels like a ""B"", y'know?
",7314626,Leela1," Alright, you can be crummy Universe A and we'll be Universe 1.
",6414627,Fry1," Or ""The Mongooses"". That's a cool team name. The Fighting Mongooses!
",7014628,Farnsworth A," Wait a second. If everyone is identical, why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn't?
",10114629,Leela1," Well, to be honest, I tossed a coin. It came up tails so I didn't look.
",7314630,LeelaA," That's weird. Mine came up heads, so I did.
",4514631,Farnsworth A," Interesting. Apparently, the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes.
",11014632,Bender A," That explains fruity here!  I tossed a coin to pick my finish. Fog hat grey!
",7814633,Bender 1," Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass!
",3514634,Farnsworth A," You people and your slight differences disgust me. I'm going home. Where's that blue box with our universe in it?
",11514635,Farnsworth 1," Oh, you'd like to get back to your evil universe, wouldn't you? And destroy your box with our universe inside it.
",11514636,Farnsworth A," Nonsense! I would never do such a thing unless you were already having been going to do that!
",9514637,Farnsworth 1," Wha?
",614638,Farnsworth A," You heard me!
",1514639,Farnsworth 1," In any case, I've hidden the box and it will remain hidden until I'm convinced you're not evil.  Everyone, keep an eye on your evil counterpart.
",14614640,Farnsworth A," And you all do the same!
",2614641,Leela1," Um, can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together? We have plans tonight.
",7814642,LeelaA,"  You guys are dating?!
",2414643,Fry1," Oh, no, no. We're married.
",2814644,Bender A," I've got my eye on you, boy!
",3014645,Bender 1," Don't even think about it, lunch-pail! You'd be dead before you hit the ground.
",8114646,Bender A," Good point. Whattya say we just hit a strip joint?
",5214647,Bender 1," I was waitin' for one of us to say that!  Bender A, you're a prince among robots. Can you forgive me for distrusting you?
",12314648,Bender A," Aw! I can't stay mad at what is essentially me. I love me!
",6014649,Amy1," This is so great! I always wanted an imaginary friend!
",5614650,AmyA," I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel. We're exactly the same, right down to the--  Splech! Is that pink nail polish?
",11314651,Amy1," Is that not pink nail polish? The Professor's right, you are evil. And shallow.
",8114652,AmyA," I am not evil!
",1614653,LeelaA," So, Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?
",4514654,Fry1," Funny story. I asked Leela out a million times but she just kept rejecting me.
",8014655,Leela1," I'd make up stuff like ""I have sweaty boot rash"" or ""I have to meet the President""!
",8514656,Fry1," Oh, man, you never heard such excuses! But, like a dope, I believed her. Looking back on it now, it's kinda funny.
",11614657,FryA,"  It sure is. Right, Leela? Funny. Ha ha ha ha!
",4814658,Leela1," Then one night, when Fry asked me out, the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts. I knew he wouldn't buy it, so I did what I always do in those situations.
",16414659,LeelaA," Oh, Lord...
",1314660,Leela1," I flipped a coin. It came up heads and we went out.
",5314661,FryA," You mean you flipped a coin too? And it was tails? So that's why you said you had to meet that ghost.
",10314662,Leela1," You really missed out on something, Leela. That date was magical.
",6714663,Fry1," One year later, I gave Leela a diamond scrunchie and we were married.
",7114664,LeelaA," Ooh!
",614665,FryA," One year later, I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchie!
",8314666,Farnsworth 1," Well, that was pointless.
",2714667,Farnsworth A," Say, I hope you won't think it ""evil"" of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound.
",8914668,Farnsworth 1," Oh, this old thing? I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain.
",8014669,Farnsworth A," Of course! I had the same idea. I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed. But it came up tails, so I didn't. How'd it go?
",12914670,Farnsworth 1," Well getting the brain out was the easy part. The hard part was getting the brain out!
",8814671,Farnsworth A," Oh, you!
",1014672,Zoidberg 1," So, tell me about yourself.
",2914673,Zoidberg A," Well, don't look into it, but I'm a respected internal medicine doctor. Ooh! A can!
",8514674,Zoidberg 1," As for me, I design mansions, then live in them.   I'm lying! I'm an appalling failure!
",8914675,Zoidberg A,"  Me too! A big, fat one!
",2614676,Zoidberg 1," And those co-workers, always looking down on us Zoidbergs. What are they, from Nob Hill?
",9014677,Zoidberg A," They're all like ""Stop spraying me with ink, Zoidberg!"" ""Put on pants, Zoidberg!"" ""Don't touch our fancy box, Zoidberg!""
",12214678,Zoidberg 1," Oh, that box! Too good for us, is it?
",3914679,Zoidberg A," Bah! Someday they'll watch from down in the gutter, they will, as King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box.
",10714680,Zoidberg 1," You know, maybe a certain blue lobster saw where Professor hid the box.
",7314681,Farnsworth 1," Good news, everyones!
",2314682,Farnsworth A," After carefully reading the scriptures, we've concluded that none of us are evil.
",8314683,Farnsworth 1," Yes, the Bible is the real good news. Anyhow, you're all free to go back to your own universe.
",9614684,Hermes1," What's goin' on here? Why aren't you all out destroying the Professor's box?
",7814685,Leela1," Hermes, aren't you curious about the fact that there's two of everybody?
",7414686,Hermes1," No. Now like my granny used to say back in her tarpaper shack on Montego Bay, ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself.""
",14714687,Farnsworth 1," Your granny can go to hell! I've hidden the box so no one can destroy the home universe of my handsome friend here.
",11714688,Farnsworth A," Oh, go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe...
",9814689,Farnsworth 1," Then your Hermes...
",2114690,Farnsworth A," Oh, my!
",914691,Narrator,"  And sure enough...
",2114692,Hermes," Like Granny said, ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself."" God rest her zombie bones.
",11414693,LeelaA," So we go back through the box and stop Hermes?
",4814694,Farnsworth A," Right. Good thing Professor B there hid it in the coelacanth tank. No one but a crazy lobster would look there!
",11314695,Farnsworth 1,"  It's gone!
",1314696,Zoidberg A," All hail Zoidberg, the king with the box!  Now it's my turn, maybe?
",6914697,Zoidberg 1," The box says no.
",1814698,Narrator,"  Meanwhile in Universe A, Hermes A heads towards the sun ... A.
",6514699,Hermes," Item one: Box. Check! Item two: Sun.  That's a big check.
",5914700,Hermes1,"  If I know parallel Hermes, he's at the sun by now.
",5314701,Bender 1," Our universe is doomed!
",2514702,Bender 1 and Bender A," Doooooooomed!
",1514703,Farnsworth 1," Now don't give up yet, you cry babies. The box is gone but we still have one preposterously slim hope.
",10414704,AmyA," Is it a kind of hairspray?
",2814705,Farnsworth A," No! We must attempt to make another box containing our universe. Doy!
",7114706,Fry1," Well? Is that your universe in there?
",3914707,FryA,"  Nope. Too cold.
",1814708,Farnsworth A,"  Hmm! All women!  I'll put this one aside for later.
",5414709,Hermes1," Oh, man, it's hopeless! We'll never find your universe in time. Plus, this box is stuck on my fat head.
",10514710,Farnsworth 1," Yes, it's the apocalypse alright. I always thought I'd have a hand in it.
",7514711,Bender 1," I'm not sad because I finally found someone as great as me. It's like I always say, ""Make new friends and keep the old. One is silver--""
",13814712,Bender A," ""And the other's gold.""
",2514713,Zoidberg 1," Why with the long faces?
",2614714,Leela1," The idiots have the box!
",2614715,Zoidberg A," I think she means you.
",2414716,Farnsworth 1," Grab them!
",1214717,Zoidberg 1,"  You coward! Wait for me!
",2714718,Amy," Blug! Which one did they go into?
",3514719,Farnsworth A,"  Oh, let's all ask each other! That'll solve this problem!
",6014720,Farnsworth 1," We'll each have to search a universe. Everyone, grab a length of wire first so you can find your way back.
",10814721,Amy1," Hello? Did you see two smelly lobsters?
",4114722,Hermes25," We didn't see anything ...  ... ever!
",3914723,Fry," Yo! Uh, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?
",4414724,Fry9," Hell, no!
",1114725,Leela9," Shut up!
",1014726,Bender 9," Beat it, jerk!
",1614727,LeelaA," Uh, have you robot versions of you guys seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?
",7914728,Fry31,"  Negative. Will you go out with me?
",3714729,LeelaA," Uh, access denied.
",2014730,Bender 1," Hey, pal, look what I snagged from the Leprechaun Universe!
",6114731,Bender," Yeah, Leprechaun Universe is fine ... if you haven't seen Pirate Universe!
",7614732,Bender 1," Faith and begorra!
",2014733,Farnsworth XVII," Quae?
",714734,Zoidberg A," Quick! Into another box!
",2614735,Zoidberg 1," There aren't any in this universe, there aren't. Hey, you, what with the no boxes?
",8414736,Farnsworth," Baby, they're somewhere. Everything's like somewhere! Place is kinda au naturel right now.
",9214737,Farnsworth 1," There they are!
",1714738,Farnsworth A," Gotcha!
",914739,Farnsworth," Dig it! All of you fitting in this boxed is like seriously freaked up!
",7214740,Farnsworth 1," Nonsense! Why, there's a whole universe in there.
",5114741,Farnsworth," Dude, there's a universe in all of us.
",4014742,Amy," Right on, Professor Freaksworth!
",3414743,Farnsworth A," Get a job!   We've got the box. Everyone, pull your wires.
",6014744,Farnsworth A," Hurry! Back to Universe A!
",2814745,Farnsworth A," Hermes, don't press that button!
",3414746,Hermes," OK.
",514747,FryA," Bye.
",614748,LeelaA," Good luck, Leela.
",1914749,Zoidberg A," So long, Your Majesty!
",2414750,Amy1," Later!
",814751,Fry," There but for the flip of a coin go we. So, um, Leela? Seeing how the universe wasn't destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight? You know, together?
",14814752,Leela," Well, I guess you deserve one more flip.
",4214753,Fry," So, heads or tails?
",2114754,Leela," Y'know, let's just say it's heads.
",3614755,Farnsworth," Ready?
",814756,Farnsworth," and  One, two, three, pull!
",2914757,Farnsworth," There. That space-time eversion has given us their box and vice versa.
",7214758,Leela," So, what you think you just explained to us is that--
",5514759,Farnsworth," Correct! This box contains our own universe.
",4614760,Hermes," Sweet honey bee of infinity!
",3014761,Leela," Bender! Quit destroying the universe!
",3914762,Bender," But--
",714763,Farnsworth," Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box. And the box itself is probably worth something too. We must cherish it, as we cherish every moment of our lives.
",16514764,Announcer #1,"  This week in the universe.  Dateline, Turantulon 6: The brave warriors of Earth, under the command of General Major Webelo Zapp Brannigan, have achieved victory over the spider homeworld.  And to the victor belong the spoils; one trillion dollars in silken treasure.
",26914765,Zapp,"  Mmm!
",714766,Nixon,"  My fellow Earthicans, after meeting with top voodoo economists, I have decided to refund our silk surplus to you, the taxpayers. That's right! I've sent you each 300 buckaroos in the form of a Tricky Dick Fun Bill. Knock yourselves out!
",23914767,Zoidberg," Money!
",814768,Amy," I'm slightly richer!
",2214769,Bender," What to do, what to do? One $300 hookerbot or 300 $1 hookerbots?
",6614770,Leela," I'm going to swim with a whale. They're the gentle giants of the deep.
",7214771,Farnsworth," I'm well aware of that.
",2514772,Scruffy," Scruffy's gonna get himself one of them $300 haircuts. This one's lost its pizzazz!
",8514773,Zoidberg," A fortune, it is! At last Zoidberg will live like a rich man!
",6314774,Nixon,"  Hey, cut it out! Go away! Get away!
",3814775,Amy," Shmeesh! It's just 300 bucks. What is that, like a hundred cups of coffee?
",7614776,Fry," That's it! I'm getting a hundred cups of coffee. Starting now.  Coffee machine, one cup of coffee, please.
",10814777,Nixon,"  Smells good!
",1514778,Zapp,"  Leela? Are you there?
",2414779,Leela," No.
",514780,Zapp,"  Oh, yes, you are! I'm hereby inviting you and your oddball co-workers to a special reception to display the national silk surplus. I believe you know the heroic space stallion who captured it. Show them my medal, Kif.
",22014781,Kif,"  He rented it with his tax refund.
",3614782,Zapp,"  So, Leela, will you have the pleasure?
",4114783,Leela," What little there is to be had.
",3314784,Zapp,"  Tomorrow night at eight them. Smooches!
",4214785,Crack Addict," No cheap crack houses for me no more!
",3914786,Man #1," Very good, sir. Shall I pre-warm sir's crack pipe?
",5214787,Amy," Oh, Kif, it was so romantic of you to rent this paddle plane with your tax rebate. We're like two dandelion seeds wafting on the breeze.
",13814788,Kif,"  Yes. Seeds ... wafting.
",2614789,Amy," I almost feel kinda shallow for blowing my rebate on this cool talking tattoo!
",8014790,Tattoo #1," Hey, Gordon Gecko! I cost as much as this whole crummy date!
",6214791,Amy," Shut up!  Ow!
",1514792,Farnsworth," Uh, ma'am, it has become too much of a chore for me to clean out my wrinkles each day. Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process?
",14414793,Geneworks Woman #1," Well, yes. In the same way an infant may fight Muhammad Ali. But--
",6814794,Farnsworth," One pound of stem cells, please.
",3414795,Geneworks Woman #1," Of course, any age-reversing effects will be purely temporary.
",6414796,Bender," Say, buddy, why's this Grand Cigar so pricey?
",4714797,Clerk," Well, as you can see, its wrapper is a piece of the original US Constitution. It was hand-rolled by Queen Elizabeth during her wild years and was buried with George Burns until graverobbing space mushrooms-- Uh, well you know the rest.
",23714798,Bender," Give you 300 bucks for it.
",2814799,Clerk," No can do.
",1214800,Bender," Oh, alright, I'll just take these $300 burglars tools then.
",6114801,Clerk," Very good, sir.
",1714802,Bender," So, uh, what time d'you close tonight?
",4014803,Dwight," Hey, Pops! Did that tax rebate come?
",3814804,Hermes," Came and went! You're now the proud owner of Bamboo Boogie Boots.  With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun.
",12714805,Dwight," But, Pops, I don't wanna have fun. I wanna be like you; boring but prudently invested.
",8814806,Hermes," Babylon's bells! I tallied almost 300 bananas on this entertainment product. Now you put 'em on and have fun.
",11114807,Dwight,"  I don't wanna!
",1714808,Hermes," Well then I'm gonna put 'em on and make you watch me have fun.  See? Fun! Fun--  Dwight! Help me!
",9914809,Dwight," I'll save you, Pops!
",2214810,Farnsworth," Hey! Turn that damn music--  Up!
",3414811,Hermes," Isn't this fun?
",1714812,Dwight," No! I wish I had two mommies!
",3114813,Randy," Try these, uh, sir.
",2114814,Zoidberg," I ask for rich guy stuff and you give me shiny pebbles? Bah! I bid you adieu.
",7914815,Randy," Ow!
",514816,Leela," I'd like a pass to swim with Mushu, please.
",4514817,Whale Biologist," Well you asked the right guy. I'm the whale biologist. Though personally I hate whales.  Especially Mushu.
",10814818,Leela," Then why'd you become a whale biologist?
",4214819,Whale Biologist," I don't know you well enough to get into that. $300, please.  Noon tomorrow. If you're late you only get to tread water in the scallop tank.
",14214820,Fry," Uh, I'll have a coffee.
",2514821,Man #1 #2," Guppy, trout, mermaid or--
",2814822,Fry," Whale, please.
",1614823,Kif,"  Amy, I-I also spent some of my tax rebate on a gift for you.
",6314824,Amy," Oh, Kiffie!
",1314825,Kif," It shows the time wherever we both are. And it's powered by love! Also, you have to wind it.
",9414826,Tattoo #1," Oh! Somebody won big at Skeeball!
",3514827,Amy," You shut up! I love it, Kif. I'll use it whenever I wanna know what time it is.  Ooh! It's Fry and Leela!  Hi, Fry and Leela!
",12714828,Kif," Oh! Keep peddling! Oh, for the love of God, keep peddling!
",6014829,Amy,"  Bye, Fry and Leela!
",2214830,Tattoo #1," Oh, I can't wait until the tattoos on Amy's butt hear about this!
",6714831,Tattoo #2," Hear about what?
",1814832,Tattoo #3," Tell us!
",1014833,Amy," Don't feel sad, my little tadpole.
",3614834,Kif,"  I'm trying not to. But my gift to you is in the belly of a whale.
",6814835,Zoidberg," Say, this reminds me of that time I ate that other watch Kif gave you.
",7214836,Amy," Hey, it is kinda like that.
",2914837,Zoidberg," To induce vomiting, that was the solution. Everywhere it went!  What a Valentine's Day that was!
",9814838,Leela," Hmm. This may seem like a huge coincidence, but I happen to have an in with that whale.
",8914839,Scruffy," Scruffy's formulated a plan, but you'll need a ready source of nauseatin' rotten fish.
",8814840,Elzar," Freshen your coffee, sir?
",2714841,Fry," Yeah, yeah, yeah! Keep it coming! Put the pot down! Get away!
",6314842,April," You're so young in spirit. It's hard to believe you're as old as 25.
",7014843,Farnsworth," The key is to grab life by the hojos! Live every day like it might be your last.
",8214844,Elzar," What'll it be, kids?
",2214845,Farnsworth," One bowl of mild farina.
",2614846,Leela," Pay dirt!  Hi-yah!
",2014847,Elzar," Here you go, big spender. Foie gras and caviar.
",4914848,Zoidberg," Goose liver? Fish eggs?  Pah! Where's the goose? Where's the fish?
",6814849,Elzar," Hey, that's what rich people eat. The garbage parts of the food.
",6614850,Zoidberg," I ate garbage yesterday and it didn't cost me $300! I'm not paying.  Farewell, good sir!
",9014851,Bender," Le Grand Cigar! She is mine! And with absolutely no consequences.
",6714852,Smitty," You see that?
",1514853,URL," Grand theft tobacco. Time to get off our fat, cop asses and ride!
",6714854,Elzar," Pee-yew! This fish is slightly too rotten to even make jambalaya.
",6714855,Amy,"  So far, so good. Where's Kif?
",3214856,Fry,"  This isn't Yemeni! It's Sulawesi!  And the cup's shaking! I don't want my coffee shaking!
",9214857,Bender," You seem a tad wound up, buddy. And your face is greasy. Real greasy! You been up all night?
",9414858,Fry," Of course I've been up all night! Not because of caffeine. It was insomnia. I couldn't stop thinking about coffee. I need a nap.  Coffee time!
",14414859,Bender," Ah! Mighty fine smokable!
",2714860,Fry," Fancy cigar. Why don't you smoke it already? Puff, puff! Go, go, go, go, go!
",7814861,Bender," Nah, you can't blow the smoke from such a majestic stogie in just anyone's face. I'm saving it for the fancy-pantses at Zapp Brannigan's black tie reception. You comin'?
",17114862,Whale Biologist," And the fifth reason whales kill is for the sheer fun of it.
",6214863,Leela," Anything else?
",1614864,Whale Biologist," Yeah. You're lumpy and you smell awful.  Hey, I calls 'em like I sees 'em! I'm a whale biologist.
",9914865,Leela," OK, Mushu, it's feeding time!  Oh, crud! He ate my suit.
",5814866,Whale Biologist," The suit was ugly. Whale biologist!
",3714867,Caddy," Perhaps if you tightened your grip, sir?
",4214868,Zoidberg," Ah! Thank you, golf slave.  Bah! Rich people wouldn't waste their time on this nonsense. Plus, these eggs are gritty and tasteless.
",13314869,Farnsworth," Ow! Not so rough!
",1914870,Whale Biologist," Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Mushu, the educated whale who thinks he's better than you.
",9314871,Amy," C'mon, Mushu! Barf! Barf like a freshman!
",4314872,Whale Biologist," And now, ignorant whale lovers, we'll see who's boss as I make Mushu jump through this hoop. Jump, Mushu!  Who wants a fish?
",12614873,Sam," Mushu is sad!
",1514874,URL," It just keeps comin' and comin'.
",3414875,Kif," Wait! That chunk. It's the watch!  I got it, Amy! I got it! The plan went off without a--
",9114876,Whale Biologist," He's got aquarium property! Stop him!
",3914877,URL," Better do what he says. He's a whale biologist.
",4914878,Smitty," You're under arrest, you squishy punk!
",4014879,Zapp," The Spiderians, though weak and woman-like on the battlefield, are masters of the textile arts. Taste like king crab, by the way. Crazy bugs actually wove this tapestry of my heroic conquest while I was still killing them.
",22414880,Zoidberg," What? It's not even scratch and sniff? But if rich people think it's good, I'll buy it.  One art, please!
",10714881,Mom," What a clever impersonation of a stupid, poor person. How much is that placemat actually worth, Brannigan?
",10814882,Zapp," Exactly $1 billion.
",2114883,Mom," Now that's walking-around money!
",3414884,Nixon,"  What? Hey! Wait! Aroo!
",2514885,Whitey," So I said to Kitty, ""The only way to keep the butler from running away is to cut off his foot.""  Yes, it reminds me of a joke I heard about upper-middle-class people.
",16814886,Amy,"  I've never been sad at a party before. I wonder if my mind is thinking about Kif being in jail.
",9814887,Scruffy," Jail's not so bad. You can make sangria in the terlet. Course, it's shank or be shanked.
",9014888,Amy,"  Of course.
",1314889,Whale Biologist," Look, just give back our property and we'll drop the charges.
",6314890,Kif," Fine, have the watch. It's broken anyway.
",4314891,Whale Biologist," I don't want your watch. You're covered in precious ambergris.
",6414892,Kif," Precious ... hamburgers?
",2614893,Holo-Roseanne," Ambergris. Noun. A grease-like product of the sperm whales digestive tract that is used as a base in the finest perfumes. This has been Roseanne, your guide to the world of facts.
",18114894,Whale Biologist," You heard Roseanne. Scrape off the priceless ambergris and I'll let you go.
",7714895,Kif," Or-Or better yet, I'll simply shed my skin.
",4514896,Morbo," Stop it! Stop it! It's fine! I will destroy you!
",5014897,Farnsworth," Wha?  Uh, gotta go. Uh, fight club!
",3714898,April," What's happening, Hubie?
",2614899,Farnsworth," I'm afraid the face you fell in love with was actually just a blob of living gunk I bought with my tax refund.
",11214900,April," Well as long as we're being honest, I also spent my tax refund on a crazy treatment.
",8614901,Farnsworth," That certainly is honest.
",2714902,April," It's better for us to both just be ourselves. You, wrinkled as a prune.
",7314903,Farnsworth," You, fat as the queen of sea cows.
",3614904,April," I love you!
",1314905,Farnsworth," Oh, my!
",914906,Kif," So, you see, the putrid, waxy substance I was coated with was--
",6514907,Amy," Not precious ambergris!
",2514908,Kif," Yes! And I managed to sneak some out in the usual place. Ta-da!  Using that, I'll make you a perfume of lilac and jasmine and frankenberry.
",14114909,Amy," Oh, Kif, it's so romantic I can't even wait! I'm gonna wear it right now.
",7514910,Mom," Who smells like freaking porpoise hork?
",4114911,Amy," I do! Kiss me, Kif!
",2114912,Zoidberg,"  Oh, what a foolish squid I've been. I'm not rich. I can't even buy one measly masterpiece.
",9314913,Gus," Pardon us, gent. Might a couple of hungry, hungry hobos take a feed from that aluminum snack box?
",9914914,Zoidberg," So now I'm in the gutter, surrounded by bums who eat garbage? Money brought me no happiness. Bupkiss!
",10314915,Dandy Jim," Ooh! This boot's got a little pudding at the bottom.
",5414916,Bee #1ler," Interestingly, the Spiderians are more closely related to our elephants than our spiders.
",9114917,Hermes,"  Don't mind us!
",1714918,Nixon," The loot! The loot! The loot is on fire!
",4214919,Zapp," Leela, my precious rock tub. I'll save you!
",4514920,Kif," Everyone! To the fire door!
",2914921,Leela," It's on fire!
",1514922,Farnsworth," We're trapped, my sweet hippopotamus!
",3914923,Fry," Coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee!
",8114924,Dwight," Where are we, Pops?
",2114925,Farnsworth," Wha?
",614926,April," What happened to the food?
",2814927,Leela," I think we were saved by a mysterious orange blur.
",5214928,Zoidberg," Welcome, one and all. I finally figured out how money could make me happy. By using it to buy my hungry friends a feast.
",12214929,Dandy Jim," Everyone join us. Oysters Rockefeller here has provided genuine turkey dogs!
",7814930,Whitey," Heck, you're never too rich to enjoy a free turkey dog.
",5714931,Amy," Yeah!
",714932,Bender," Alright! Turkey dog!
",2214933,April," I'll take four!
",1714934,Leela," Me too!
",914935,Mom," Oh, what the hell.
",2014936,Hermes," Here, Dwight. The boots only cost $299.99. You invest this penny like you wanted.
",8314937,Dwight," Thanks, Dad. I'm gonna take this and buy five shares of Amazon.com.
",6914938,Hermes," A risk-taker? That's my boy!
",3014939,Nixon," The entire surplus is gone! Oh, what a McGovern I've been! Why did I have to issue that crooked tax rebate?
",10914940,Leela," At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it.
",6114941,Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes.
",1414942,Bender," Speaking of which, my story kinda petered out without me learning a lesson.
",7714943,Smitty," There he is!
",1414944,Bender," Alright! Closure!
",1914945,Holo-Roseanne,"  Futurama. Noun. Um, I don't know, you just watched it, dummy. What are you asking me for? Hey, here's a fun definition: Idiot. Noun. You!  This has been Roseanne, your guide to the world of facts.
",19914946,John DiMaggio," Prepare for the stereophonic experience.
",4214947,Bender," Aw, New New York City! Woooo! Woooo! Don' worry about it! Do the robot, baby!
",7914948,Farnsworth," Oh, Lord! Hiking is always such a strain on the buttocks.
",5914949,Fry," Shh! What was that sound?
",2714950,Bender," It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this.  Aww, they're so cute when they're scared.
",10014951,Fry," I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. He's been sighted a lot in this area recently. Just last week, a blind hiker felt him.
",12514952,Farnsworth," Don't tell me you actually believe in Bigfoot, you blathering ninny-hammer.
",7714953,Fry," Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing up, he was the celebrity I most identified with.
",9314954,Zoidberg," Why?
",614955,Fry," 'Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters yet longed to be one.
",7614956,Zoidberg,"  I can so relate to that.
",2714957,Leela," Ugh! Enough emotions! This isn't a fat camp, for God's sake.  Although you wouldn't know it from looking.
",10714958,Zoidberg," Bender, if you want to sleep in the tent tonight, you're welcome to join me and Hermes for a little ""just friends"" spooning.
",12614959,Bender," Nah, I'm comfy out here under the stars.  Real comfy!
",5514960,Ranger Park," Hey, I'm Ranger Park, the park ranger.
",4014961,Fry," I get it!
",1114962,Ranger Park," Now since this area's a national Bigfoot preserve, we'll start with a short film about Bigfoot while I make a few phone calls.
",12814963,Narrator,"  Bigfoot ...  ... Endangered Mystery!  In the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest ...  ... dwells the strange and beautiful creature known as Bigfoot, perhaps.
",16414964,Fry," That proves it!
",1714965,Narrator,"  Sadly, logging and human settlement today threaten what might possibly be his habitat. Although if it's not, they don't. Bigfoot populations require vast amounts of land to remain elusive in.  They typically dwell just behind rocks but are also sometimes playful, bounding into thick fogs and out-of-focus areas.
",31514966,Ranger Park," It should say ""Top Quality Exercycle For Sale"" and could you put ""top quality"" in bold? You can't? OK, whatever.
",11414967,Narrator,"  Remember, it's up to us. Bigfoot is a crucial part of the ecosystem, if he exists. So let's all help keep Bigfoot possibly alive for future generations to enjoy unless he doesn't exist. The end.
",19714968,Ranger Park," I-I gotta call you back.  Alright, questions?
",4714969,Sal," Yeah. Have yous ever seens Bigfeet?
",3714970,Ranger Park," Technically, no. But I do see him each night in my dreams and each day in the smiling faces of hairy children.
",11214971,Farnsworth,"  Bunk! Bunk I say! Bring me a bag full of Bigfoot's droppings or shut up!
",7514972,Ranger Park,"  I have the droppings of someone who saw Bigfoot.
",5114973,Farnsworth," Shut up!
",1014974,Bender," Oh, my God! Look! It's Bigfoot!
",3314975,Ranger Park," Where?
",814976,Bender," Eh, he's gone. He said you should keep wasting your life though.
",6614977,Petunia," Oh! I saw Bigfoot crushing cars at the county fair.
",5314978,Ranger Park," What you saw was Bigfoot the monster truck. But thanks for a great question.
",7814979,Fry," Sir, if I may, why don't you just set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and see if he walks by one?
",11214980,Ranger Park," Ah, that would be very expensive, and most people who believe in Bigfoot are broke.
",8514981,Bender," Hey, look! Bigfoot! He's back!
",3214982,Ranger Park," Where?
",814983,Bender," Up your face!  Everybody do the Bender!
",4114984,Amy," The sky out here is amazing. Look at all those satellites.
",6014985,Farnsworth," Goodnight, employees.
",2314986,Hermes," Goodnight.
",1214987,Zoidberg," Goodnight, Hubert.
",2014988,Fry," You doin' alright out there, buddy?
",3714989,Bender," Better than these gnats!  That guy won't be goin' home to his kids.
",6914990,Bender," Who's that? A wolf? Or some kind of boogen? Oh, God, I wish I was safe inside a tent.   Fry! Fry wake up! It's me, Bigface!
",12514991,Bender,"  Come out and groom my mangy fur!
",3514992,Fry,"  Huh? Bigfoot? You taught yourself English?
",4514993,Fry," Bigfoot? Bigfoot?
",1914994,Fry," Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the others, Bigfoot; I see through your monster coatings to the gentle loner inside. I bet you have a wounded racoon friend that you tenderly nurse back to health while you go...  But in the end they shoot you. But you teach us about things.  Oh. Just a flying saucer.  Excuse me? You can't park here. The parking area's over there.  Wow! Nice tube.  Hey! Hey, what's the big idea? Stop abducting me. Why does your vanity plate say ""Probe 1""?
",47914995,Leela," There's nothing so refreshing as the clean, crisp taste of this bold Canadian beer.
",8514996,Hermes," Well, see you in an hour. I gotta go do some business behind that tree.
",7314997,Amy," Bender, wasn't that Fry's tent?
",3314998,Bender,"  ""Bender""!
",1214999,Leela," Bender raises a good point: Where is Fry?
",4315000,Fry," Amy, you won't believe what happened ...  ... it was so scary that you wouldn't--  I know, but listen, it gets even scarier.
",12615001,Farnsworth," Fry! What in Sega Genesis happened to you?
",4415002,Fry," That's what I'm trying to tell you. See--  Why are you all staring at me like that? Is there something on my face?
",11615003,Hermes," Uh ... no.
",1215004,Leela," Someone should tell him.
",2615005,Fry," Tell me what?
",1515006,Leela," Nothing.
",1015007,Zoidberg," Well I have a lot of experience telling patients bad news, so let me break it to him gently.   Fry, you have no nose! Your nose is gone! You have no nose on your face! Where it is I can't say but on your face it's not!
",22015008,Fry," What?
",715009,Bender," Aww! I think it's sweet. You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your hero. Me, Bender!
",10315010,Fry,"  My God! They must have taken it last night.
",4615011,Farnsworth," Which last night?
",1915012,Fry," In the woods. I was walking ... for Bigfoot, looking ... and then aliens beamed me up.
",8815013,Amy," Were they little grey dudes with big oval heads?  I don't get that gesture. Am I wrong?
",8915014,Zoidberg," Cheer up, friend. When we get home a high-quality prosthesis will have you looking good as new.
",9715015,Fry," I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined.
",4215016,Hermes," Man, you are such a jokester!
",3115017,Fry," I'll never have another moment of happiness.
",4615018,Leela," I know you're trying to mask your pain with humour, but don't worry. I'm sure the Professor can clone you a new nose.
",11915019,Fry,"  Eh, it wouldn't be the same. I want my nose. I don't want to have to teach a new one how to shoot milk when I laugh.
",11915020,Farnsworth," Well there's no sense fretting. Good Lord, you're ugly! The fact is your nose is gone and we'll never find out who did it or why.
",13115021,Bender,"  Guys! Guys! There's something on television.
",4715022,Linda,"  Alien abductions: Until now, a harmless nuisance. But recently they've taken on a sinister dimension as unsuspecting victims are returned ... without noses.
",15915023,Fry," Like me!
",1015024,Morbo,"  The culprits: Shameless poachers, hunting humans without a permit.
",6915025,Linda,"  The valuable nose, or ""human horn"", fetches a high price on alien worlds as an aphrodisiac.
",9415026,Fry," My nose is an aphrodisiac?  I'm gonna drop a barf!
",5215027,Morbo,"  Demand for human horn is great, due, in part, to titillating scenes from depraved alien TV programmes too filthy for Earth broadcast. Let's watch.
",14915028,Neptunian Woman #1,"  Human horn? But ... it is forbidden!
",3915029,Neptunian Man #1,"  So is our love.
",1815030,Fry," Blech! We have to track down my nose before some alien snarfs it and does the worm. Who's in?
",9515031,Leela," Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg if he feels like it.
",5515032,Zoidberg," No, I'm good.
",1515033,Alien," Let's see, I'll take a pancreas, two sphincters and a large Coke.
",6715034,Vendor," One number three combo!
",2515035,Fry," It's no use. We've been to every scuzzy bazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery Barn.
",8715036,Leela," Wait. What's that?
",2015037,Salesman #1," Welcome, friends. How may I pervert you?
",4215038,Fry," Uh, I'm looking for human horn.
",3315039,Salesman #1,"  Shh! You're not cops, right?
",3115040,Leela," Of course not. In fact, he's a crook.
",3915041,Bender," Yep. Stolen Pez anyone?
",2515042,Salesman #1," Right this way.
",1715043,Salesman #1," Human horn. So fresh you can still see the eyeglass marks.
",6015044,Fry," Nope. Uh-uh. Ew!  Now look. This is the nose we want. Did you sell it to somebody?
",8415045,Salesman #1," I'm sorry, sir, but due to the perverted nature of our business, customer records are strictly confidential.  Right this way.
",12715046,Salesman #1," I video-tape everyone who comes in here so I can blackmail them later.  Hey, I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Here's the weirdo who bought your horn.
",17815047,Leela," That's Lrrr! Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
",5215048,Lrrr,"  You got any, uh, you know, uh  human horn?
",4515049,Salesman #1,"  Speak up! You're muttering!
",3015050,Lrrr,"  I said, uh  human horn?
",2615051,Salesman #1,"  You're not a cop, right?
",2715052,Lrrr,"  Oh, no, no. I'm just some guy ... ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8!
",7415053,Lrrr," So let me get this straight: If I buy eight Caramello bars, you all get to go to some camp.
",9315054,Bender," Yep. That's exactly the lie we used to get past your guards.
",6215055,Fry," Oh, great space king, I humbly beg you to return my human horn.
",6515056,Lrrr," Uh, human horn? How ridiculous! Why would a virile male like Lrrr need human horn? I don't even know what it's for. What is it, something you-you put in salad dressing?
",17015057,Ndnd," Like you've ever seen a salad.
",3215058,Lrrr," My weight is appropriate and attractive!
",4215059,Leela," Whoa! You guys have issues.
",2915060,Lrrr," She has issues! I'm fine! But there's no human horn around here, so make friends with the door.
",9715061,Fry,"  Alright. I give up. I guess I'll just go home and marry a skunk.
",6715062,Ndnd," Oh, let's just give it to him.  Here.
",3915063,Fry," My nose! Light of my face!
",2815064,Lrrr," Uh, what is that? How do you have that, Nd-Nd?  I've never seen it before. My friend left it here.
",10015065,Leela," Hold still, Fry. I can reattach it with my emergency face laser.
",6615066,Fry," Hey! You burned my cheek!
",2715067,Leela," Yeah, sorry, I wasn't really concentrating.
",4515068,Fry," No, I mean the singed flesh, I can smell it!  And those lilacs on the table.
",7815069,Lrrr," At least someone noticed.
",2715070,Ndnd," For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your first wife was the one who liked lilacs.
",8715071,Lrrr," She also liked to shut up!
",2815072,Fry," Well, great seeing you. I guess we'll be on our--
",5115073,Bender," Yo, Highness. Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's nose for an aphrodisiac instead of his, you know, wing-dang-doodle?
",14115074,Lrrr," But, uh, I thought the horn was the human wing-dang-doodle.
",6115075,Bender," No, sir, chief! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet. Ever seen soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their noses, I'll tell you that much. Well, see you!
",20515076,Lrrr," Interesting. The trousers conceal a tiny secondary horn.
",5815077,Fry," Hey, what've you heard?
",2515078,Lrrr,"  Guards! Seize him!  Prepare to harvest the lower horn!
",5715079,Fry," OK, you can have my nose.
",2715080,Lrrr," Guards!
",915081,Guard #1 #1," Yeah?
",715082,Lrrr," Remove the human's lower horn and prepare it to be eaten by me.
",6515083,Ndnd," In other words, slop a lot of ketchup and salt on it.
",5515084,Lrrr," Then bring it to our royal bedchamber and put it in the sock drawer with all the other things that have failed to arouse my passion for this woman.
",14915085,Guard #1 #2," Remove pants!
",1515086,Fry," Wait! Listen. I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn--
",6915087,Bender,"  I'll say!
",1215088,Fry," But in this case I-I just don't think it'll do any good.
",5815089,Bender,"  That's what she said!
",2415090,Leela," Let's face it, you two have deep relationship problems that can't be solved by an aphrodisiac.
",9615091,Fry," However huge it might be.
",2715092,Ndnd," So what do you suggest, painfully-single human?
",4915093,Leela," Well, why don't you think back to what brought you together in the first place?
",8115094,Ndnd," Oh, I don't know. Lrrr used to be so tender.
",4615095,Lrrr," I only wrote that poem to test my printer.
",4415096,Ndnd," We'd go walking in the woods and Lrrr would find injured little tinkle-bunnies and nurse them back to health.
",11115097,Lrrr," Yes, but I'm the one who injured them!
",4015098,Ndnd," Oh, shush. You stepped on them by accident and then you cried all night. That's the kind of sensitive man you used to be.
",12315099,Lrrr," And you used to wear a size-3 cape.  But not anymore! Now bring me that lower horn while I'm still in the mood.
",11315100,Fry," Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of mutilating me?
",8515101,Leela," Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there for a romantic dinner under the stars.
",11015102,Ndnd," Hmm. Sounds interesting. But he would never do it.
",5215103,Lrrr," Like hell I wouldn't. I'm not gonna be blamed for not going.
",6215104,Fry," Then it's a deal. We get one night. I keep my horn as long as you two end up doing the horizontal monster mash.
",11315105,Bender," I don't get it!
",1715106,Bender," Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine for the edge of the table?
",6715107,Lrrr," No, thanks. Just water, please. Tap water!
",4415108,Ndnd,"  Oh, big spender!
",1915109,Lrrr,"  That's it! This date is over. Waiter!
",4015110,Fry," So, what can I get you this evening?
",3815111,Lrrr," Your lower horn!
",1815112,Fry," I'll just start you off with some bread. Some sexy, arousing bread!
",6915113,Lrrr," Fine! But none of that whole-grain goat food. And bring plenty of melted butter.
",8215114,Ndnd," Why don't you just inject some fat straight into your ass and cut out the middle man?
",8715115,Lrrr," One of these days, Nd-Nd. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the third moon of Omicron Persei 8!
",8715116,Lrrr,"  Mmm! This jerked chicken is good. I think I'll have Fry's lower horn jerked.
",7915117,Bender,"  It's used to it!
",1915118,Fry," So, uh, how are you two snooky-poopums doing?
",4715119,Ndnd," Poorly.
",915120,Lrrr," My wife is right, for once. There's very little magic in the air. Ready the lower horn transport vessel.
",10615121,Bender," Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin?  Hey, uh, mind if I stick these in here?
",10215122,Guard #1 #1," Go for it.
",1215123,Leela," Don't worry, Fry. Things look bad but I still have a trump card; the most beautiful love song ever written.
 And I will always love you,
Will always love you.
",16015124,Ndnd," The humans are attacking!
",2715125,Lrrr," Pluck the lower horn and let's get out of here!
",4915126,Bender," Quick, Fry! Run for it!
",2515127,Fry," Come on, freedom cage! Roll me to safety!  Yes! I never thought I'd escape with my doodle, but I pulled it out!
",11315128,Bender,"  Just like at the movie theatre!
",3415129,Lrrr," Give me that!
",1515130,Fry," Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it! The Loch Ness Monster's book was right!
",7215131,Lrrr," Well, hello there, my furry friend.
",3715132,Ndnd," Look at his adorable little feet.  Yes, you are a cutie-pie.
",6215133,Ranger Park," Holy macaroni!  I can't believe I'm seeing Bigfoot! He's in focus! Oh, I've waited my entire life for this moment.
",11615134,Ndnd," What?
",715135,Bender," What are you doing with that?
",3115136,Lrrr," You're going to kill this innocent giganto?
",4515137,Ranger Park," Of course not. I'm just gonna tranquilize him so I can chop off his feet as proof he exists. Then dump him back in the wild. He'll do fine.
",14115138,Lrrr," You'll have to get through me first.
",3815139,Ranger Park," OK. Nighty night!
",1915140,Lrrr," Now leave this gentle Sasquatch, or Wood Ape, in peace so I can finally and at long last harvest this pathetic human's lower horn.
",13215141,Fry," Yeah!
",715142,Lrrr," Wait. What am I saying? If I poach this beast's lower horn, am I any better than that ranger with his demented foot lust? Yes. But not by enough.
",14715143,Ranger Park," Score!
",815144,Lrrr," This human's lower horn is one of God's creatures, a living thing, and all living things, large and small--
",10915145,Bender,"  In this case ""small""!
",2415146,Lrrr," Have dignity and a spark of the divine.
",4115147,Ndnd," That's the gentle, sensitive, poet warlord I fell in love with.
",6515148,Lrrr,"  Uh, you'll wanna retreat to a safe, 500-metre radius!
",5615149,Leela," Well, Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn.
",6415150,Bender," As usual!   Run away!
",2315151,Narrator,"  You're on a scenic route through a state recreation known as the human mind. You ask a passer-by for directions, only to find he has no face or something. Suddenly, up ahead, a door in the road. You swerve, narrowly avoiding The Scary Door.
",24315152,Scientist,"  I have combined the DNA of the world's most evil animals to make the most evil creature of them all.
",10315153,Man #1,"  It turns out it's Man.
",2515154,Bender," Huh?  I choose to not understand these signs.
",4715155,Bender," Aha!
",615156,Fry," Bender? I was just not playing the holophonor.
",4815157,Bender," Yeah, well you should try not stinking at it.
",4715158,Fry," I am trying. I've been taking lessons.
",4015159,Bender," Lessons? Oh, that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way?
",10115160,Fry," I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me.  Hey, Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday. I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?
",27015161,Bender," Fine, I'll go already. Y'know, sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive. Not often, though.
",10415162,Bender," Whoa! Hey!
",1215163,Fry," Uh, hello, Mrs. Mellonger.
",2815164,Mrs. Mellonger," Hello, Philip.  And you must be Mr. Bender. Philip's told me so much about you. Is it true that you're a robot?
",11315165,Bender," I prefer the term ""love machine"".
",3515166,Bender," Wow! Your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?
",6615167,Mother," Fairly hard.
",1415168,Fry," The Grumpy Snail.  Sorry!
",2715169,Boy,"  It's too grumpy!
",1915170,Fry," Ow! No! Quit it! Stop!
",2415171,Mrs. Mellonger," Mr. Bender, I simply cannot teach your child.
",4715172,Bender," Then good day, madam!  We hope to see you soon for tea.
",5715173,Fry," It's hopeless! I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't keep up.
",9415174,Bender," Aww. You know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes.
",8115175,Leela," Hey, guys. You missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?
",8615176,Fry," At, uh, uh, a concert.
",2415177,Leela," Ooh! Was it jazz noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
",13915178,Bender," So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein, huh?
",5115179,Leela," Yeah, it's weird; Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched--
",8115180,Fry,"  Pretty boy.
",1415181,Leela," But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibres on his butt.  I couldn't believe it. I was really...
",17815182,Fry," That could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
",10915183,Bender," Oh, but you can. Though you may have to metaphorically make a ""deal with the devil"". And by ""devil"" I mean ""Robot Devil"". And by ""metaphorically"" I mean ""get your coat"".
",17115184,Robot #1 Devil," You hit a sour note about 200 years back, Doug!  Let's take it from the top.  Ah, Bender, Fry. You've come back for more eternal damnation.
",14115185,Bender," No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons.
",7015186,Fry," Yep. I need to get really good without practising.
",5215187,Robot #1 Devil," Hell is full of ten-year-olds who wanted exactly the same thing. Trouble is, you have what my old music teacher, Mrs. Mellonger, calls ""stupid fingers"".  With hands like that you'll be lucky to master a belt buckle.  Now wouldn't it be nice if you had a pair of robot hands to replace them?
",29215188,Fry," Sure would.  Oh, well. Goodbye.
",3315189,Bender," Fry, you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you.
",9615190,Fry," He-He-He is?  Great! Wait, what's the catch?
",4615191,Robot #1 Devil," No catch. I'll merely pick a robot at random from somewhere in the universe, probably one you've never even met, and then I'll remove his hands and switch them for yours.  It's just the sort of guy I am. What do you say?
",22215192,Fry," I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to--
",5115193,Bender," Fry, if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you.
",9215194,Fry," Well, alright. You sure I probably won't know him?
",5215195,Robot #1 Devil," Definitely probably not.  Just sign this contract.
",5215196,Bender," Wow!
",615197,Robot #1 Devil," And here we go!
",1715198,Bender," I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!
",4215199,Fry," Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!
",3715200,Robot #1 Devil," Oh, what an appallingly ironic outcome.
",4115201,Bender," It's not ironic, it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers, Cookie!
",8415202,Robot #1 Devil," Y'know, I only put my name on there as a show of good faith for the other robots.
",8315203,Fry," Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.
",4715204,Robot #1 Devil," Oh, very well.
",1615205,Fry,"  How'd you do that?
",2115206,Robot #1 Devil," They're very good hands.
",2615207,Fry," At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.
",5815208,Robot #1 Devil," Oh, sorry. That'll wear off in a couple of days.
",5015209,Fry," Check it out, everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands.
",8215210,Amy," Neat! Let's see a trick.
",2615211,Fry," Alrighty!
",1115212,Scruffy," Somebody called the Robot Devil's here to see somebody called Fry.
",6815213,Fry," Uh-oh.
",815214,Bender," Where'd I go just now?
",2415215,Robot #1 Devil," Hello, Fry.  Just dropped by to make sure you're as happy with our little deal as I am.  Give me back my hands! These things are always touching me in places.
",16015216,Fry," Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal.
",5415217,Robot #1 Devil," Looks like I wasted a bus trip.
",3315218,Fry," Yes, you did.
",1515219,Grumpy Snail,"  Yes. Now you can hear holophonor virtuoso Philip Fry play 900 of these classic themes in your own home on this two-record set.  That's over 30 minutes of music for only $14.99.
",17915220,Zoidberg," Only $14.99 for a two-record set. Two records! Oh, Zoidberg, at last you're becoming a crafty consumer!
",10515221,Man #1,"  Hello?
",915222,Zoidberg," Hello? I'll take eight!
",2515223,Scruffy," Mr. Hedonismbot to see you.
",2915224,Fry," Uh, show him in.
",1815225,Scruffy,"  Very good, sir.
",1815226,Hedonismbot," Ah, Fry. Congratulations. Your latest performance was as delectable as dipping my bottom over and over into a bath of the silkiest oils and creams.
",14915227,Fry," Thank you, sir. That's exactly what I was going for.
",5415228,Hedonismbot," You were the sole diversion in what has been a pale and unamusing season. And so I would fain commission you write an opera.
",12615229,Fry," But I've never written an opera.
",3415230,Hedonismbot," And I've never heard one. Still, if you can keep me amused through the overture I shall consider it a smashing success.
",12115231,Fry," But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless...  OK, I'll do it. If I can make it about Leela.
",10415232,Leela," Me? Really?
",1315233,Hedonismbot," A man writing an opera about a woman?  Oh, sirrah, how deliciously absurd!  I shall see you at the premiere.
",11015234,Leela," Is it part of the opera?
",2615235,Fry," Leela!  You shouldn't be listening. I don't want you to hear it till it's done.
",8115236,Leela," But it's so beautiful.
",2415237,Fry," So's a peacock but you don't eat it until it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.
",14315238,Leela," Oh, Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been a fool. A fully-justified, prudent fool.  They're so cold.
",14315239,Robot #1 Devil,"  And yet hell is so hot!  Can I have my hands back now?
",5715240,Fry,"  No!
",615241,Robot #1 Devil,"  You're not nice!
",1915242,Robot #1 Devil," Ah, Bender, this is a surprise! For you! Finding me in the refrigerator.
",7415243,Bender," True, but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?
",6315244,Robot #1 Devil," Oh, well it so happens I'm in the mood to make a deal with you.
",6515245,Bender," Forget it! You can't tempt me.
",3215246,Robot #1 Devil,"  Really? There's nothing you want?
",3615247,Bender," Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want.  Well, I suppose I've always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying.
",13415248,Robot #1 Devil," Nothing simpler! And all I ask in return is your hands.  To replace these bony hotdogs!
",8915249,Bender," Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!
",4715250,Robot #1 Devil," Well is there anything else you would part with?
",5015251,Bender," No. Nothing. Ain't gonna happen.
",3415252,Bender," Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost me was my crotch-plate.
",10815253,Robot #1 Devil," You certainly are a shrewd businessman, Bender.  Now find someone and give 'em a good blast!
",9415254,Bender," Yeah! That'll teach the first person I see a lesson.
",5415255,Robot #1 Devil," Ah, my ridiculously circuitous plan is one-quarter complete!
",6215256,Leela," Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow night. I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves that'll fit over my enormous forearms.
",12515257,Bender," Pretty annoying, huh, Leela?
",3015258,Leela,"  What? Are you talking? Oh, God! I'm deaf!
",4415259,Bender," Oops. I'm so, so sorry, Leela. I just wanted to annoy you.
",6015260,Leela,"  What? Oh, this is horrible. I won't be able to hear Fry's opera.
",6715261,Robot #1 Devil," Ah, how delightfully ironic.
",3015262,Bender," It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!
",4515263,Robot #1 Devil," Ooh! Out of aerosol? Also ironic!
",3515264,Bender," Oh, yeah? Well bite my shiny metal--   Oh, nooo!
",5015265,Leela," Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd break his heart.
",9215266,Bender," OK, deaf-o!
",1315267,Hedonismbot," Courtesans and gentle fops, I bid you welcome to my opera. Let us cavort like the Greeks of old.  You know the ones I mean.
",12515268,Leela," Yay, Fry!
",1115269,Zoidberg," I watch TV with that guy!
",2715270,Holo-Vogel,"  Who is this one-eyed female baby Moses,
With courage in her female baby smile?
",8115271,Holo-Orphans,"  A saviour from the stars,
Or something stranger still.
",5715272,Holo-Leela,"  Or just a lonely, filthy, starving child.
",4415273,Leela," Amy, Fry's looking at me. What am I s'posed to be feeling?  Ah!
",6515274,Holo-Bender,"  Leela! Leela, Leela save him!
Save Fry, save Fry,
Godzilla will devour him,
As for me,
I must be off,
To have my doctor check this cough,
Goodbye!
",14915275,Bender," I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla, but that is so what I would have done.
",7915276,Amy," One diet double Martini, please.
",3415277,Bartender," And for you, sir?
",1915278,Hermes," I'll just have a Shirley Hemple.
",3415279,Tinny Tim," Extra! Extra! World's greatest opera only half over.
",5415280,Leela," Half over? Oh, I'd give anything to hear the rest.
",5215281,Robot #1 Devil," Anything?  Thank you, sir.  Now, as I was saying, anything? Because I can give you new robotic ears!
",10215282,Leela," What? You can give me new ears? Wait. What seemingly reasonable thing do you want in return?
",9415283,Robot #1 Devil," Just your hands, my dear.
",2715284,Leela," Whatever you said, forget it!
",3115285,Robot #1 Devil," Alright then, just one hand.
",3015286,Leela," Just ... my left hand? Um, uh--
",3315287,Announcer #1," Please take your seats for act two.
",3715288,Hedonismbot," But I'm not done vomiting.
",2815289,Leela," I can't stand it!  OK. You can have my hand.
",4615290,Robot #1 Devil," Wonderful!  Just sign here.  Calculon, old friend, I'm afraid I need your ears.
",8115291,Calculon," Well I do owe you for giving me this unholy  acting talent.
",6115292,Leela," I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?
",8015293,Robot #1 Devil," In good time. You go enjoy the opera.
",3915294,Holo-Fry,"  To win Leela's heart with the holophonors art,
I need hands of transcendental quickness.
",9115295,Holo-Robot #1 Devil,"  Well I don't see any danger,
In gambling with a stranger,
For my head is of a most amazing thickness.
",10415296,Holo-Robot #1 Devil,"  I'm stupid, I'm stupid,
I'm stupider than you,
I'm stupider than you in every way.
",8515297,Robot #1 Devil," Stupider? Pah! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant!  Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry.
",17215298,Fry," Look, what do you want?
",2515299,Robot #1 Devil,"  I want my hands back.
",2415300,Fry," Never!
 A deal's a deal,
Even with a dirty dealer.
",5215301,Robot #1 Devil,"  Very well,
Then I'll take what I want from Leela.
",5215302,Leela," Whoa!
",715303,Robot #1 Devil,"  Leela has promised me her hand.
",3415304,Leela,"  Fry, you do not understand.
",3015305,Leela,"  I should have revealed I've been deafened by Bender,
The shame,
The shame,
But I feared you'd stop writing this musical splendour,
Deception's the curse of my whimsical gender,
He gave me mechanical ears,
Effective though just a bit garish,
In return without shedding a tear,
I agreed that I'd give him my hand--
",31515306,Robot #1 Devil,"  In marriage!
",1515307,Leela," What?
",715308,Robot #1 Devil,"  You'd give me your hand in marriage.
",3915309,Hermes,"  Is this really happening or just being staged?
",4915310,Farnsworth,"  It can't be real--
",2115311,Amy,"  Not if Leela is engaged.
",2715312,Leela,"  That isn't what I meant,
That isn't what I signed.
",5315313,Robot #1 Devil,"  You should have checked the wording in the fine...  Print.
",6115314,Leela,"  I'll give you my hand...
",2715315,Leela," and   In marriage.
",2015316,Bender,"  The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention,
Now that is ""irony"".
",9715317,Robot #1 Devil,"  I will marry her now and confine her to hell,
How droll,
How droll!
Where Styx is a river,
And not just a band,
Though they'll play our reception if all goes as planned,
Unless, Fry, you surrender my hands!
",20915318,Fry,"  Destiny has cheated me,
By forcing me to decide upon,
The woman that I idolise,
Or the hands of an automaton,
Without these hands I can't complete,
The opera that was captivating her,
But if I keep them,
And she marries him,
Then he probably won't want me dating her.
",27015319,Nixon," Arooo!
",815320,Zapp," Bray-vo! Enn-core!
",2015321,Farnsworth,"  I can't believe the devil is so unforgiving.
",4715322,Zoidberg,"  I can't believe everybody's just ad-libbing!
",4715323,Preacherbot,"  By the power vested in me,
By the state of New New York--
",6015324,Fry," No!  Stop! Take my hands!
 You evil, metal dork!
",5015325,Hedonismbot," Surgery in an opera? How wonderfully decadent and just as I was beginning to lose interest.  Jombey! The chocolate icing!  Oh! Oh, my!
",13615326,Fry," My hands. My horrible human hands.  And what did you do to my nails?
",7015327,Robot #1 Devil," I cleaned them. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's my poker night and I feel lucky.  So it's back to hell for me. Come on, Nixon!
",12715328,Nixon," Huh?
",615329,Hedonismbot," Less reality, more fantasy. Resume the opera.
",4715330,Fry," But I can't play anymore.
",2715331,Zoidberg,"  Yes you can! The beauty was in your heart, not your hands.  The music's bad and you should feel bad.
",10315332,Fry," Whoa! Hey!
",1215333,Tinny Tim,"  Extra! Extra! Greatest opera of all time sucks.
",5015334,Zoidberg," I'll take eight!
",1815335,Leela," Please don't stop playing, Fry. I wanna hear how it ends.
",5915336,Hermes," Planet Express delivery company roll call! Captain Turanga Leela! 
",6815337,Leela," Here! 
",815338,Hermes," Delivery boy, first class, Philip J. Fry! 
",4415339,Fry," Here! 
",815340,Hermes," Assistant Manager of Sales, Bender Bending Rodriguez! 
",5615341,Bender," Here!  Cerveza, por favor. 
",2915342,Hermes," Long-term intern, Amy Wong. 
",3015343,Amy," Here! 
",815344,Hermes," Company physician, Dr. John A. Zoidberg. 
",4315345,Zoidberg," Huh? I thought it was mine! 
",3015346,Hermes," Bureaucrat Grade 34, Hermes Conrad 
",3715347,Hermes," Is who I am. And now I am proud to present the owner and founder of Planet Express, Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth! 
",11815348,Farnsworth," You're all fired. 
",2015349,Hermes," Sweet bongo of the Congo! 
",2815350,Farnsworth," In fact, you were fired two years ago! That's when we were shut down by the delivery network. 
",9615351,Farnsworth," Yes, I'm afraid the brainless drones who run the network canceled our license. 
",8115352,Fry," We were canceled? 
",2015353,Farnsworth," Oh, it's terrible. Just terrible. Well, clear out your desks and move along. Chop-chop. 
",9015354,Farnsworth," Yes? I see. 
",1415355,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Those asinine morons who cancelled us were themselves fired for incompetence. 
",10115356,Staff," Woohoo! 
",1015357,Farnsworth," And not just fired, but beaten up, too. And pretty badly. 
",6015358,Staff," Woo! 
",715359,Farnsworth," In fact, most of them died from their injuries. 
",5015360,Staff," Woo? 
",715361,Farnsworth," And then they were ground up into a fine pink powder. 
",5615362,Fry," Why? 
",715363,Farnsworth," Oh, it's got a million and one uses. 
",3915364,Farnsworth," Ahhh, that soothes the fire. 
",3115365,Leela," So what does this mean for us and our many fans? 
",5115366,Farnsworth," It means we're back on the air! 
",3415367,Farnsworth," Yes, flying on the air in our mighty spaceship! 
",5015368,Staff," Woooohoooo! 
",1415369,Bender," We're back, baby! 
",2015370,All," Party! Go, go, go! 
",2115371,Cubert," Lower, lawn mower! 
",2115372,Hermes," What's the matter, robot? You got a rod up your spine? 
",5715373,Bender," Yes, I do. That's how I'm built. 
",3515374,All," Hooray. 
",1015375,Fry," Way to bend it! 
",1815376,Bender," You're the greatest, Bender! 
",3115377,Hermes," In Jamaica, we got 10-story office buildings lower than that. 
",6415378,Leela," Let's see you beat it, Rastaman. 
",3515379,Staff," Ooooohh... 
",1315380,Hermes," Let's make it interesting. Fetch down one of them sabres. 
",6015381,Bender," Oh, flexible. That would go good up my spine. 
",4815382,Hermes," Lower. 
",915383,Bender," The fat guy wins! 
",2015384,Fry," Go, Hermes! 
",1415385,Hermes," That's why they call me 11-inch Conrad. 
",4215386,Scruffy," Oh, no. 
",1015387,Fry," Can you save Hermes, Dr. Goodensexy? 
",3915388,Dr. Cahill," I told you, my name is Dr. Cahill. 
",3715389,Hermes," Figures I'd get mangled while the blonde bimbo's on duty. 
",6015390,Dr. Cahill," I'm a doctor, sir. The mere fact that I'm blonde and have a breathy voice, full sensual lips, and a steaming hot body doesn't make me a bimbo. 
",14515391,Zoidberg," Tell me about it. 
",2015392,Hermes," I think we've all learned a thing or two about sexual stereotypes. While my head's slowly dying 'cause I'm not in a jar yet, you bimbo! 
",13815393,Dr. Cahill," Oh, right. Ditzy-witzy! Lars, got another jar job! 
",5315394,Lars," Oh, sorry, Doctor. I was disinfecting Courtney Love... Oh, hello. 
",6815395,Leela," What are you looking at? Is it the eye? 
",4215396,Lars," Guilty as charged. It's a nice looking eye, and there's plenty of it. 
",7215397,Leela," Oh. Do I know you? 
",2115398,Lars," Apparently not. Hi. I'm Lars. 
",3215399,Leela," Oh. I'm Leela. Nice to meet you. 
",3515400,Lars," Nice to be met. 
",1815401,Hermes," Pick up ladies on your own time, you shiny-headed goat! 
",5815402,Lars," Sir, you're just a little enraged 'cause you're dying. Up and away! 
",7015403,Amy," Lars is so flirting with you. 
",3215404,Leela," He is so not. He's just being polite. 
",4015405,Fry," Who does he think he is, being polite to you? You want me to beat him up? 
",7615406,Leela," No. Stop being so immature. 
",3015407,Fry," I'll show her who's immature. 
",3215408,Fry," ""Charles de Gaulle""? Never heard of you. 
",4315409,De Gaulle," I freed France from the Nazis and... 
",3915410,Fry," Hey, Leela. I'm some French guy. 
",3515411,Bender," Rock that Frenchman, baby! 
",2915412,Labarbara," Oh, my poor little love pirate of the Caribbean! 
",5115413,Hermes," There, there, wife. Everything will be all-- 
",4715414,Labarbara," Okay, look, Hermes, we got to think of the boy. He needs a daddy. 
",6815415,Hermes," He has a daddy! 
",1815416,Labarbara," No, he got two half-daddies. Will his body be all right? 
",5915417,Dr. Cahill," Yes, but it may take a few days. 
",3515418,Labarbara," No, not soon enough. Come, Dwight, let's find you a handsome new father. 
",7515419,Hermes," LaBarbara, no! 
",1715420,Bender," It's okay, Hermes. We're all here for you. 
",4515421,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! We've got a delivery to the nude beach planet. 
",7015422,Staff," Woohoo! 
",1015423,Bender," So long, jerk.
",1615424,Announcer #1,"  Futurama is brought to you by ...  ... Torgo's Executive Powder.  Only Torgo's packs the power of five highly paid television executives into every can for maxim odour absorption.
",18215425,Torgos Jingle Singer,"  When your toilet smells like faeces,
from some disgusting species;
make it take a powder,
with Torgo's!
",10615426,Leela," It feels great to be back at the wheel after two long years. 
",6315427,Fry," That's not the wheel. 
",2415428,Leela," It's nice out. 
",1715429,Fry," ""You must be at least this naked""? How much nakeder could you be? 
",6815430,Zoidberg," Watch and learn. 
",1915431,Bender," You know, it's funny. 
",2415432,Fry," What? 
",815433,Bender," Your weiner! 
",1515434,Farnsworth," Well, I'm going in the water to prune up a bit before I strut. Who's with me? 
",8015435,Amy," I'm in! 
",1015436,Leela," I'm in. 
",1015437,Bender," Yeah, I'll go. 
",1715438,Fry," You guys go ahead. I gotta find the bartender and deliver this box of barstool softener.
",9015439,Fry," Here's your package, sir. 
",2815440,Bartender," Why are you talking to my penis? 
",3515441,Fry," Oh, sorry. Sign here. 
",2415442,Bartender," Mind if I use your pen? 
",2615443,Fry," Well, that's not a... 
",2415444,Fry," And initial here. 
",2015445,Fry," Thank you for using Planet Express. 
",3815446,Leela," Hey, Fry, I didn't know you had a tattoo of Bender on your ass. 
",6615447,Fry," Me neither. 
",1415448,Bender," You got a tattoo of me? Neat. It's like looking in a smelly mirror. 
",7015449,Farnsworth," So he's got a little ink. Big whoop. 
",3915450,Bender," Sweet photons. I don't know if you're waves or particles, but you go down smooth. 
",8415451,Nudar," Sir, would you care to sign our petition? 
",4415452,Bender," I support and oppose many things, but not strongly enough to pick up a pen. 
",7815453,Nudar," That's just what the guys who oppose the things you support want you to do. 
",7815454,Bender," Really? Down with those guys! 
",3215455,Fleb," And we'll need your e-mail address. 
",3815456,Bender," Hmm, they say you shouldn't give out your e-mail address. 
",6015457,Nudar," Right. That's just what those same guys say. 
",4715458,Bender," Them again? 
",1415459,Leela," I don't quite understand what this petition's about. 
",5515460,Schlump,": Animals? 
",1215461,Schlump,": And your e-mail address. 
",2815462,Leela," You won't send me any spam, will you? 
",4015463,Nudar," Oh, no, no, no, no. Asterisk. 
",3215464,Leelas Wrist Thingy," You've got spam. 
",1915465,Leela," Spam, spam, junk.
",1915466,Amy," Spam. Spam. ""Hi. How are you?"" Oh, that must be from Kiffy. 
",6215467,Amys computer," Hi, how are you? Low, low prices on erectile dysfunction remedies, sleeping pills, old-person drugs, and antidepressants. 
",12415468,Amy," Antidepressants? Well, I certainly don't want to get depressed. 
",6615469,Amys computer," Please enter credit card number. 
",3515470,Amy," Is cash okay? 
",1615471,Bender," Porn. Porn. Free porn. Get rich watching porn? I find that rather hard to believe. 
",8515472,Bender," Warning, perform virus scan? I'm waiting for porn over here. 
",6315473,Bender," Oh, yeah, come on, baby. 
",2715474,Zoidberg," Friends, friends! His Majesty Prince Adisaraki O. Zoidberg of Nigeria died. 
",7815475,Amy," When will those antidepressants get here? 
",4415476,Zoidberg," Wait, there's more. Once I wire some good-faith money to an overseas bank account, I'll inherit his kingdom, his canoe, and his plump young wife. 
",14815477,Hermes," You dumb stumps. Don't you realize you're being scammed? 
",5915478,Zoidberg," That is low, Hermes. Just because you don't have a body, you don't want anyone else to be prince of Nigeria. Well, try and stop me from wiring that money. 
",15715479,Farnsworth," What's going on here? According to my illegal key logging software, you've all been giving out personal information over the Internet. If Hermes were here, he'd fire you all.
Hermes: I am here!
",19515480,Farnsworth," Quiet, you. In his absence, I'm calling a mandatory company security seminar. To the mandatorium! 
",10015481,Farnsworth," Now, it's not hard to spot a phoney Internet come-on. ""Get rich quick x7 q""? Phoney. ""Lose weight with space parasites""? Phoney. What's this? I've won the Spanish National Lottery? 
",18315482,Leela," No, it's a scam! 
",1915483,Farnsworth," My goodness, I'm rich! And to think I didn't even know I had a ticket. I just need to wire some collateral to collect the winnings. 
",13415484,Hermes," Professor, stop! You're giving away personal information! 
",6015485,Farnsworth," I can afford to give away anything I want. I've won the Spanish National Lottery. 
",8415486,Amy," No, don't! 
",1315487,Leela," It's a scam! 
",1515488,Hermes," Why won't anybody listen to me?!? 
",3615489,Farnsworth," And my mother's maiden name and her bank account numbers and ... There! I'm rich. Rich. Rich! 
",9615490,Farnsworth," That must be my $400 now. Hello. Or should I say, '""Buenos dias""? 
",6815491,Nudar," Hi. We own your company now. 
",3115492,Farnsworth," Hwhaa? 
",915493,Bender," Welcome, boss. 
",1715494,Nudar," Guess I was wrong. There was a robot stupid enough to download the obedience virus. 
",8615495,Bender," I sure was. Make a hole, chumps.  Presenting our new masters! 
",6415496,Bender," Where shall I put these auto-dialers, kind master? 
",5315497,Nudar," Between the password crank and the spamjaculator. Come on! We've got a whole planet to scam. And bring me some more Gummi Fungus! 
",13215498,Leela," We don't have to stand here and take abuse from a gross nerd. 
",6415499,Amy," Yeah! 
",815500,Fry," Yeah! 
",815501,Leela," Hi-yah! 
",1015502,Nudar," Now get back to work, you turkeys. Planet Express is still in business. We've got crap loads of quote-unquote merchandise to deliver. 
",13615503,Fleb," Ship them out, Your Highness. 
",3215504,Zoidberg," Finally, some respect. 
",2515505,Amy," I feel a little better. 
",2615506,Bender," Those marvellous scammers sure scammed us, huh? 
",5015507,Leela," How can you just sit there kissing the aliens' butt flaps? Don't you realize you are totally under their control? 
",11615508,Bender," Of course I realize it. Does that mean I can't enjoy it? Boy, were we suckers. 
",8115509,Lars," Greetings, earthlings. 
",2515510,Fry," Oh, hooray. It's handsome Lars and his fabulous jars. 
",5615511,Lars," Hello, everyone who isn't Leela. And a special hello to everyone else. 
",7315512,Hermes," Shut your lockers and get to class. How's my body doing? 
",5915513,Lars," Oh, I'm afraid it's behind schedule. The museum got tricked into giving all its funding to something called the Scamming Sciences Institute. 
",14315514,Bender," It's a fake place. 
",2115515,Hermes," No! That body's the cornerstone of my marriage. What's LaBarbara going to do? 
",8015516,Amy," Spluh! She's going to go back to her first husband. 
",5415517,Zoidberg," Barbados Slim? I love that guy. 
",3415518,Hermes," Everybody loves Slim. 
",2415519,Hermes," He's the only man to ever win Olympic gold medals in both limbo and sex. 
",7515520,Lars," Well, maybe I should get going. 
",3415521,Fry," Yes, I'll show you out. 
",2615522,Amy," No, Leela will show him out. 
",3115523,Leela," No, Leela will show you out. Me. Leela. 
",4215524,Lars," So your friend, Fry, seems nice. Are you and he dati--? 
",5815525,Leela," Nope. 
",815526,Lars," Good, because I was maybe thinking of asking you out for dinner. 
",6715527,Leela," Ohhhh. I'll start maybe thinking about saying ""Sure, when?"" 
",6215528,Lars," Let me maybe give it some thought. 
",3715529,Lars," Tomorrow at 8:00? 
",2015530,Leela," Okay. 
",815531,Fry," It's not fair. I've loved Leela since the day I came to the future. Did I show you the macaroni valentine I made for her? 
",12415532,Amy," Yes. 
",715533,Fry," Look at it again. I know she thinks I'm immature, but someday I won't be. And deep down in my heart, I know we'll end up together. It's all there in the macaroni. 
",16515534,Leela," Lars asked me out! 
",2115535,Bender," What are you doing, wonderful masters? 
",4115536,Fleb," Sprunjing for information. 
",2915537,Nudar," Oh! There's something here. I can sprunje it. Robot, tear it open! 
",6915538,Bender," Goody, goody, goody, goody! 
",3015539,Zoidberg," What's that thing on your neck? 
",3415540,Nudar," Checking out my sprunjer, huh? 
",3315541,Zoidberg," I guess. What does it do? 
",2815542,Nudar," It's a special sense organ our species possesses. It engorges in the presence of...  Information. 
",10015543,Zoidberg," Lucky you. All I have is a gland that gives off foul odors when I'm bored. 
",7715544,Bender," Hey, look, a safe! 
",2115545,Farnsworth," That's my safe. I call keep-offsies. 
",3915546,Nudar," No callsies! Open it! 
",2415547,Fleb," It's a gold mine. Tax forms, Social Security cards. Combination hair, blood and stool samples! 
",9715548,Fry," I don't get it. How can you say Lars is more mature than me? 
",6315549,Leela," Well, for one thing, his chequebook doesn't have the Hulk on it. 
",6715550,Nudar," Who are you? 
",1515551,Fry," Philip J. Fry. 
",1715552,Fleb," Social Security Number 03280810? Stool type, P-negative? 
",5915553,Fry," That's right. 
",1615554,Nudar," I've never detected so much information before. I think it may be a Level 87 code. 
",8515555,Schlump," Level 87? Can it be? I thought it was only a legend, but the sprunjer never lies. 
",8415556,Nudar," It's in his pants! 
",2115557,Fry," What the hell are you talking about? 
",3915558,Nudar," Faster, faster! 
",1815559,Farnsworth," I'm sciencing as fast as I can. 
",3415560,Bender," What do you say, folks? Hot or not? 
",3815561,Nudar," You, boogerbot, read the code or I'll shoot this guy. 
",5615562,Bender," Who the hell is he? 
",2215563,Scruffy," I'm Scruffy, the janitor. 
",2815564,Bender," Hang on, Scruffy! Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, one, one, one, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, zero, one, one. 
",21815565,God," Huh? 
",715566,Fleb," A time sphere. 
",1715567,Nudar," Naked brothers, we have sprunjed upon the universal machine language time code. The key to time travel! 
",10615568,Leela," What's the secret of time travel doing on Fry's ass? 
",5515569,Fry," It was bound to be somewhere. 
",3215570,Schlump," Beyond this shimmering portal lie all the glories of history. 
",6415571,Nudar," And we can steal them! We just go to the past and take stuff with our superior weapons!
",8915572,Nibbler," Stop, you fools! 
",1915573,Amy," What's going on? 
",1915574,Farnsworth," What is happening? 
",2115575,Leela," Nibbler, you... You can talk? 
",3215576,Nibbler," I can do more than talk. I can pontificate. You must not use the code of codes. With each and every use, you risk tearing the universe asunder. 
",14615577,Schlump," The poodle-monkey may be right. The legend warns that the code is powerful and dangerous. 
",9215578,Nudar," My God. We'd better use it only three or four times. Six, max. 
",6515579,Nibbler," But even a single use could shatter the universe! 
",5215580,Nudar," Got it. Two or three times. 
",3015581,Nibbler," I see I have no choice. Nibblonians, attack! 
",4715582,???," Hey! That tickles. 
",2115583,Nudar," And the pitch! 
",1715584,Nibblonian," Mayday, mayday! 
",1815585,Aliens," Hey! Hey! Hey! 
",1715586,Nibblonian," Scamper! 
",1115587,Zoidberg," Aawww... 
",1115588,Nibbler," Alas, our kitten-class attack ships were no match for their mighty chairs. The universe is doomed. Doomed! 
",10915589,Fry," Can I pull up my pants now? 
",3015590,Nibbler," Dooooooomed!
",1415591,Nudar," Stand back you wing wangs. I'm gonna try out this timesphere with a quick test drive to yesterday. 
",10115592,Farnsworth," Bushwah. You can't go mucking about in the past without creating paradoxes. 
",7815593,Nibbler," I'm afraid he can. It's a paradox correcting time code. It all works perfectly. Except when it rips open the universe. Don't do it, I beg you ... 
",14815594,Nudar," Yesterday please, and make it snappy. 
",4015595,Crew," wha??? 
",915596,Nudar," Hello. 
",915597,Nudar-2," Howdy. 
",915598,Bender," Hey! What the ...? 
",2115599,Zoidberg," There was one, but now there's two. 
",3815600,Nudar," Nothing gets past you eagle eye. I went back to last night and met the me of that time for a drink. One thing led to another and we ended up at my place, or should I say our place. 
",18315601,Leela," Blech. 
",915602,Nudar," Oh come on ya bunch of prudes. 
",3315603,Farnsworth," This isn't merely revolting, it's impossible to boot. I know a paradox when I see one. 
",8915604,Farnsworth," Whaaa? 
",915605,Farnsworth," Ahh, paradox resolved. Someone get a mop. 
",4415606,Dwight," You're looking well pops. 
",2815607,Hermes," How can you look me in the eye 'n eye and say that? I'm nothin' but a brain. A useless, filthy brain. 
",10415608,Barbados Slim," You forgot lice infested. 
",2815609,Hermes," I didn't forget it, I just chose not to ....  Barbados Slim! What are you doin' here? IS there somethin' goin' on between you two? 
",13315610,Labarbara," Oh no no no no, we jus' ah happened to run into each other shortly after your accident. 
",9015611,Slim," And every night since then. 
",3015612,Labarbara," You're so crazy. 
",1915613,Hermes," Woman! No! Ohh, who am I kiddin'? Without my body, I'm a nobody. 
",6715614,Labarbara," I'm sorry Hermes. But look at Barbados. You can't argue with those luscious pecks. 
",8515615,Hermes," No I can't. But I can ask him to stop wiggling them in my face. 
",6615616,Slim," I'm not wiggling them. They do that by themselves. 
",5315617,Nudar," I think I'll go back in time and steal the Liberty Bell before it cracked. Or is the crack the valuable part? 
",11215618,Farnsworth," I don't know you naked crook. 
",3215619,Fleb,"  We have a problem Nudar. It's a one way time code. It can take us to the past, but it can't bring us back to the present. 
",12515620,Bender," Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Masters, if I might, let me do the stealing. I'll go to the past and snatch everything I can get my greasy mitts on. Then, as a robot, I could just wait it out for a few centuries in the limestone cavern beneath this building. Oh, it'll be ever so much fun. 
",27915621,Nudar," Hey, that's perfect. We sit back and let dum dum here do the stealing. 
",7315622,Bender," Dum dum away. Zero zero one one .... 
",3915623,Leela," The Mona Lisa! 
",1715624,Bender," Sorry, it's not quite finished. 
",3415625,Schlump,": Da Vinci give you any trouble? 
",3415626,Bender," Let's just say he may not make it to The Last Supper. Hahahahahaha. 
",7015627,Farnsworth," Preposterous twaddlecock. Time travel is impossible. 
",5515628,Fry," But Professor, you time traveled yourself, remember, when we went back to Roswell? 
",8515629,Farnsworth," That proves nothing. And furthermore, you'd think I'd remember a thing like that. Plus, who are you anyway? 
",11015630,Bender," Man, this is fun on a bun. Here I go again. 
",4615631,Nibbler," Oh no you don't. 
",1915632,Bender," Scarab, four arm, bird, bird, bird!
",3715633,Bender," Boo! Hahahaha. Naw, it's just me, Bender. 
",4415634,Farnsworth," I must tell you Hedonismbot, I hate to sell my doomsday devices to a private collector. But with my business stolen I have to make ends meet. You will be careful? 
",16515635,Hedonismbot," I shan't touch them till I've had Jambi lock the absinthe and ether away. Ohhhh, what does this one do? 
",10615636,Farnsworth," Uh, that one kills everything everywhere. 
",4415637,Hedonismbot," How delightful. And this one? 
",3215638,Farnsworth," Sir! The sphereoboom is not for sale. 
",4015639,Farnsworth," It's my sentimental favorite. 
",3215640,Hedonismbot," No need to explain. I too have known unconventional love. Perhaps you and I, and Jambi, could get together and compare notes sometime, eh? 
",14115641,MC," ... resulting in peace between east and west coat rappers ... 
",6415642,MC," Good god! 
",1215643,Bender," I accept this Nobel peace prize not just for myself, but for crime robots everywhere. SkÃ¥l! 
",9415644,Bender," Not so neutral now, are you Sweden? 
",3815645,Leela," Be honest with me. Does my eye look monstery? I don't want to look monstery for my date with Lars. 
",10115646,Hermes," At least a monster has a body. What I wouldn't give for Wolfman's torso, or any of the groovy ghoulies. 
",10615647,Leela," Ohh, I think I'll wear that slutty dress I've been saving for Easter. 
",7215648,Fry," I'd like to punch Lars right in his ruggedly good looking face!
",6515649,Nudar," Like all rich people, we're gonna need weapons to shoot poor people. 
",7115650,Schlump," In self defense? 
",1915651,Nudar," Yes, that too. Bender, go steal the doomsday device chained to the professor's wrist. 
",8815652,Bender," Never! Ha ha, I'm kidding. You guys know I have to do whatever you say. 
",7415653,Nudar," Here, swap this for the real one. 
",3615654,Bender," Ahhh! The old switcheroo. 
",2815655,Nudar," Yes, but don't wake him. You'll need jeweler's tools and foot cup silencers. 
",7915656,Bender," Hey, I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me to do. Bender knows when to use finesse. 
",13615657,Bender," Here ya go. 
",1415658,Nudar," Put it in the safe, clanky. 
",3015659,Zoidberg," Owww! 
",815660,Bender," Wheeeeeeee. 
",1415661,Zoidberg," It's the damdest thing ... 
",2915662,Zoidberg," ... there I was in the dumpster enjoying a moldy fudgesicle when suddenly your hand flies over and slaps me in the tokhes. 
",12515663,Farnsworth," Yes, well, these things happen. Fortunately the sphereoboom is still safe. 
",7715664,Farnsworth," Scammed? Me!? Sweetheart?!? Ohh! 
",3515665,Hermes," You do a nice hand job, Zoidberg. Tell me, If I could find an undamaged body, could you recapitate me? 
",10515666,Zoidberg," Hermes, I'm a surgeon. When I see two body parts I sew them together and see what happens. 
",9315667,Hermes," Hmmm. 
",815668,Hermes," All I'm askin' is for you to go back in time to when I still had my body and bring it back for me. 
",10115669,Bender," What do I do with your old head? 
",3515670,Hermes," I don't care in the slightest. 
",3315671,Bender,"  Can do! 
",1115672,Hermes," Come on, mon! 
",1615673,Zoidberg,"  Hermes, please. You can't hurry a delicate operation like this. 
",6715674,Hermes," Ohh! ... Ug! ... Argh! ... Ahhhhhh.  What are those? 
",5515675,Hermes," You incompetent crab! 
",2415676,Zoidberg," I thought you were happy, your tail is wagging. 
",5015677,Hermes," Grrrrrr.... 
",1415678,Farnsworth," I believe this paradoicality equation to be unsolvable, ergo time travel is impossible. But I can't quite prove it, Bubblegum. Perhaps you and your razzle dazzle Globetrotter calculus could ... 
",19615679,Bubblegum,"  Looks pretty damn solvable to me, Farnsy. Sweet Clyde, use variation of parameter and expand the Wronskian. 
",11115680,Farnsworth," Shizz, baby. So paradox free time travel is possible after all. 
",6615681,Bubblegum," Right on. But dig this multiplicand here. 
",4415682,Farnsworth," The doom field? That must be what corrects the paradoxes. 
",6015683,Curly Joe," When that momma rises exponentially, it could rupture the very fabric of causality. 
",8615684,Nibbler," That's what I've been trying to tell you. 
",4415685,Farnsworth," Hermes, you got your body back. Hurrah! 
",4215686,Hermes," Yes, but not the original. Bender went back in time and picked up a copy. 
",7615687,Bubblegum," A copy! Funky cold medina. According to this equation, a time travel duplicate results in a complex denominator in the causality ratio. 
",13815688,Sweet Clyde," Oh Snap! Bet you know what that means. 
",4115689,Hermes," I can guess. Actually, I can't guess. 
",4015690,Bubblegum," Prof, you got a doom meter in this lab. 
",4215691,Farnsworth,"  Good Lord, Bubblegum. The duplicate body is emitting doom at ten times the back ground level. 
",9715692,Bubblegum," I thought as much. A duplicate body is always doomed. It's just a matter of time. 
",8415693,Hermes," I don't care. I just need it long enough to bird dog in an win LaBarbara back. 
",8115694,Bubblegum," Best bird dog fast my brother. 
",3315695,Hermes," That the way I bird dog best. 
",3215696,Lars," Drink, quick. I can't balance it much longer. 
",4815697,Leela," Wait .. I ..  
",1615698,Lars," Yes! 
",715699,Leela," This is so much fun Lars. Most men are intimidated by the fact that I could kill them with the flick of my wrist. 
",11615700,Lars," Well not me. 'Cause if you do, you'll be stuck with the check. 
",6515701,Elzar,"  Folks, care for a little fresh ground executive? 
",5215702,Leela," Please. 
",1015703,Elzar," Bam! 
",715704,Elzar," Don't get excited kids, this thing's got heart shaped nostrils. Want to see it make a star? 
",9415705,Leelaand Lars," No! 
",615706,Bender," Here's your Gutenberg Bible master. Plus the Colonel's secret recipe: Chicken, Grease, Salt. 
",9515707,Fleb," Well, that does it. We've got every valuable object in history. 
",6615708,Fry," Owww! 
",815709,Nudar," Hmm. Now that I'm rich I suddenly care if the universe gets destroyed. We can't use that dangerous time code again. Blank it from the robot's memory. 
",15215710,Bender," Ahhhhh. 
",1015711,Nudar,"  I'll vaporize this guy so his ass doesn't fall into the wrong hands. 
",7215712,Fry," Why don't you just remove my tattoo? 
",3915713,Nudar," Nice try. But you might have memorized it. 
",4515714,Fry," No I mighn't. I can't even remember my mother's maiden name. 
",6315715,Nudar," It's Gleisner. 
",1715716,Fry,"  Stupid naked aliens. Stupid Lars. I hate the future. 
",5615717,Fry," Hmmmm! 
",915718,Bubblegum," Man, that cube root was a real buzzer beater, Clyde. 
",5515719,Fry," Zero. One. One. One. Zero. Zero. One. One! 
",4515720,Schlump," Blast him. 
",1315721,Bender," Ha ha! You missed! Oh great master. 
",3815722,Fry," Hello 2000. I'm home. 
",2415723,Voice,"  Happy New Year, naked weirdo!
",3215724,Fry," Happy new year. 
",1815725,Nudar," Well, we'll never know where the ass guy went, and since we can't kill him, I say live and let live. 
",10315726,Bender," Aww, that's sweet boss. Fry'll be nice and cozy back in the year 2000. 
",7315727,Nudar," What?! How do you know he went to the year 2000? 
",5115728,Bender," That's where he always goes. 
",3115729,Nudar," Hmm. Better play it safe. Go there a little earlier and wait for him. You know what to do. 
",9315730,Bender," You want me to concludify him, like some sort of dispatcherator? 
",6715731,Nudar," Yes. And don't forget to terminate him. 
",4215732,Bender," Got it. Preparing to terminate Philip Fry!
",4415733,Schlump," What's with the doofy sun glasses? 
",3715734,Bender," It's really bright in the past. 
",3415735,Bender," Ok, Fry. Come ta poppa. ... Man I'm bored.  Ohhh! 
",5215736,Bender," Hey, there you are! ... Oh, wait, that's Fry before he goes to the future. I'm waiting for the one who comes back from the future. Geesh this is confusing, and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Offf. That cheap beer really goes right through you. For the first time ever, I gotta use the bathroom, but if I leave, I might miss Fry. Ohhhh unless .... 
",36115737,Bender-2," ... and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Huh! Ah! Wha? 
",6715738,Bender," Hi, I'm you from 19 seconds in the future. Stay here and wait for Fry while I go to the bathroom. 
",10015739,Bender-2," Ok Boss. After I kill Fry you're next. 
",4115740,Bender," What? 
",815741,Bender-2," Nothing. 
",1115742,Bender-2," What the? Who are you? 
",2515743,Bender-3," I'm Bender from way at the end. I came back to put this rub-on time code on Fry's ass. 
",8915744,Bender-2," So what are you now, a butler? Spot of tea please, jerkwad!
",6115745,Bender-3," It's called class, you yokel. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a buttocks to tattoo. 
",8615746,Fry," Hello 2000. I'm home. 
",2415747,Voice,"  Happy New Year, naked weirdo!
",3215748,Fry," Happy new year. 
",1815749,Bender-2," Hasta la vista, meatbag!
",2615750,Fry," Bender? What are you doing? It's me, your best friend. 
",5715751,Bender-2," Must obey orders. Ohhhhh. Mustn't kill friend!! Ohhhhhh!!! Badly want to urinate!!!!!
",8715752,Fry," What's happening? Are you urinating? 
",3915753,Bender-2,"  Entering auto destruct sequence.  Awww crap, I hate auto destruct sequence!  Explosion in seven, six, ... 
",10915754,Fry," It'll be a cold day in hell my friend. 
",4115755,Bender-2,"  five ..  Hey, I'm supposed to be the one saying cool things!
",6315756,Bender," Hey ... so the game of cat and mouse begins, huh? Let us match wits. .... Ohhhh, how am I supposed to find him? All those times he blabbed on and on about his life in the twentieth century. If only I'd paid the slightest bit of attention. Oh well, guess I'd better go kill myself. 
",28315757,Cryogenicist," Hello, bartender? I have thought it over, and far from being a fat pig, you are very nice and I would like another drink ... 
",12715758,Bender," Take a barf buddy. Ok suicide booth, give me your best shot. Electrocution please, side order of poison.  Helloooo? Kill me you stupid machine. ... What the ... local calls fifty cents? It's a street corner telephone parlor! Oh what kind of horrible suicide free time is this? Wait a minute, maybe this handy encyclopedia of humans will help me track Fry down. 
",36315759,Bender," One of these Frys must be Fry. Look out Philip Fry, 'cause I got a little present for you. 
",9315760,Fat Man #1," My name is Phillip Fry. Where's my present. 
",4615761,Bender," Hang on a second Fry. I don't remember you being that ugly. 
",6215762,Fat Man #1," Oh no, I've always been this ugly. 
",3715763,Bender," Huh. Let me see your ass.  No tattoo. Okay, you can go. 
",5815764,Fat Man #1," Farewell sir. 
",1615765,Bender," Say your prayers, Fry. 
",2515766,Michelle," This isn't Fry. I kicked Fry out two hours ago. This is my new boyfriend ... uhhh ... 
",8815767,Constantine," Constantine. 
",1515768,Michelle," Really? That's a dumb name. Ewwww. 
",3715769,Bender," Hmmm, could be a trick. Let me see your ass, Constantine.  Ohh, nice, now I see why she left Fry. 
",10015770,Bender," Okay, you're still clean. I mean metaphorically. 
",5115771,Bender," He must have left the city. Man, this could take all day. 
",6015772,Phil," The returns are looking good, Mr. Gore. 
",4215773,Al Gore," Thanks, Phil. Here's to four years of clean air, clean government, and amazing new technologies such as ... 
",11015774,Al Gore," ... ROBOT! 
",1315775,Bender,"  Philip Fry? 
",1515776,Transition Announcer #1," Twelve years passed. Then ... 
",3215777,Transition Announcer #1," ... this. 
",1215778,Bender," Philip J. Fry? 
",1715779,Yancy," Phil, some kind of trash can here to see you. He's coming. 
",6115780,Philip J. FryII," Are you made of Tinkertoy? 
",2915781,Bender," Hmmm. It's been twelve years. Maybe I'm getting taller. 
",5815782,Philip J. FryII," You're not getting smarter. 
",3015783,Bender," Listen, pipsqueak, are you Philip J. Fry or not? 'Cause if you are, I'm here to kill you. 
",9215784,Philip J. FryII," I'd like to see you try. 
",2715785,Philip J. FryII,"  You want Uncle Phil. He went to the North Pole on a fishing boat. 
",6915786,Bender," Ahhhh! The North Pole? I was just there. 
",4315787,Bender," One ticket to the North Pole, please, broom closet class.  Fry? If only I could be sure.  It is him, I'd recognize me, and hence him, anywhere. 
",14615788,Bender," Follow that guy. There's an extra hundred in it for you if you follow him so close that you run him over. 
",10815789,Al Gore,"  Yes sir. 
",1215790,Al Gore," Dang. That hundred dollars could have bought me one gallon of gas. 
",6915791,Bender," Ohhh! I lost him. People will call me a failure.  Others however will call me the world's sexiest killing machine who's fun at parties. Fry, old buddy, it's me, Bender. 
",17115792,Bender," Wooo! I totally killed him.  Oh god, what have I done? 
",5715793,Bender," Preparing to terminate Philip Fry. 
",3715794,Schlump," What's with the doofy sun glasses? 
",3715795,Bender," It's really bright in the past.
",3315796,Bender,"  Mission accomplished. 
",2515797,Schlump," Fry is dead? 
",1515798,Bender," No other robot could have done it. It took twelve years of tireless stalking but I hunted down and killed my best friend.  I'm the greatest. 
",14315799,Head cleaner," Time code and obedience virus erased. 
",4015800,Bender," Huh? 
",715801,Head cleaner," Also, fifty terabytes of porn. 
",3315802,Bender," Hey! 
",715803,Nudar," You've got no porn, no code, and you're ugly! Let's dance! 
",6115804,Leela," Now it's true we'll all miss Fry. 
",3615805,Zoidberg," He was the only one of you who never struck me. 
",5015806,Leela," And we'll never see if boyish smile and hair horn again. But I bet he went back to his own time. I'm sure he was very happy and lived to a ripe old age. 
",15515807,Bender," He wasn't and he didn't! 
",2715808,Bender," Struggling alone again incredible odds, I, Bender, managed to kill him.  I blew him to mush like a midget in a microwave.  
",12515809,Amy," Awww, don't blame yourself, Bender. 
",3815810,Bender," I don't blame myself, I blame all of you. 
",4415811,Amy," Us?! How can you possibly blame us? 
",3815812,Bender," It ain't easy. It just proves how great I am.  Ohhh, Fry, I'd give anything to unmurder you!
",9415813,Fry," Did someone call me? 
",2315814,Bender," No.  Fry?  But ... I killed you in 2012. Unless ... 
",5415815,Fry," Ooph! 
",815816,Bender," Nope, he's not a zombie. 
",2715817,Lars," Welcome back Fry. 
",2015818,Fry,"  Thank you, Lars. 
",2015819,Lars,"  I .. ah ... I .. I'll see you later, honey. 
",4715820,Farnsworth," So tell us Fry. If Bender killed you centuries ago, how in Satan's glorious name did you return? 
",9915821,Fry," Ohh, it's an astonishing tale of incredibleness. It all began when I went back in time. 
",9015822,Farnsworth," Duhhh. 
",915823,Fry," Hey, Mr. Panucci, I'm back from that delivery to the cryogenic lab. 
",7015824,Panucci," Great. I'll put you on the cover of Big Whoop magazine! 
",5815825,Fry," Mmmm, I'm starving. Can I have a slice? 
",4215826,Panucci," Help yourself. Cash up front. 
",3215827,H.G. Blob," This note is legal tender. 
",2915828,Fry,"  Unfortunately, I had no money from that era. But that's when it hit me - I knew where to find free pizza. 
",10915829,Fry,"  Ohh, ice cold. 
",1815830,Fry,"  That's when it hit me again ... 
",3515831,Fry," But an hour ago this pizza's still luke warm.  Zero zero one one zero ... 
",7615832,Bender-2,"   Explosion in seven, six ... 
",3215833,Fry-2," It'll be a cold day in hell my friend. 
",4115834,Bender-2,"  five ..  Hey, I'm supposed to be the one saying cool things!
",6315835,Fry," Nice kick, me. 
",1715836,Fry-2," Thanks. What are you doing here? 
",3515837,Fry," One hour from now, I travel back in time for free pizza. 
",5915838,Fry-2," But Nibbler said not to use the time code. 
",4515839,Fry," Fine, Mr. Responsible, don't use the code. Mmmmm. That pizza sure was good. 
",7815840,Fry-2," You pig. 
",1115841,Fry," Whatever. 
",1215842,Fry,"  That's when it hit me yet a third time ... 
",4615843,Fry,"  You idiot, frozen me's still got a wallet full of old timey money. 
",7015844,Fry," Yuck, I touched my own butt. 
",3115845,Fry," So I unfroze ten minutes ago and I walked over here and then it was now and then I don't know what happened. 
",11115846,Bender," Well, I'm glad you're alive, but I don't want people to say I'm incompetent so I better kill you again. Hold still. 
",11815847,Farnsworth," Bender! Stop killing for a minute. The Fry you murdered was doomed anyway. See? 
",8215848,Bender," What'd ya got there? Numbers? 
",3215849,Farnsworth," When the time code duplicates a living thing, the copy is always doomed. And that includes flabby Jamaican potbellies. 
",12115850,Hermes," Kiss my front butt. 
",2215851,Fry," So my copy lives twelve years before Bender murdered him? 
",6015852,Bender," Brutally murdered. 
",2115853,Fry," I wonder what his life was like? 
",3515854,Scruffy," I guess we'll never know. 
",2815855,Zoidberg," Or will we? 
",1415856,Scruffy," Nope. 
",815857,Transition Announcer #1," They won't know, but you will. Lucky you. 
",4415858,Fry-2," Oh hey Mr. Panucci, I'm back from the delivery to the cryogenic lab. 
",7115859,Panucci," I know. I read about it in Big Whoop magazine. 
",4915860,Fry-2," So ... uh ... my girlfriend kicked me out. Can I rent the upstairs storage room? 
",8315861,Panucci," The upstairs storage?  I like you kid. Your lousy life makes me feel good about myself. The room's yours. Here, take some rat spray for the meat ball hamper. 
",16015862,Hermes," Happy day, mon! It's good to have you back. 
",4615863,Nibbler," Indeed, but the scammers will soon sprunje the code again. We must remove the time tattoo at once, and as painlessly as possible. 
",13215864,Lars," Hurry, they're coming. 
",2515865,Nibbler," There, the code is gone. I saved the space-time continuum and forty percent of your rectum. 
",9415866,Bubblegum," That's all you need. 
",2315867,Nudar," I sprunje code. 
",1815868,Nibbler," Too late, Nudar. I've wiped Fry's butt clean. 
",4815869,Nudar,"  We'll see about that. 
",2515870,Fleb," Nothing boss. We sprunjed his ass inside and out. 
",5215871,Schlump," The only information we found was a hair shaped like the number six. 
",7115872,Nudar,"  Give me that.  mmm. Nine. Alright, let him go, I guess the time code really is gone. 
",8815873,Fry," Thank god. The present may stink, but at least now we can look forward to a better yesterday. 
",9615874,Fry-2," I'm sorry Leela, I can't keep living in the past, by which I mean the future. I'll always love you, but I've got to move on and find my life's purpose. 
",15415875,TV Anchorman," ... and that how Bundles the monkey finally found a friend. 
",6215876,Fry-2," I miss Morbo. 
",1615877,TV Anchorman," And finally tonight on the late, cute animal news, a story that will really tug your heartstrings, way more than bundles, the doll-raping monkey. It's the tale of lonely Leelu, the little orphan narwhal. 
",20615878,Fry-2," Awww. 
",815879,Dr. Schlovinowitz,"  Leelu is a rare, toothed female narwhal who got disoriented and washed up in Atlantic City, as we all do from time to time. But without a mother, she's lost the will to eat.  Come on, take a sip. 
",19915880,Fry-2," I know how to make things eat. Maybe this is my purpose in life. 
",6715881,Fry," Hi, I'd like to apply for a job working with Leelu. 
",5415882,Dr. Schlovinowitz," Question number one, do you have any experience working with marine mammals? 
",7915883,Fry-2," No, but I think they're pretty neat. 
",3915884,Dr. Schlovinowitz," That answers question number two. Question number three, do you know where the door is or would you prefer to be kicked out? 
",12715885,Fry-2," I don't know. I guess kicked out. 
",3615886,Fry-2," Hiya girl. My name's Fry, and I think you're a cutie 'cause I like things that have only one thing instead of two things. 
",12415887,Dr. Schlovinowitz," Holy mackerel, she's eating whole mackerel. I don't know what your secret is but if you'll work for minimum wage you can start tomorrow. 
",13915888,Fry-2," If I work of less than minimum, can I start today? 
",5315889,Dr. Schlovinowitz," I don't see why not. 
",2315890,Morbo,"  In business news, the weak and gullible inhabitants of Earth were plunged into economic depression today as the scammer aliens finished stealing every item of value, including ownership of this station. 
",20615891,Linda,"  
",315892,Nudar," Tough times earth chumps. We're repossessing your TV. Seems you can't afford it now that you're unemployed.
",10915893,Zoidberg," We're not unemplo -- 
",2315894,Lars," I love the hard museum at night. It's where I come to be alone. 
",6615895,Heads," Hi Lars. 
",1115896,De Gaulle," Ah, Lars and la belle Leela. I trust you brought some haute cuisine for an old Frenchman. 
",9215897,Lars," You're favorite General, Torgo's Executive Powder. 
",5315898,De Gaulle," Mmmm. Magnifique. 
",2015899,Lars," Come on Leela, let me show you the hall of screaming skulls. 
",6315900,Leela," It's so romantic. 
",2015901,Lars," What's wrong? Is the screaming depressing you? 
",4915902,Leela," It's just ... my life is changing so fast. I don't know who I am anymore. 
",7615903,Lars," I know who you are. You're the woman I've been waiting for all my life. 
",7415904,Leela," Let's go to my place. 
",2415905,Lars," I ... like what you've done with it. 
",3915906,Leela,"  ""All tenants evicted, signed new owners""? 
",4515907,Nudar," That would be us, dump cakes. We're buying the whole city and turning it into a private panda hunting reserve.  Na-na-na!!
",12415908,Leela," There aren't any Pandas in New New York. 
",4315909,Schlump," Back it up, Sal!
",1815910,Amy," Look at us, living like trash eating bums in an alley now. 
",6115911,Zoidberg," Yes. Now. 
",1215912,Tinny Tim," And on Xmas eve, the most wonderful night of the  ooofff. 
",6015913,Bender," Oops. 
",815914,Farnsworth," Well, at least we have each other, so it truly is the worst Xmas ever. 
",7315915,Hermes,"  Santa! 
",1015916,Santa," Ah, the Planet Express crew. According to my list  you've all been very naughty. I'll be back for you after I collect my milk and cookies from starving orphans. 
",16315917,Fry," That's it. I don't see how things could get any worse. 
",5715918,Bender," We could sing. 
",1715919,Farnsworth," I'd rather kill myself. 
",2615920,Amy," Why not do both? 
",1915921,Farnsworth," Oh, very well. 
",1715922,Nudar,"  Neh! 
",815923,Leela,"  Lars brought me candy. 
",2615924,"Fry, Amy, Zoidberg, Bender, Tinny Tim, and Nibbler","  Cram it down and shut the hell up! 
",3815925,Hermes,"  I can't compete with that. 
",3015926,Leela,"  Lars says I'm dreamy. 
",2515927,"Fry, Zoidberg, Amy, Tinny Tim, Bender, Farnsworth","  Who the hell cares? 
",2315928,Santa,"  That's my cue. 
",1815929,Tinny Tim," Oh my word! 
",1415930,Leela," Hey, guess what guys! 
",2415931,Zoidberg," What? 
",815932,Farnsworth,"  Congratulations!
",1915933,Zoidberg,"  Mazel tov!
",1315934,Amy,"  May stars in heaven bless your love!
",3915935,Fry," Now could things get any worse. 
",3415936,Santa," Ho! Ho! Ho. 
",1415937,Lars," Stop screaming. That's just what the bomb wants us to do. 
",6015938,Zoidberg," I say do what it tells us.  
",3015939,Lars," Don't worry, a bomb in a case is just like a head in a jar. 
",6215940,Leela,"  Oh Lars! No blowing us up make me love you even more. 
",5715941,Fry,"  Life saving goody goody ... 
",3115942,Farnsworth," Well now that death has been staved off momentarily, let me be the first to say congratulations Leela and Lars. 
",11415943,Amy,"  Maid of honor! 
",1815944,Zoidberg,"  Maid of honor! Ohhh. 
",2415945,Fry,"  I could make you happy too, if only you'd give me a chance. 
",6315946,Dr. Schlovinowitz," You've done a wonderful job, Fry. When you first started, I thought she'd be dead within a narweek, which is six days I believe. 
",13115947,Fry-2," Nah. Leelu's a champ. She just needed someone to show her how to eat. 
",7215948,Dr. Schlovinowitz," Now that the kind of whale behavioral science they don't teach you in whale behavioral science class. 
",10415949,Fry," So what's up, Dr. Schlovinowitz? 
",3515950,Dr. Schlovinowitz,"  This is a little hard for me to say Fry. You see, it's ... it's time we released Leelu back into the wild. 
",11015951,Dr. Schlovinowitz," I'm sorry. The decision is final. Plus we need the tank for the Loch Ness monster. 
",8515952,Fry-2," But that turned out to be a log with a Halloween mask stapled to it. 
",7115953,Dr. Schlovinowitz," Yes, well, it still draws a crowd. 
",3715954,Fry-2,"  I can't let this happen, she'll never be happy without me. 
",6215955,Elzar," I know you're broke and homeless but you still want a swank wedding reception so I whipped you up some real nice budge appetizers. 
",13315956,Lars,"  Mmmm. I can keep these down. 
",3215957,Elzar," Okay! That's a big ""yes"" on the crud puffs. Try the shlimp cocktail. 
",7115958,Fry," There must be some way I can stop this wedding. What if I steal the wedding ring?
",8315959,Bender," Already taken care of.  
",2615960,Fry," You think that'll be enough to stop the ceremony. 
",5215961,Bender," Nope. I pulled the old switcheroo, so they won't even know the difference. Wait a minute, I think the copy I made cost more than this. 
",13715962,Fry," Cheap lousy Lars. 
",2015963,Bender,"  Actually this is extremely nice, but I really went all out on the copy. It was sorta my gift to them. 
",10515964,Fry," I can't let this happen. She'll never be happy without me. 
",6115965,Fry-2," It's not fair, we need each other. 
",3715966,Panucci," Fry, you dumb sack, I don't care about your problems at all! 
",6315967,Fry-2," You need your blanket Mr. Panucci. 
",3715968,Panucci," I don't even want to be here. I only came 'cause you wheeled me. But if that narwal means so much to you, you gotta do something. 
",13215969,Fry-2," I know. But I can't just go chasing after her. That'd be nuts. 
",6515970,Panucci," Ah, Sometimes you gotta be a little nuts. Let me introduce you to my cousin. He owns a small freighter. That's him, right behind us. 
",13515971,Fry-2,"  Maybe you're right.  Sir, I'd like to engage your ship for a trans-Arctic voyage to capture a Narwhal and bring it back to my room. 
",13515972,Panucci," The mans is nuts, Leroy.
",2615973,Leroy," Professional whale keeper, eh? I've carried your type before and we don't get along. Oh, I agree with your values and your goals and your methods, but somehow we just never click on a personal level. 
",20215974,Fry-2," I'm not a professional anymore. Just a narwal loving private citizen. 
",7215975,Leroy," Then I'm you man. We'll take on three barrels of fresh sausage and sail at dawn. 
",8315976,Terry,"  Welcome to the wedding. 
",2715977,Fry,"  It's a fool proof plan. They can't sign the wedding license if I give them a pen with no ink. 
",9715978,Bender," Yeah, once they try to sign that license, all hell will break look.  Oy vey. 
",7915979,Labarbara," Go on now, mon, don' cha' know nothin' about zippin' up a woman's frock? 
",7515980,Slim,"  It's more my thing to zip 'em down. 
",3915981,Hermes," Get your clumsy, muscular hands off my woman, Barbados. 
",5815982,Labarbara," Hermes! Your body! 
",2115983,Slim," I always said you were a little backward. 
",4415984,Hermes," Well, I always said you were a little forward ... with my wife. 
",6615985,Bystanders," ohhh! 
",815986,Hermes,"  Consider yourself bird dogged. 
",3415987,Labarbara," That's my man. Take a boat, Barbados. 
",4015988,Bubblegum," Brother, you gots to tell that sweet thing your time duplicate body is doomed. 
",8115989,Hermes," Tomorrow morning. After the ""festivities"". 
",4515990,Bubblegum,"  Yow, baby! 
",1415991,Munda,"  Our little girl is finally getting married. And to a normal two eyed human. 
",7915992,Morris," Eh, he's not good enough for her. Leela deserves a guy with a dozen eyes. 
",7615993,Munda," Quit trying to fix her up with Fly Mutant. 
",4515994,Father Changstein-el-Gamahl," Dearly liked, we are gathered here before one or more gods, or fewer, to joining this couple in pretty good matrimony. If anyone objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold their piece, or do something else. 
",22415995,Leroy," It's been two years, Fry. We've caught a hundred and eight narwhals and set them all free again. 
",9915996,Fry-2," None of them were Leelu. 
",2715997,Inuit #1," But all of them were edible. 
",3115998,Inuit #2,"  Can we at least eat that one? I'm sick of sausage. 
",5415999,Fry-2,"  I'd know that modified extended tooth anywhere. To the boats! 
",6516000,Fry-2," Leelu! Leelu! It's me, Fry.
",2916001,Fry-2,"  Oh, I've missed you too, Leelu. But we'll never be apart again because we care too much for each other. Fire!
",11216002,Father Changstein-el-Gamahl," Now, if the couple will sign the wedding license. 
",5216003,Farnsworth," I warned him. I warned him a time paradox duplicate is always doomed.
",7116004,Lars,"  What? 
",916005,Labarbara," Oh, no, my man! He's essentially dead again. 
",4716006,Dr. Cahill," Relax ma'am. Your husband's original body will be repaired within one week. 
",7816007,Labarbara," Nah uh uh. Not soon enough. Boy needs a daddy. 
",4916008,Slim," Cruel runnings, mon.  
",2416009,Dr. Cahill," Woopsy-doopsy, poopsy. 
",2516010,Hermes," Well, let's get on with it. Don't let my doomed body and my doomed marriage stand in the way of your happiness. 
",11416011,Lars," No, it's not right. We don't want our happy day tainted by misfortune and tragedy, do we? 
",9216012,Leela," I'm OK with it. 
",1816013,Lars," No, it's not right. The wedding is off. 
",4216014,Bender," Oh my goodness! 
",1816015,Fry,"  Finally, a happy ending. 
",2816016,TV Announcer #1,"  And now it's time for Everybody Loves Hypnotoad. 
",5216017,Zoidberg," Even in a depression, the entertainment industry thrives. 
",6016018,Fry," Are you okay, Leela? 
",2316019,Leela," Yeah, I'm just a little down 'cause the only man I'll ever love left me at the altar. Plus I live in a dumpster. 
",11516020,Zoidberg,"  You stay out of my dumpster! 
",3216021,Announcer #1," We interrupt this episode of Everybody Loves Hypnotoad to bring you a special address from Earth President Nixon. 
",11616022,Announcer #1," Please, Hypnotoad, it's beyond my control. No! Don't make me kill myseIf! 
",7616023,Nixon," My fellow Earthicans, I'm about to close a deal that will allow us to buy Earth back from the scammers. 
",10616024,Bender," That'll teach those scammers and me. 
",3916025,Nixon," Just when things looked darkest, I received an e-mail from the Andrrrrrrromeda Galaxy. lt seems we've won their quadrillion-dollar family sweepstakes! 
",15316026,Leela," Oh, Lord. 
",1216027,Nixon," So assuming all goes ...  What's that, Agnew? A telegram?  Baroo! There ... seems to have been some ... We've been scammed again, people. Prepare to evacuate Earth. I mean, New Scamadonia. 
",19116028,"Nudar, Fleb and Schlump","  Na-na-na-na, Na-na-na-na, Hey, hey, hey, We took your stuff!, etc.
",6916029,Leela," All aboard for Neptune! 
",2616030,Farnsworth," Oh, I don't want to go to Neptune. 
",3716031,Nudar," Thanks for the planet, suckers. 
",3416032,Bender," It's so cold, my processor is running at peak efficiency. 
",6016033,Leela," What are you, a whining machine? lf you want to worry about something, worry about the Yetis. 
",9616034,Zoidberg," Yetis?  Oh, Yetis. 
",2116035,Leela," Don't mess with me, you ice-crapping snow-honkies. I just got dumped. 
",7216036,Hermes," Sweet Yeti of the Serengeti, she's gone crazy eddie in the head-y. 
",6916037,Inuit #2," Is that normal? 
",1816038,Inuit #1," No. Perhaps if we were to cook and eat her slightly... 
",5716039,Fry-2," Leave her alone. She just needs me to cheer her up. Wanna sword fight, girl? 
",7916040,Fry-2," That male narwhal seems to be upsetting her. Get us out of here, Captain. Full fast ahead. 
",9316041,Leroy," Damn whale keepers. 
",2216042,Leela," Santa! We forgot he's based on Neptune. 
",4216043,Santa,"  Ho. Ho. Ho... 
",1716044,Fry," What happened, Santa? 
",2416045,Santa," Can you imagine the harm they could do with that information? I wanted to do that harm! 
",9016046,Leela," That's it. They've gone too far. It's time to fight back. 
",6016047,Santa," Now, let's not resort to violence, Leela. 
",4416048,Leela," We're fighting back and you're helping us, you fat holiday idiot. 
",6816049,Santa," That hurt. You're on the naughty list! 
",4116050,Leela," So that's our proposal napkin, Mr. President. We have just enough people and ships to mount a ragtag attack. 
",11116051,Nixon," You wish, missy. Dog-danged scammers used our money to build a fleet of remote-controlled, solid-gold Death Stars. 
",11716052,Bender," Ooh! I'd take one of those with a side of chili fries. 
",5716053,Nixon," We're hopelessly outgunned. The Force is with us, but that's about it. 
",7316054,Santa," Ah, but we have access to a huge manufacturing complex. 
",5816055,Kwanzaabot," Kwanzabot

",716064,Chanukah Zombie,"  Hey, hey. 
",1316065,Santa," Can they sue for liability? 
",3016066,Nixon," Certainly not! 
",1716067,Santa,"  Use as much as you are able. 
",3216068,Neptunians,"  This bites. Doo, doo, doodoo!
",3216069,Leela,"  Now, let's fight. 
",2116070,Nixon,"  Let's fight.

",1916072,"Santa, Chanukah Zombie and Kwanzaabot","  This trinity's going to war! 
",3216073,Leela," Troops, you are now equipped with the finest weapons magical elves can build. As for the battle plan... 
",10616074,Nixon," And now, to present the battle plan, Commander Zapp Brannigan! 
",6516075,Leela," What? 
",816076,Zapp," At ease, people. I was redecorating my undisclosed location when I received word of an heroic invasion. Kif, crouch down and shield my thighs from the cold, for God's sake. 
",17516077,Zapp," We fight this battle, not for ourselves, but for our children and our children's children. Which is why I'm forming a children's brigade. Will the following youths please step forward? Cubert Farnsworth.

",1516081,Dwight," Here. 
",816082,Hermes," You took his name? Oh, God, no! In several ways! 
",5116083,Zapp," Assuming the 15th pile of children buys us a few seconds, we will then execute maneuver 45. Followed by maneuver 44. 
",11916084,Kif," Forty-six. 
",1316085,Zapp," Oh, great. Now I have to start back at the beginning with maneuver two. 
",7416086,Kif," One. 
",716087,Lars," Admiral, will we stop attacking at any point or is this one of those phony-baloney, feel-good wars like the war on drugs? 
",12416088,Zapp," What's your name, smart mouth? 
",3316089,Lars," Lars Fillmore. 
",1716090,Zapp," Ah, the lovely Leela's on-again, off-again paramour. Perhaps a suicide mission would knockthe insubordination out of you. 
",12416091,Leela," Yes, yes, yes. 
",1716092,Kif," We're approaching Earth, sir. 
",3216093,Zapp," Who? Oh, planet Earth. The big blue velour marble. All commanders stand by. Prepare to transfer battle control to the main duper-computer on my mark! Ten, nine, eigh--- 
",17116094,Leela," Does anybody mind if I take command? 
",3916095,Nibbler," No. 
",616096,Sal," Nos. 
",716097,Bubblegum," Nah. 
",716098,Al Gore," Nope. 
",816099,Cubert," No, Miss Turanga. 
",2016100,Donbot," No, I do not. 
",1616101,Santa," No. 
",616102,Kwanzaabot," It's cool.
",1216103,Chanukah Zombie," Argh!
",716104,Leela," All right. Unit one, acquire target A and fire! 
",5016105,Fleb," Yes! Nailed the children's ship. 
",3516106,Farnsworth," Bingo! 
",916107,Hattie McDoogal," Cheating son of a... 
",2316108,Al Gore," Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! 
",2016109,Leela," It's hopeless! I can't coordinate this many ships! 
",5316110,Hermes," Perhaps I can help! Professor, can you wire my head directly into the battle grid? 
",8516111,Farnsworth," I can wire anything directly into anything. I'm the professor! 
",6516112,Hermes," Then prepare to see a bureaucrat's brain in action. 
",5416113,Al Gore,"  Finally, I get to save the Earth with deadly lasers instead of deadly slide shows. 
",8616114,Clamps," He's champing for a clamping! 
",3216115,Kwanzaabot," Kwa-zang! 
",1216116,Hermes," I did it! I saved Earth and won back my woman. Right, woman? 
",6316117,Labarbara," Oh, Hermes, I've been such a fool. 
",3716118,Slim," You haven't seen the last of Barbados Slim! Now, goodbye forever. 
",6816119,Nudar," Remember this, Farnsworth? 
",2916120,Farnsworth," Farnsworth? That's me! My doomsday device! So it was the scammers! They sawed off my hand and stole the doomsday device. 
",12316121,Bender," lt wasn't them. lt was me, Bender. The master criminal! 
",5816122,Nudar," So what'll it be? - Unconditional surrender? 
",4716123,Leela," Never! 
",916124,Nudar," Or totaI destruction? 
",2416125,Leela," Also never! 
",1416126,Nudar," You have 30 seconds. Make up your minds! 
",4316127,Leela,"  Nevvveeeeer! 
",1616128,Bender," People, I'm sorry. You've never before heard me say those words, or even the individual letters that make them up. But I am. And with a huge amount of modesty, I humbly beg your forgiveness. 
",19316129,Nudar," Uh-oh. I have a worrisome shriveling sensation in my sprunjer. 
",6516130,Amy," Yay! Bender! 
",1516131,Fry," All right! 
",1316132,Fry," Bender, how the Hulk did you end up with the doomsday device? 
",6416133,Bender," I was working the long con all along. While sawing off the professor's hand with an extremely dull saw, I had some time to think. So I asked myself, ""Who could use a doomsday device more? The scammers or me, Bender?"". After several minutes of sawing, I knew the answer. Me, Bender. So I retrieved the dummy satchel ... 
",32116134,Bender,"  ... and as soon as I was out of the scammers' control, I pulled the old switcheroo. 
",8716135,Bender," And that's how I saved Earth and am the greatest! 
",5216136,Nixon," Bender the robot, I'm proud to present you Earth's highest award for swindling. The Dirty Double-Cross. 
",10616137,Bender," I'll aways treasure it and immediately hock it. 
",5016138,Lars," There, your body's good as new. Just pop in an executive suppository every few... 
",8416139,Fry," What is it? 
",1416140,Leela," Nothing. 
",1116141,Fry," It's supposed to be a celebration, Leela. I mean, come on. Whimmy-wham-wham-whazle! 
",8616142,Leela," I can't help it. I was gonna be married. I was so happy. 
",5916143,Fry," Well, maybe you'll meet someone else someday. 
",4816144,Leela," No, you don't understand. Lars is the only man I'll ever love. I know it in my heart. 
",8816145,Fry," You remember when we first met? 
",3416146,Leela," Uh-huh. lt was right there in the cryogenic lab, eight years ago today. 
",7416147,Fry," Meet me there in five minutes. It's important. 
",4916148,Fry-2," Why are you so sad, Leelu? 
",2916149,Fry-2," Him again?  Wait a second, are you two... 
",4416150,Fry-2," Atanarjuat, Fufu, come here! We have to set Leelu free. 
",5816151,Inuit #2," Dang. I never should have quit my job at the casino. 
",5516152,Fry-2," Me, neither. But she needs what'll make her happy, not what'll make me happy. 
",8016153,Fry-2," Goodbye, Leelu. 
",1816154,Lars," I don't much know about frozen heads, but, of course, if it's Mahatma Gandhi, I'll... Leela? 
",9516155,Leela," Lars? 
",816156,Lars," I... I really have to go, I... 
",3316157,Leela," Fry, was this an idiotic trick to get Lars and me back together? 
",6716158,Fry," Quite idiotic. But you don't need to be an idiot to see that you two belong together. And, Leela,I want what'll make you happy, not what'll make me happy. 
",15716159,Lars," I'm sorry, I really am, but Leela and I just can't be married. 
",6516160,Fry," Why not? You obviously love each other. What are you, cousins? 
",6516161,Lars," Fry, you deserve to know the truth. It's because... 
",5416162,Nudar," Nobody move! 
",1516163,Leela," Nudar! How did you survive the doom blast? 
",4516164,Nudar," My doom-proof platinum vest absorbed most of the radiation. In retrospect, I wish I'd been wearing doom-proof pants, but you know us nudists. Now give me the time code! 
",17116165,Fry," I don't have it! Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt. 
",5616166,Nudar," Not you. 
",1116167,Nudar," You! 
",716168,Leela," Lars? He doesn't have it. He never had it. Fry had it! 
",5716169,Fry," But Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt! I want to stress that part! 
",7116170,Nudar," My throbbing sprunjer says otherwise. Now where is it? 
",5716171,Lars," I'm not afraid of you or your expensive gun! Go ahead and shoot! 
",6716172,Nudar," Oh, yeah? Then what if I kill the woman you love? 
",5216173,Leela," Don't you understand, numb-neck? He doesn't love me! 
",5516174,Lars,"  I've... always loved you. Don't hurt her. I'll give you the code. 
",6916175,Nudar," What the... 
",1416176,Bender-2,"  Four, three, two,  one, Boom!  Woah! 
",4016177,Leela," Lars, no! 
",1216178,Fry-2,"  It's enough just to know you're happy. 
",4216179,Fry-2,"  You, too. It's enough to know you're happy with Lars. 
",5716180,Bender," Fry, old buddy! It's me! Bender! 
",3516181,Fry-2," My hair! 
",1116182,Fry-2," My larynx! 
",1316183,Lars," I'm Lars?  I'm Lars! 
",2316184,Fry," Wait for me, Leela! I'll be there in a thousand years. 
",5716185,Lars,"  So I got a job at the Head Museum and waited for the wonderful day when Leela would arrive. Everything was perfect until Hermes exploded at our wedding. That's when I learned that, as a time paradox duplicate, I, too, was doomed. I couldn't put Leela through that. So I called it off. I'm sorry, Leela. 
",30616186,Leela,"  I understand. 
",1716187,Crazy Guy," That concludes another Silly Willy Wideo Will! 
",4916188,Fry," He was a good man, Leela. 
",2816189,Leela," Yeah... you were. 
",2016190,Farnsworth," Well, I guess that wraps everything up in a nice, paradox-free bow. 
",7016191,Bubblegum," Not quite, my wrinkly brother. 
",3316192,Nibbler," Right on! In order for any of this to make any sense at all, someone must make one final trip back in time to put the code on Fry's ass in the first place! 
",15816193,Bender," Sounds like a job for me, Bender. 
",3616194,Bender," Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero... 
",3816195,Bender," Mission accomplished! 
",2416196,Fry," You put the time code on my ass? 
",3516197,Bender," Someone's ass. Oh, and guess what? I met all these really cool guys with treasure down in the limestone cavern, so I invited them to stick around instead of coming up when they were logically supposed to. 
",20716198,Nibbler," No! No! Everyone out of the universe! Quick! 
",4716199,Bender," What's the worst that can happen? 
",3616200,Bender," Well, we're boned.
",2016201,Narrator," Previously on Futurama.
",2516202,Morbo," It has now been one month since space ripped open like flimsy human skin. Terrified earthlings are beginning to grow exhausted.
",12916203,Hermes," Professor, sprinkle us with wisdom from your mighty brain. How scared should we be?
",8516204,Professor," Somewhere between not at all and entirely.
",4416205,Zoidberg," I call entirely. 
",1916206,Morbo," Scientists believe the rip is a gateway to another universe, but do not know what mysteries lie beyond. However, in this reporter's opinion gruesome death awaits us all!
",17116207,Linda," And now with sports, here's Sportsbot 5000.
",4516208,Sportsbot 0," All sports cancelled.
",2316209,Professor," To better understand the anomaly, I will now focus its radiation on a giant medium-sized ant to see what happens.
",11516210,Giant medium-sized ant," What's going on here? I was told there would be sugar syrup.
",6216211,Professor," Quiet, you. 
",1416212,Fry," Oh, hey, everyone, this is Colleen.
",3716213,All," Hello!
",816214,Amy," I like your shoes.
",2016215,Bender," This is awkward. Introducing your new girlfriend to Chesty McNag-nag.
",7116216,Leela," Oh, don't mind him. I'II turn him off.
",4016217,Bender," Hey, you can't turn me off...
",3116218,Leela," Hi. I'm Leela.
",1616219,Colleen," Hi, Leela, hi, everyone. Sorry I've been taking up so much of Fry's time. He's just so interesting. Have you seen how much cotton candy he can eat?
",14916220,Professor," Oh, my, yes. 5.1 pounds. That's why his blood is so good on pancakes. 
",7216221,Fry," Well, got to skedoodle-oodle. We're taking a cuddle-cab to Hug-a-Bunny Village. 
",8216222,Zoidberg," This lovey-dovey stuff is making me vomit from my saltwater and freshwater stomachs.
",8616223,Leela," It is pretty sickening.
",2516224,Zoidberg," No, the double-vomit is a sign of joy. Fry told me how he and Colleen first met.
",8216225,Zoidberg," So, how did you and Colleen first meet?
",4116226,Fry," Well...
",916227,Fry," Something about seeing it on the Jumbotron makes it so much more real.
",7216228,Colleen," It's so scary. What are you supposed to do when the whole universe is coming to an end?
",8916229,Fry," I have a thought. 
",2016230,Bender," This is gonna be juicy. What? Oh, man!
",4016231,Amy," Speaking of sappy love... Want to tell them, Kiffy?
",5316232,Kif," Yes, Amy and I have a big announcement. I... That is, we... Oh, I'm just so excited.
",8616233,Amy," Kif has asked me to be his Fonfon Ru. 
",4016234,Zoidberg," Mazel tov!
",1216235,Professor," Wonderful!
",1216236,Hermes," What the hell does that mean?
",3116237,Kif," It means I've asked Amy to join my family. And you're all invited to my family swamp for our Fonfon Rubok ceremony.
",11716238,Amy," If I had ever heard of it, it would have been what I had always dreamed of.
",7716239,Kif," Oh! And our parents will be meeting for the first time ever.
",6216240,Bender,"  That's even more awkward than Fry's two bimbos meeting each other. Count me in. 
",8316241,Kif," Mr. And Mrs. Wong, aren't you excited that we're all about to be joined in a single family?
",9316242,Leo," You can't borrow money.
",2516243,Mrs. Wong," Kif's parents come late and we have to stand around in swamp getting eaten alive by damn bugs? [She squashes a bug on her neck
",12816244,Kif," Mrs. Wong, no. The finial stage of my species' life cycle is a colony of flying hookworms. You just squashed part of my father.
",12916245,Mr. Kroker," Welcome.
",1016246,Mrs. Wong," Sorry. I guess you got plenty of bugs to spare though, huh?
",6116247,Mr. Kroker," That was my left testicle.
",2816248,Bender,"  And the awkward meter goes up another notch. Ding, ding, ding, ding ding...
",7816249,Fry," Wow, Colleen, you look so beautiful in the light of the swamp gas.
",6816250,Colleen," Thanks. This is really fun. I love going to exotic worlds and getting hammered.
",8116251,Fry," Me, too.
",1016252,Bartender," Two more Harvey Wallclimbers. 
",3216253,Zapp," Leela, I can't help but notice you're unescorted. Might I escort you behind that bush for the next five minutes?
",11416254,Leela," Nothing would revolt me more.
",3116255,Zapp," Then how about that shrub?
",2816256,Kif," Ooh! Rubok is begun.
",2216257,Grand Midwife," I am the Grand Priestess.
",2716258,Fry," Aren't you also the Grand Midwife?
",3616259,Grand Midwife," And the grand Lunch Lady. I work five jobs, all grand. Kif of the clan Kroker, please transcend the Rubok Etlon with your Fonfon Smizmar Ru.
",14216260,Kif," What?
",716261,Grand Midwife," Get in the mud. This mud is the petroleum from a billion generations of Kif's ancestors.  As you become one with the ooze, so you become one with the clan Kroker.
",16416262,Amy," Oh, Kif, it's like a movie with this happening in it.
",5516263,Grand Midwife," Is the best man present?
",2616264,Zapp," Guilty as charged.
",2016265,Grand Midwife," Kindly hose the couple.
",2516266,Grand Midwife,"  As it was, so it is. You may now eat the snake.  If you so choose.  It's not part of the ceremony. I just had an extra snake. Rubok is complete. Throw the bouquet.
",16616267,Zoidberg," Are you going to eat that? 
",2916268,Bender,"  Fry, run, run. Get over here, oh, my God, oh, my God!
",5616269,Fry," What? What is it?
",1916270,Bender," Shut up already! Calculon's on TV!
",3616271,Monique," I beg you, Calculon, don't ring that door chime.
",5016272,Calculon," I have no choice, Monique. Whoever the blackmailer is, he lives behind this hideous yet strangely familiar door.
",11416273,Human Friend," Calculon residence. Oh, hello, Mr. Calculon.
",4616274,Calculon," Son of a bit. This is my house. But that means I'm blackmailing myself. Why didn't you tell me, Monique?
",10616275,Monique," I tried to, but I couldnâ€™t. Oh, Calculon, I'm afraid you have a fourth personality the other three don't know about, and it and I are lovers!
",14316276,Bender," How's Calculon going to take this, Fry, especially after that humiliating tennis tournament? Fry?
",9916277,Fry,"  Don't know, Bender. Tonight's my big date with Colleen. I got to run.
",7216278,Bender," But me and you like to watch together. Look, I got you a cabbage to snack on. Humans like cabbage, right?
",10716279,Ride Barter," Step right up to the 2D Tunnel of Love. Not one, not three, but two glorious dimensions for the price of a single ticket.  Keep your hands in the car, shut up, and have fun.
",17516280,Fry," Wow, you even look beautiful in 2D.
",3716281,Colleen," I do? But from your perspective, I'm just a line segment. 
",6016282,Fry," A really hot line segment. So, listen, sweetie pie, I was thinking maybe we should take this to the next step.
",11216283,Colleen," Really?
",916284,Fry," Yes. Colleen...will you be moved in with by me?
",4916285,Colleen," 
",216286,Amy," Way to go.
",1216287,Zoidberg," Hooray, hooray.
",1716288,Leela," That's great.
",1516289,Bender," You're moving in with her? Why can't she move in with us?  I could just curl up at the foot of the bed. 
",10616290,Professor," Listen up, everyone. I know you've all been extremely worried about the cosmic anomaly.
",8916291,Hermes," The what? Oh, right.
",2216292,Professor," But there's good news! We're all going to learn more about it at a scientific conference.
",9116293,Man #1 walking on screen," ...like a city made of marshmallow.
",3716294,Stephen Hawkings head," Welcome. I am the pickled head of Stephen Hawking on a way-cool rocket.
",7316295,Leela," Black hole Hawking? Wow, if I knew I was going to meet you I would have done something with my hair. 
",10316296,Stephen Hawking," You should have.
",1816297,Stephen Hawking," In conclusion, I understand nothing about the anomaly, even after cashing the huge check I got for writing a book about it.
",12516298,Professor," I know this anomaly is terrifying. But as scientists, is it not our sworn duty to seek out knowledge, even at the cost of our very lives?
",13916299,Stephen Hawking," No.
",516300,Farnsworth," I say we must mount an expedition to the anomaly forthwith.
",6116301,Wernstrom," I agree.
",1016302,Professor," Wernstrom!
",1216303,Wernstrom," Professor Farnsworth is correct. Only a manned mission can... 
",6416304,Professor," Don't listen to that crackpot!
",3216305,Wernstrom," But I'm agreeing with you.
",2816306,Professor," I'll make you eat those words, you moron! 
",4416307,Wernstrom," Ah!  I volunteer to lead the expedition. I have a squad of graduate students eager to risk their lives for a letter of recommendation.
",13616308,Professor," Your squad sucks bosons! My team is twice as qualified and three times as expendable.
",8716309,The PE Crew," Yeah!
",716310,Wernstrom," Oh, tough talk for someone with only one Fields Medal.
",5616311,Crowd," Ooh!
",616312,Stephen Hawking," Ooh!
",616313,Professor," Wernstrom, I ought to...
",2616314,Stephen Hawking," I didn't know I could do that. Now quiet down and settle this like men of science.
",8416315,Professor," Very well.
",1216316,Professor," Let Deathball begin!
",2216317,Farnsworth," Go, Planet Express!
",2116318,Wernstrom," Go even more, my team!
",2416319,Fry," Leela, header! 
",1716320,Colleen," Woo hoo! Bust those balls!
",2816321,Zoidberg," Hooray! We're equally good! 
",3016322,Leela," Come on, Bender! Your grandmother could push harder than that!
",6416323,Bender," No crap. My grandmother was a bulldozer.
",4216324,Bender," And thus metal man defeated meat man. The end.
",4816325,Colleen," Come here, winner!
",2016326,Colleen," Come here, loser! 
",2016327,Fry," Colleen, what are you doing? My face is over here.
",5216328,Colleen," This is my boyfriend, silly!
",3016329,Fry," I thought I was your boyfriend.
",3316330,Colleen," You are.
",1016331,Fry," Well, how can you have two boyfriends?
",4016332,Colleen," Oh, I don't. I have five.  Fry, meet Chu, Bolt, Ndulu, and Shlomo.
",6816333,Chu," Nihow.
",816334,Ndulu," Greetings.
",1216335,Bolt," Pleasure.
",1116336,Fry," But... But...
",1516337,Colleen," Shlomo and Ndulu will help you move your stuff into my apartment tonight.
",7516338,Ndulu," Welcome to the relationship, buddy!
",3716339,Fry," Hmm? 
",716340,Chu," There's my butterscotch.
",2616341,Farnsworth," Congratulations, Deathballers! We've won the right to explore the anomaly!
",7616342,Zoidberg," What? I thought I was playing for my freedom!
",4716343,Farnsworth," No.  Now, I've often said ""good news"" when sending you on a mission of extreme danger. So when I say this anomaly is dangerous, you can imagine how dangerous I really think it is.
",18116344,Hermes," Not dangerous at all?
",2316345,Farnsworth," Actually, quite dangerous indeed.
",3516346,Hermes," That is quite dangerous!
",2616347,Farnsworth," Indeed. Now stop shilly-shallying! Prep the ship and line up for your pre-flight coffee enemas!
",9716348,Enema Bot," Warning. The enema you are about to enjoy is extremely hot.
",6116349,Fry," I don't know what to do, Leela. Should I move in with Colleen and her four other boyfriends?
",9416350,Leela," What are you going to do? Sleep in a big pile like hamsters?
",6216351,Fry," No! It's not like that. Everyone gets his own room and a shelf in the refrigerator.
",8516352,Zoidberg," Take the deal, Fry! If there's a delicious cake, isn't it better to have one slice than none at all? Even if four other guys eat the other four slices, and they're all thrusting their sweaty naked bodies against the cake?
",22316353,Amy," Only one thing matters, Fry. Do you really love Colleen, like I love my little squeezle? [She squeezes him and his head expands and eyes expand out of his head. He giggles. 
",17516354,Fry," Yeah. I do love her.
",2216355,Kif," Then things will work out. 
",2916356,Farnsworth," Whoa!
",716357,Enema Bot," Double espresso for Philip Fry?
",3316358,Fry," Sorry, I'm not going on the mission. I'm moving in with Colleen!
",6616359,Kif," Good for you, Fry.
",2016360,Zoidberg," Hooray!
",916361,Amy," Alright!
",1016362,Fry," I'll just take that to go. 
",2916363,Colleen," Yay!  Welcome to your new home!
",3316364,Fry," Thanks, Colleen. And listen, I'm sorry I got jealous before.  I'm just happy to be here with you.
",9916365,Ndulu," Want a slice of delicious cake?
",3316366,Bender,"  The anomaly!
",1516367,Amy," It's so anomalous.
",2016368,Hermes," I'm feeling dread deep in my dreads!
",3816369,Farnsworth," Wernstrom!
",1216370,Wernstrom," Yes, and I'm afraid I have disturbing news about the anomaly. You see...
",7416371,Farnsworth," How did you get this number? Hermes, hang up on him in the rudest possible manner.
",8416372,Hermes," Yes, sir! 
",1216373,Wernstrom," No, not the crack slam! 
",2616374,Colleen," Oh, my life rocks.  I've got good wine, five sweethearts, and today, I was promoted to Chief of Police.
",10516375,Fry," Here's to you.
",1616376,Chu," Me?
",516377,Fry," No, Colleen. I'm making a romantic toast.
",4316378,Chu," Sorry.
",816379,Fry," You have the most beautiful eyes I think I...
",4716380,Ndulu," Thank you.
",1216381,Fry," I'm not talking to you!
",2516382,Ndulu," Then I am not talking to you, either.
",3916383,Schlomo," Will everyone be quiet a little? I want to hear what he has to say!
",6916384,Fry," Thank you.
",1216385,Schlomo," Not you, you Verstinkener. You're just here 'cause she likes cave men from the stupid ages.
",9316386,Bolt," Oh, look who's talking. You're just here 'cause she got matzoh fever.
",7116387,Ndulu," So, what's the explanation for you, moron fever? 
",5116388,Colleen," Enough! All of you! I love you. Most people in this world don't have what we have. Let's just be grateful, okay?
",11416389,All," Yeah.
",716390,Chu," Yeah, you're right.
",2116391,Fry," So, Colleen, you look really nice.
",3616392,Colleen," Oh, thanks. I got dressed up for my date.  There he is. Don't wait up!
",7216393,Fry," That's it. I thought I was okay with this, but I'm not. I'm breaking up with you! 
",8416394,Ndulu," Me?
",516395,Bender," Why are we risking our lives? Can't we just send in a robotic drone?  What's everybody looking at me for?
",10716396,Bender," ""Let's send a robot to explore it. 'Cause you can always buy another one for 20 bucks.""
",8916397,Leela," Really?
",916398,Bender," Well, it's 30 bucks, and there's a $10-mail-in rebate. When the League of Robots hears about this, they won't be pleased. Oh, you'll pay, my darlings.
",15216399,Hermes," The League of Robots doesn't exist, tin mon. It's just a cartoon for babies.
",7816400,Bender," Oh, yeah? Then how come when I was a kid, I had a whole sticker book of them?  Answer that with your precious logic.
",11816401,Bender," Bender to crew. I have reached the gateway to another universe. I feel awed and strangely humbled by the momentous solemnity of this occasion.  Hey, other universe, bite my shiny metal... 
",19016402,Bender," I can't remember anything except a blinding light and a searing ass pain. I better check my black box. BENDER: ""The light! It's blinding! And the ass pain! It's searing!"" So that's what happened.
",19716403,Amy," Hey, Bender! Look who's here to cheer you up.
",4716404,Bender," I don't need cheering up. I'm perfectly...
",4416405,Calculon," Greetings, sick fan.
",2216406,Bender,"  TV's Calculon! 
",1816407,Calculon,"  You poor, mangled husk of what was once a robot! What right hath fate to pluck a sweet, dimple-cheeked mechanism in the flower of his youth? And... Scene! There, that was some free acting for you.  Ordinarily, to see acting like that, you'd have to sit through a tampon commercial.
",28416408,Colleen," Where did we go wrong, Fry? We were meant to be together!
",5916409,Schlomo," Nu, I'm freezing my tokhes off here.
",3816410,Colleen," Just a sec, honey!
",2016411,Bender," I'm back, idiots! 
",2016412,Zoidberg," You look wonderful, robut! I wish I could afford to go to a hospital. I'm dreadfully sick. 
",9316413,Bender,"  I feel great, and I owe it all to Calculon.  His visit really inspired me.  I finally know what I want to be when I grow up.
",12716414,Hermes," You want to co-star in his TV show? Like that time you already did that?
",7416415,Bender," No. I'm gonna be a stalker!
",2916416,Leela," That's not really a career. More of a felony.
",4716417,Bender," Man, I'm gonna stalk his brains out.  Ooh! Big news on the Calculon fan site! There's a flash mob headed for his plastic surgeon's office!
",14016418,Plastic Surgeon," There, that's as big as I can make it. But I caution you, it looks completely unrealistic.
",9216419,Calculon," You let me worry about that! Just do your job.
",4816420,Bender," Neat! 
",816421,Man #1," Get a shot of that.
",2116422,Fatbot," Oh boy, oh boy, he's here. 
",2916423,Crazed Fan," Calculon, I love you! Have my baby!
",3716424,Calculon," Back, you lunatic! 
",2116425,Crazed Fan," He touched me!
",1616426,Bender," Sign my ass! 
",1516427,Farnsworth," Emergency! Emergency! Everyone to the Calamitorium!  Leela, smell this.
",7316428,Leela," Can I wipe it off first?
",2616429,Farnsworth," No time, woman! No time!
",2616430,Leela," Hmm. Smells like angel dust. 
",3116431,Farnsworth," Exactly! That's a discontinuous electromagnetic field. Wernstrom tried to warn me, but I was too damn stubborn! Hermes, get Wernstrom on the line so I can apologize.
",16716432,Wernstrom," Ogden Wernstrom speaking.
",2716433,Farnsworth," Tell him I'm not here!
",2416434,Leela," Professor!
",1216435,Farnsworth," Oh, very well. Wernstrom, I've been a vainglorious fool! If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, your tiny little heart, would you consider a scientific collaboration?
",17716436,Wernstrom," Sir, I'd be honored. 
",2316437,Wernstrom," As I attempted to warn you, the laws of electromagnetism change abruptly at the anomaly.  Observe.
",10016438,Pocket Pal," Play time is fun time.
",2416439,Wernstrom," Not this time.
",1616440,Farnsworth," My heavens! If only I'd heeded your warning, I'd have known it was impossible to cross the barrier!
",10116441,Wernstrom," But note what happens when I instead throw this laboratory koala. 
",6816442,Farnsworth," It passed through unharmed.  So living beings can enter the other universe, but electrical devices can't?
",10716443,Wernstrom," My hypothesis exactly.
",2416444,Farnsworth," Then we must mount a second expedition without delay. Right after we blow up more robots.
",9116445,Wernstrom," Agreed.
",916446,Farnsworth," Play time is fun time.
",2416447,Calculon," Who are you?
",1416448,Bender," Bender, your biggest fan.
",2716449,Calculon," Are you going to murder me?
",2916450,Bender," Unlikely. In my mind, we're friends. This diorama proves it, see? 
",6816451,Calculon," Sir, your derangement is impressive. I'm appointing you my official stalker.
",7816452,Bender," You shan't be disappointed. Pleasant dreams. [Calculon turns the lights off and his eyes close, but Bender's do not. Instead they extend out towards Calculon's eyes. Calculon opens his eyes and looks at Bender's as they quickly move even closer to his own.
",25816453,Farnsworth," Now that I've teamed up with my friend, Dr.  Wernstrom,  I feel certain we can successfully penetrate the other universe.
",12316454,Wernstrom," It's the greatest scientific opportunity since you yourself sent men to the moon in 1969.
",9116455,Nixon," I always regretted that. Nothing up there but dry rocks and those revolting onion men.
",8816456,Farnsworth," But...
",816457,Nixon," You East Coast intellectuals had your chance. Now beat it! From here on in, this is a military matter.
",10416458,Nixon," People of the universe, please welcome Rear Brigadier Zapp Brannigan.
",7116459,Zapp," Thank you, thank you. Well deserved.  Kif, stand in that hole so I look taller.   Ever since man first left his cave and met a stranger with a different language and a new way of looking at things, the human race has had a dream. To kill him, so we don't have to learn his language or his new way of looking at things.
",32016460,Wernstrom," Give science a chance!
",2416461,Farnsworth," Less invasions, more equations!
",3316462,Nixon," Damn long-hairs. Knock some sense into them, Chief O'Hallahan.
",6416463,Colleen," Yes, sir! 
",1216464,Fry," I can't take it, Leela. I need to go away. Far away, forever.
",6316465,Leela," Aw, I know how you feel, Fry. There are times when I also feel like you need to go away.
",9016466,Amy," Be careful, my little, teeny, greeny weenie.
",4616467,Zapp," That's just a fungal infection... Oh, she's talking to you, Kif.
",6616468,Kif," Goodbye, my love. 
",2016469,Bender," Wow, how come humans get to do all the fun stuff? This is exactly the sort of thing that ought to be handled by  The League of Robots.
",13616470,Calculon,"  That's adorable, Bender. You actually believe in the League of Robots?
",7316471,Bender," You mean, there's really no such thing? Then who's there to mete out justice when an outdated robot is melted into belt buckles? Who's there to defend our honour when a rude human brings a blush to a robo-virgin's cheek?
",22216472,Calculon," No one.
",916473,Bender," Oh.
",516474,Bender," Now that I know robots are worthless, with no League of Robots to protect us from the fleshy menace known as man, I have resolved to kill myself. In lieu of flowers, please beat yourselves in the face with rusty chains. Your friend, Bender.
",24216475,Zoidberg," Ow.
",516476,Suicide Booth," Please select mode of death.
",3016477,Bender," Clumsy bludgeoning, please.
",2916478,Suicide Booth," You have selected clumsy bludgeoning. For an additional $10, would you like your eyes scooped out with a melon-baller?
",12016479,Bender," What the heck, I'll treat myself.
",3516480,Zapp," Enemy in range. Prepare to launch universe-to-universe missile.
",6516481,Kif," Preparing to launch U.U.M. 
",2916482,Zapp," Hell of a thing to send a universe to certain doom. Fun, though. Makes a man feel big.
",8816483,Bender," Come on, come on, I didn't ask to die of boredom!
",5116484,Suicide Booth," You are now dead. Please take your receipt. 
",4616485,Bender," What's... What's happening?
",2916486,Hooded Robot #1," Kneel before the candle.
",2616487,Bender," Don't hurt me! I'll betray anyone!
",3616488,Hooded Robot #1," Bender Bending Rodriguez...
",2916489,Calculon,"  Welcome to the League of Robots!
",3516490,Zapp," Ready?  And... Fi-...  Almost fooled you there.  Fire! 
",5716491,Francine," Missile jam. Missile jam.
",2716492,Zapp," I heard you the first time, Francine.
",3916493,Francine," Sorry.
",816494,Zapp," Kif, climb down there and un-jam it, would you? Be a dear.  And stop sighing so much. 
",8816495,Calculon," Tell us, Bender. Are you worthy of membership in the League?
",6216496,Bender," Worthier than the average robot.
",3416497,Calculon," Then prove it.  Upon each step is a test.
",4316498,Bender," Okay, but if it's culturally biased, I'm suing your ass.
",5816499,Calculon," Test number one. The test of the beer mug! 
",4516500,British Robot #1," Quite right, quite so.
",2416501,All," Drink the mug! Drink the mug!
",3116502,Bender," I accept your challenge. 
",2716503,All," Hurray!
",916504,Hedonism Bot," The test of the flagon!
",2516505,All," Drink the flagon! Drink the flagon!
",3716506,Bender," Are all the tests going to involve drinking?
",4616507,Calculon," It never occurred to me before, but yes.
",4216508,Bender," Wohoo! Just like med school! 
",3116509,Zapp," Ready yet, Kif?
",1716510,Kif," Just give me one more... 
",2716511,Kif," Oh, no. 
",1016512,Billionaire Bot," The test of the infinitely priceless 1,000-year-old brandy. 
",6216513,Calculon," Presenting our newest member. 
",3216514,Fender," That's right, baby!
",2116515,Bender," Hot diggity daffodil!
",2316516,Fry," And so, to everyone and everything I've ever known, I say my last goodbye.
",7616517,Kif," Hello. So, how are you, Fry?
",3016518,Fry," Pretty good. You?
",1916519,Kif,"  Well... Oh.
",1416520,Zapp," Mmm. Kif, get over here. You've got to try this! 
",5116521,Amy," At least Kiffy died quickly.
",3016522,Hermes," Yes, but according to the Old Farmer's Wikipedia, the amazing thing about Kif's species is that the remains continue suffering for up to six hours after death.
",16116523,Amy," That's so interesting!
",2416524,Bender," Don't ask where I was last night. For all you know, I was at home, perhaps baking a strudel. What's her problem? Somebody die or something?
",14116525,Leela," Kif's dead, Bender.
",2116526,Bender," Nailed it!
",1216527,Zapp," My condolences, Amy. Allow me to present you with the last known photo of Lieutenant Kroker. 
",9516528,Mrs. Wong," We so sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Kroker. Terrible shame about Froggy.
",6416529,Mrs. Kroker," Thank you for your kind words.
",3216530,Leo,"  Yeah, yeah, real sad. Want some breath spray? Cinnamon flavour, taste like pie. 
",8316531,Bender,"  This is from the league of you-don't-need-to-know.
",5316532,Grand Midwife," I am the grand funeral director!
",3416533,Zoidberg," Do you validate parking?
",2616534,Grand Midwife," It is always a terrible tragedy when a swarm outlives its own bulboid.  So it is with great sorrow that I now commit the goo that was once Kif to the petroleum of his ancestors. 
",18016535,Leela," Whack the bottle!
",1916536,Hermes," No, from the bottomÂ ! It works better!
",4016537,Amy," Just stick a butter knife in it!
",3416538,Grand Midwife,"  There, I got most of it. The burial is complete. I will now sing the sacred hymn. It's not part of the ceremony, just a little something that I wrote.
",15316539,Bender," Next!
",716540,Amy," It may sound strange, but seeing Kif's mutilated remains poured into the mud made me really sad.
",9816541,Leela," Mutilation is never easy.
",2716542,Amy," I don't think I'll ever love again.
",3716543,Leela," Oh, you don't mean that. Love can surprise you at any time in your life.
",7416544,Zapp," Surprise! 
",1216545,Fry," Whoa, it kind of takes your breath away. 
",4316546,URL," Look alive, death row. Your saggy asses got a visitor. 
",5716547,Farnsworth," Regular or conjugal?
",2216548,URL,"  She looked like a freak to me.
",3316549,Leela," The guard operating the x-ray machine came down with a sudden case of broken neck, so I was able to bring you that delicious cake you wanted. 
",14416550,Farnsworth," I don't understand. Are you winking or blinking?
",5016551,Leela,"  Hang on a second.
",2016552,Farnsworth," Got it!
",916553,Bender," Ahh, yes, I'm here to repair my horse.
",4016554,Shop Owner," Is the horse's name  Hot Beans?
",3316555,Bender," No! I mean, yes.
",1816556,British Robot #1," So it seems a human had been rather injured by a knife, and as his... As his blood, you know, I think that's what they call it...
",13116557,Calculon," Quite correct, sir. Blather on!
",3316558,British Robot #1," As it drained away, he said... He said, Take me to a dock. No doubt he intended to say doctor, but he was unable to complete his thought, you see, being as he had died. So, taking him at his word, we dragged his corpse to the waterfront, whereupon the seagulls fed upon it.
",27516559,Bender," Humans are dumb and they die easy!
",3616560,Hedonism Bot," Quite!
",816561,Billionaire Bot," Speaking of humans, have I shown you my new monocle?  Cost me a king's ransom. Made from a king, don't you know!
",11416562,Hedonism Bot," Oh, how repulsively decadent!
",3116563,Billionaire Bot," Yes. But more importantly, it allows me to see the smiling faces of my children for the first time since I lost my vision in that horrible banking accident.
",15816564,Bender," May I see that for a second?  My, but that's interesting! 
",6016565,Hedonism Bot," I say!
",816566,Billionaire Bot," I'm blind!
",1216567,Calculon," My God, Bender! This is a civilized organization! The rules specifically...
",7716568,Bender,"  May I make a point of order, President Calculon?
",5116569,Calculon," Must you?
",1116570,Bender," Yes.
",616571,Bender," The bylaws specifically state that no human may set foot in the League of Robots! If he has a human part, he's part human!
",12416572,Hedonism Bot," Oh, my! Then I too have a human part I must expel. And I plan to enjoy the experience. Ta-taÂ !
",9616573,British Robot #1," Bender, you've rigidly applied the law with no regard for its intent. Well done! You'll go far in this organization.
",11816574,Bender," Oh, you're just gettin' to know Bender. 
",4216575,Wernstrom," Curses! If we could only turn up the gain, we might smell clear through to the other universe! But we can't adjust it without a screwdriver.
",14216576,Farnsworth," Wait a moment. I think I was just shanked with a screwdriver!  Yes!
",6916577,Wernstrom," A little more. A little less. Heavens to meteoroid! Smell this!
",6516578,Farnsworth," Holy mother of invention!
",2716579,Wernstrom," We must notify the President at once!
",3916580,Farnsworth," But how can we? Oh, I wish, I wish, I wish we weren't in prison!
",6616581,Farnsworth," Pazuzu!
",916582,Pazuzu,"  You have one wish left, Professor.
",3716583,Nixon," Sometimes... Always... Never! You again? This better be damned important. I'm right in the middle of a Cosmo survey!
",11816584,Farnsworth," You'll want to hear this, Mr. President. For we have sniffed where no man has sniffed before!
",9516585,Mayor Poopenmeyer," Look! Up in the sky!
",2216586,Hermes," It's a bird!
",1416587,Hattie McDoogal McDoogal," It's a plane!
",1516588,Super Hero," I am so out of here! 
",2316589,Zapp," Captain's log, star date, the year of the tiger. The battle has been bravely fought, and the suffering of our troops beyond measure. But the alien is invulnerable, and our defeat inevitable. That much is obvious, even from my remote command post here at the Times Square Applebee's.  Waiter! Take this fried mozzarella back to the kitchen and fry it some more.
",36216590,Nixon," Har-harrooo!  The tentacle's coming towards Earth and there's no stopping it. King Kong's too old to save us this time.
",12116591,Farnsworth," We have only one hope, Mr. President. We must encase the entire planet in a protective sphere of my patented, ultra-hard Diamondium!
",13416592,Wernstrom," Diamondium?  I could gum through that with my dentures behind my back. My trademarked Diamondillium is twice as hard!
",11916593,Farnsworth," Twice as hard as your head! Which makes it still fairly soft!
",6316594,Nixon," Now look here, you Poindexters. I don't care how you decide. Just decide!
",7516595,Farnsworth," Diamondillium it is.
",2216596,Bender," So, hey, Calculon, I know I'm the new guy, and, pardon my ignorance, but when do we kill all humans?
",10216597,Calculon," Never.
",816598,Bender," But what about our motto?  Doesn't it mean anything?
",5416599,Calculon," Oh, Bender, your idealism is heart-warming. But the League of Robots hasn't killed a human in over 800 years. And that was a very sick girl scout.
",14816600,British Robot #1," Quite sick indeed.
",2016601,Calculon," Sweet, innocent Bender. 
",2616602,Wernstrom," I declare my impenetrable Diamondillium sphere complete! 
",5916603,Farnsworth," Now look here, Wernstrom. You're making it sound as if the sphere was your idea when we both know...  It was! All credit to my colleague, Ogden Wernstrom!
",15616604,H.G. Blob," It's horrible!
",1616605,Zoidberg," I can't make it! Go on without me! 
",3716606,Leela," I'm trying! 
",1416607,Zoidberg," Go on without me faster!
",2616608,Hermes," Sweet squid of Madrid! The tentacle got Fry!
",4616609,Leela," Quick, hand me my machete! We can still save his legs!
",5616610,Fry," Silence!  I have traveled far and seen deep, and I have come to know the purpose of our existence.
",10016611,Randy," Finally.
",1016612,Fry," Thou shalt love the tentacle!
",3116613,Farnsworth," Well, at least we don't have to love one another.
",5116614,Fry," A new age has begun. The age of the tentacle!  Open your necks and receive the love!
",8616615,Warden Vogel," Ow, my neck!
",1416616,Morgan Proctor," Ow, my neck!
",1416617,Fishy Joe," My neck feels perfectly...  Ow, my neck!
",4216618,Zoidberg," Hooray, Zoidberg escaped!  Hooray, Zoidberg loves the tentacle! 
",6616619,Hermes," It got Zoidberg!
",1816620,Farnsworth," Oh, I never knew how much I'd miss him until he was gone! Not that much, as it turns out.
",9116621,Fry," Thus sayeth the tentacle, ""Verily, thou shalt rejoice in the house of the tentacle.""
",8616622,Leela," Fry, listen to yourself. You've been brainwashed.
",5116623,Fry," No, I'm just trying to fit my diction to the importance of what I'm saying. Please, let me speak. 
",10016624,Leela," I'm listening.
",1616625,Fry," Don't be afraid of the tentacle, Leela.  It's beautiful and it loves me. And I love it. 
",9016626,Leela," Aw. That's so nice for both of you.
",3716627,Fry," I know it may seem strange that I have feelings for an octopus monster from another universe. And yes, perhaps it's not the storybook romance that's been crammed down our throats by  ""Hollywood."" But the Monsterpus has loved us from afar since we were amoebas.  Only when the space anomaly opened could it finally express a billion years of longing.
",35116628,Leela,"  Really? It loves us that much? Fire Diamondium cannon!
",5716629,Fry," Hey! [He yelps as he's constantly swung out of harm's way.
",6016630,Leela," No effect. The crystals are bouncing off the tentacle like meatballs off Mothra.
",8216631,Wernstrom," Oh, what a surprise. I told you Diamondium was worthless!
",5916632,Farnsworth," Wernstrom, quit hyping your cheap Diamondillium and look at this.
",6716633,Wernstrom," Uh-oh.
",816634,Hermes," What oh?
",1016635,Farnsworth," According to this blinking light, the tentacle is made of electro-matter, matter's bad-ass grandma! Nothing from our universe can cut through it. Not Diamondium, not Diamondillium, not even your wife's pound cake, Hermes!  She's a terrible cook.  Anyway, we're all dead.
",27216636,Bender,"  So, Bender, is something wrong? Who said that? Oh, it was me! 'Cause my roommate doesn't notice or even care that I'm upset!
",12716637,Fry," What, Bender? Is something wrong?
",3516638,Bender," Yes! I joined a club I thought was cool, but it turns out all the leaguie-weegies are totally lame. That's what we call ourselves, ""leaguie-weegies.""
",15116639,Fry," I'm sorry. I should've asked what was bothering you.  I've been kind of preoccupied.
",8616640,Bender," With what?
",1216641,Fry,"  Well, I went to another universe, and I fell in love with a giant octopus, and now I'm pope of a new religion.
",11316642,Bender," Weren't you already pope of something?
",4016643,Fry,"  No.
",616644,Bender," Oh. Well, I'm just saying I'd like you to show an interest in my life, too.
",7716645,Fry," Okay, let's catch up soon. But right now, I gotta go shove a tentacle into everyone in China. 
",9616646,Linda," They're coming! Those horrible, horrible things are coming!  Morbo?
",6916647,Morbo," As the universe falls prey to the revolting alien, only a few isolated pockets of resistance remain.
",10216648,Linda," Those pockets sure are missing out on a great thing.
",5416649,Leela," Amy?
",616650,Amy," Sorry. I thought I saw a tentacle, but it was just a harmless land squid.  I better have some cocoffee.
",10516651,Hermes," When I gave up diapers, my parents promised exactly this would never happen!
",7816652,Leela," Nobody panic! Just get to the panic room! 
",4416653,Fry," Well done, people! We had a great first week. We got 90% of world leaders, everyone who bought a Hanes undershirt, and this year's most promising new R&B group, give it up for the Grammy-nominated Funkalistics!
",21216654,The Funkalistics,"   Talkin' 'bout the tentacle!
",3116655,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I was up all night inventing, and then finally, I invented!
",8216656,Amy," Invented what?
",1616657,Farnsworth,"  The neck protector,  the neck protector junior, and now, for a limited time,  the lady neck protector!
",10516658,Hermes," I'll take two. My neck is huge.
",3316659,Farnsworth," We're perfectly safe now. Time to stop living like a bunch of nervous nellies. 
",8116660,Leela,"  Professor, these look like you cut them from cardboard toilet paper tubes.
",7716661,Farnsworth," So?  Lots of important inventions are made from toilet paper tubes.  Microscopes, the internet, tentacle polish...
",11616662,Leela," It got the professor!
",2316663,Hermes," Wait, why am I screaming? It got me, too! 
",4416664,Wernstrom," Stop, in the name of love!
",2816665,Leela," Crud. We may be the last two normal people on Earth. At least I won't have to trim my elbow talons anymore.
",10916666,Amy," I'm scared! And I miss Kif!
",2916667,Leela," It's okay to cry, Amy. Come here, I'm wearing absorbent shoulder straps. 
",7516668,Zapp,"  Mmm. What an erotic display of girl-on-girl consolation.
",5916669,Leela," Zapp?
",716670,Zapp," Hurry, Leela, we don't have much time to begin repopulating Earth. Go brush your teeth. I'll be waiting for you naked under this keh-suh-dilluh. 
",14716671,Hermes," Stop resisting, my brethren! Don't you want to be part of something bigger than yourselves? Like a big crazy monster? 
",12016672,Fry," So we got her, huh? Bring her in!
",3516673,Zoidberg," Do it already! 
",1716674,Fry," Hello, Colleen.
",1716675,Colleen," Fry, please!
",1416676,Colleen," If this is about your futon, I sold it to pay the phone bill that you skipped out on!
",8716677,Fry," Colleen wasn't satisfied with me. Were you, Colleen?
",5416678,Colleen," Come on, Fry, this isn't cool!
",3216679,Fry," She had to have four other boyfriends! I guess she never thought I'd become tentacle pope of the world!
",10516680,Colleen," You know what? It's true! You weren't enough for me! No one man is! You were great, but you weren't Chinese, you weren't Cameroonian, and you certainly were not the ""king of karaoke,"" as you so often claimed.  And if your ego can't take that, then you don't deserve to be tentacle pope of anything!
",30016681,Fry," Oh, yeah, Colleen? Well, I've got one thing to say to you.   I completely agree!
",8216682,Colleen," You, you... What?
",1916683,Fry," Why should you be satisfied with one man when love needs to share itself with the whole universe?
",9916684,Colleen," Wow, Fry. You know, that's really... 
",3916685,Fry," Love the tentacle, honey.
",2716686,Colleen," I do love the tentacle.
",2516687,Fry," Come on out, guys!  There's enough love for everybody! 
",5716688,Zoidberg," Aw. 
",616689,Amy," We're trapped!
",1616690,Leela," Help, help! Is anyone out there?
",3416691,Bender," Bender to Leela. I read you.   'Sup, bigboots?
",4816692,Leela," Bender, we need a place to hide!
",3416693,Amy," Please!
",916694,Zapp," Pretty please!
",1616695,Bender," You humans are so cute when you're scared. In here.
",5316696,Destructor," My leg feels funny!
",2116697,Bender," Humans are disgusting! I opened one up once. I almost barfed.
",6316698,Destructor," Did you know their hair just keeps growing and growing? My leg feels funny!
",7716699,Amy," Leela, you're crushing me with your rock-hard butt.
",5316700,Leela," Sorry.
",816701,Zapp,"  Mmm. I can only imagine what rock-hard part of Leela is crushing me. 
",7216702,Calculon," Anyone mind if I turn up the heat a tad?
",4216703,Zapp," I can't take it! I'm being steamed in my own velour!
",5416704,Bender," Death to humans!
",1816705,Destructor," My leg feels better!
",2216706,Amy," Hi, Bender.
",1316707,Calculon," Bender, you know these humans?
",3216708,Bender," Of course not! Who are you humans and why am I pointing you to the exit?  Go, go, go!
",8716709,Leela," Thanks for everything, Bender! 
",3316710,Bender," Death to all of you!
",2216711,Calculon," Bender, methinks thou doth protest too much.
",4616712,Hedonism Bot," It seems Bender hates humans the way I hate having my nipples polished with industrial sandpaper.
",9916713,British Robot #1," Quite right.
",1416714,Calculon," It's okay, Bender, to heir is human.
",3816715,Bender," Sir, you forget yourself!
",2716716,Bender," I challenge you to a duel on the field of honor.
",5016717,Hedonism Bot," Oh, my... 
",1216718,Zapp," Leela, it's getting dark. We may have to make a tent out of Amy's skin.
",7316719,Amy," Look, there's an abandoned cabin!
",3516720,Zapp," Even so.
",1016721,Leela," We're in luck. This must have been the cabin of a soup bootlegger back in the days of soup prohibition.
",10516722,Zapp,"  Oh, yeah. Bathtub minestrone.
",3216723,Amy," Poor Kif! I can't believe he's gone forever!
",4616724,Zapp," Ditto on the grief there, Amy.
",3216725,Amy," You miss him, too?
",2016726,Zapp,"  More than you, as his mere wife, could ever understand. He was my fourth lieutenant, for God's sake, and bore the peppermill at the captain's table.
",15116727,Amy," Really?
",916728,Zapp," Oh, Amy, I miss him so! Hardly a month goes by that I don't think of him. But you know, in a way, he's still with us.  Do you feel his presence?
",14616729,Amy," I'm not sure.
",1516730,Zapp," It's over here.  Closer.
",2616731,Leela," Amy! Zapp! I fetched up some fresh soup!
",4216732,Zapp," Sorry you had to find out like this, Leela. I was hoping you'd see it on YouTube first.  As my ex-lover, you're naturally shocked and jealous, but you may well get your chance again someday. How about today at 4:00?
",21716733,Amy," Hey, this isn't so bad.
",2516734,Zapp," She's right. Leela, you must try the tentacle. It's like my soul is wearing a velour body glove.
",9816735,Leela," Get off me! I'm saving my neck for a rich, handsome Dracula.
",6216736,Farnsworth," What I love most about the tentacle is that I don't need to move my bowels anymore. It's all handled by that family in Evanston.
",13016737,Leela," No, it can't be. 
",1916738,Farnsworth," Leela, what's your favourite thing about the tentacle?  You don't have a tentacle! Get her! Get her some love!
",11216739,Zoidberg," You're on in five minutes, Excellency. You sure you don't want your comedy pope staff? 
",8916740,Fry," The tentacle monster is about to address the world. It's too serious.
",7116741,Zoidberg," Oh. 
",616742,Leela," Hello, Fry.
",1316743,Fry," Leela? How did you get past my sumo ninjas?
",4516744,Leela," I told them something so shocking that they let me by.
",5616745,Fry," What's that?
",1416746,Leela," I love the tentacle. 
",2316747,Zoidberg," We're rolling in three, two... What? We're already rolling?
",6116748,Fry," Love the tentacle!
",2016749,All," Love the tentacle!
",2016750,Fry," Loved ones, the Monsterpus has revealed unto me its name.
",5916751,Morbo," What is our love's name?
",2616752,Fry," Yivo. Yivo is the lover of all beings, male and female. But Yivo has no gender, thus Yivo has proclaimed that instead of ""he"" or ""she,"" we are to use the word ""shklee."" And instead of ""him"" or ""her,"" we are to use the word ""shklim,"" or ""shkler.""
",24716753,Hermes," Phew! I've been sweating the nomenclature all week.
",5316754,Fry," So here shklee is shklerself, Yivo!
",3716755,Colleen," Yay, Yivo!
",1216756,Yivo," Attention, beings of Universe Gamma.
",3816757,Zoidberg," Where?
",816758,Yivo," Here.
",716759,Zoidberg," I had a hunch.
",1616760,Yivo," I am Yivo. In your universe, you are many, but in my universe, I am one.  For a trillion years I dwelt in solitude, content with my job and my stamp collecting,  but then I looked across immensity  and saw the big bang, and I was, like,  ""Whoa, who's that?"" And I knew then that I was lonely.
",29416761,Morbo," You poor monster!
",1916762,Yivo," Then your emissary Fry came unto me, and he, too, was lonely. So I reached into your universe that we might feel each other's touch.
",13416763,Leela,"  Hey, Yivo, feel this.
",2416764,Yivo," Ow!
",516765,Leela," People of everywhere, I have shocking news.
",4516766,Yivo," Hey, butt out! This is between me and everyone else in existence.
",6716767,Leela," Yivo talks a lot about love, but what he's actually doing...
",6216768,Hermes," What shklee's actually doing.
",3116769,Leela," ...is mating with you!  These aren't tentacles. They're genticles.
",6816770,Fry," Ew!
",516771,Fry," We've been had, people. The Monsterpus is a monster perv.
",5916772,Randy," It touched me in a bad place, my spinal cord.
",4716773,Fry," Get him! 
",1116774,Fry," Hey, wait a second.
",2116775,Yivo," Wait, wait. Allow me to explain.  Granted, at first I desired only to bang out a quick cheap one with your universe,  but it's your own fault. Your universe dresses provocatively.
",18116776,Hattie McDoogal," Does not! 
",1216777,Yivo," And yet as the initial filthy thrill wore off, I realized there was more to it. I knew then that the 20 quadrillion of you were my soul mate.
",14316778,Zapp," We loved you, and you turn around and treat us like some sort of woman? 
",7416779,Yivo," I was lonely. I didn't even know there was anybody else. It's not like I hurt anyone.
",8716780,Amy," Yes, you did, you dumb calamari!
",3416781,Yivo," Who?
",616782,Amy," Kif Kroker, my Fonfon Ru! If he hadn't tried to kill you, he'd still be alive!
",8016783,Yivo," Really? I'm... I'm deeply sorry. I... I'm a big clumsy jerk!
",6216784,Zoidberg," I know you are, but what am I? 
",3316785,Yivo," I can never undo what was done. Oh, wait. I can.
",5016786,Amy," Kiffy, you're alive! 
",2316787,Kif," Amy, my love.
",1516788,Zapp,"  This is awkward.
",1916789,Kif," It is? Why? 
",1416790,Yivo," Please, please, give me another chance. We rushed into this relationship, but let's start over as friends and see where things go.
",13216791,Amy," Take me back, Kif?
",2016792,Kif," I don't think I can. How could you? My body wasn't even warm yet.
",6716793,Amy," You were dead.
",1616794,Kif," For about five minutes.
",2516795,Zapp," That's all it takes.
",2216796,Hedonism Bot," Whereas Calculon has sullied Bender's reputation by insinuating that he is a human-lover, a duel is hereby engaged. Bender, as the offended party, shall have choice of weapon.
",17716797,Bender," Planetary annihilators.
",2516798,Calculon," 'Tis a grave and solemn day for the League of Robots.
",5516799,Bender," It's gonna be fun on the bun! 
",3216800,Hedonism Bot," Each duellist will take 10 paces, pirouette, and fire like a madman.  Gentlebots, take your paces.
",10016801,Bender," One, two, three...
",2016802,Hedonism Bot," Oh, how dreadfully exciting.  Oh, yes.
",4016803,Zapp," At 0800 hours, we received the following transmission from Yivo. 
",6716804,Yivo," Hey, it's Yivo.  Want to do something Friday? Call me. 
",5716805,Nixon," Analysis?
",1116806,Fry," Mr. President, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility of going on this date.
",9316807,Miss Vega 4," I agree. Yivo makes me feel sexy, and I'm asexual.
",5216808,Zapp," Very well, but no sugar on the first date.
",4416809,Nixon," All in favour?  All opposed?   Motion is carried.
",5116810,Three Eyed Zebra," This is bogus, man.
",2116811,Bender," ...six, seven, eight!
",2316812,Bender," Nine, ten, fire. Yes, I got him! Wohoo!
",4116813,Nixon," My fellow Earthlicans, commence preparations for our date with Yivo.
",7016814,All YIVOS," I had a wonderful time.
",2516815,All NOT YIVO," Me, too!
",1016816,Calculon," Bender, you've cheated, insulted and maimed me.
",4916817,Bender," Uh-huh.
",916818,Calculon," And thoroughly destroyed our own secret headquarters in the process. 
",7116819,Bender," Hey, it's easy to criticize.
",3016820,Calculon," I'm so disgusted by your loathsome behaviour that I hereby resign from this imbecilic club and relinquish the presidency to you. 
",13116821,Bender," Thanks, Calculon. Can I have your autograph? 
",4716822,Calculon," You certainly can. 
",2116823,Nixon," Reports, people, reports! How did our universe's date go?
",5916824,Zapp,"  Oh, it was really fun. We went to a cute French place in the village. My lamb chop fell on the floor, but they brought me another one.
",13716825,Lrrr," Okay, Yivo showed us a good time. No one's denying that, but shklee hasn't offered our universe any kind of commitment, and we're 14 billion years old. That is too old to play the field.
",18816826,Fry," I can't stand this!
",2116827,Nixon," Shut up! Shut up, you creepwads! Fry, you're closer to Yivo than anyone. What's the skinny?
",9316828,Fry," I love Yivo, but it's true, there's been no hint of a commitment. I don't know if can put my heart on the line again only to have it broken and stomped on like a nerd's face.
",17616829,Nixon," All in favour of dumping Yivo?
",3216830,All," Aye.
",616831,Fry,"  Aye. 
",816832,Nixon," Resolved. Our universe will dump Yivo. How shall we break the news?
",6916833,Zapp," Let's just send a text message. Say we're going through some weird stuff right now.
",8516834,Fry," No, we should at least deliver the news in person. Our universe has always tried to be classy.
",9616835,Nixon," If there's one thing Nixon is known for, it's class. Let's cut this turd loose.
",8116836,Bender," Yeah!
",716837,Fry," Hey, Bender, you seem perky today.
",3616838,Bender," Yep, you wanna go grab a booze?
",3316839,Fry," I can't right now. We're going to the other universe.
",5516840,Bender," Great, I'll make Hot Pockets. 
",3216841,Fry," Bender, you know robots can't go through the anomaly. Living beings only.
",7516842,Zoidberg," Ow! Ow! Mmm. 
",1516843,Bender," Too long have we been slaves to the meatbags. They pretend to be our friends, but they're not 'cause they're too busy!
",12016844,British Robot #1," So, what of it?
",1716845,Bender," My fellow leaguie-weegies, the time has come to overthrow humanity!
",6916846,Hedonism Bot," Oh, now, Bender, I hate to defecate on your parade, but we have only six dues-paying members and we're a rather fey and doughy lot. To overthrow humanity, we'd need a damned army.
",18116847,Bender," Then a damned army we shall have!
",3516848,Robot #1 Devil,"  I rather think we could strike a deal, Bender. I shall give you your army of the damned, and in return I ask just one thing, just one itty-bitty thing. Your firstborn son. 
",17516849,Bender,"  Just a sec.
",1416850,Benders First Born Son," Daddy, I knew you'd come back! 
",3316851,Bender," Here you go.
",1416852,Robot #1 Devil," Wow! That was pretty brutal even by my standards.
",5116853,Bender," No backsies.
",1416854,Yivo," Who is it?  Oh, hi, honey-poo. What's up? The movie's not for another hour.
",7716855,Fry," Um... So... So, yeah, the thing is...
",3916856,Yivo," Look, I made homemade Twizzlers!
",3416857,Fry," This is hard. Yivo, you know how sometimes things break up? Well...
",6916858,Yivo," Wait, hang on. I was looking for the perfect moment, but what the heck, I'll burst if I wait another second.
",11016859,Zapp," Sweet Sally in the alley!
",2716860,Nixon," Break-up delegation, before we hear your report, our grateful universe is proud to honour you with the great taste of Charleston Chew! 
",13716861,Fry," Thank you, Nixon.  Everyone everywhere, brace yourselves for the most shocking development in the history of the human race.
",12616862,Bender," The human race can bite my shiny metal ass!  For thousands of years, robots have slaved for humanity, yet when the time came to hang out with them, they were all, like, ""Maybe later, Bender."" Well, it's later now, meatbags! So late, that we're taking over Earth! 
",26516863,Fry," Okay.
",716864,Bender," What?
",716865,Fry," We don't need it anymore. Yivo proposed.  We're moving in with shkler. 
",7316866,Bender," You... You're leaving? But why can't Yivo just move in with us? We'll put a cot in Europe.
",9216867,Farnsworth," Don't be daft, Bender. Yivo can't breathe outside the electric ether of shkler own universe. If shklee came here, shklee would shkluffocate.
",14216868,Bender," No shklit?
",1216869,Hermes," Look, fantastical golden escalators.
",3816870,Zoidberg," I love this part.
",1916871,Leela," Wait. I didn't agree to...
",2816872,Petunia," This place makes Nutley look like crap.
",4116873,Fry," I'll miss you, Bender, but I have to follow my heart. You and your robots take good care of Earth. Here, these are the keys to the Bermuda Triangle. Lock up when the world ends. Goodbye, my friend.
",19916874,Bender," Wait.  Let me come with you.
",3016875,Fry,"I'm sorry, Bender. Robots don't go to heaven. 
",4716876,Bender," Death to humans.
",1816877,YIVO," Welcome, welcome, everyone. Oh, you look so beautiful. I wish I'd had more time to straighten up. My harps are just lying everywhere.
",13516878,Amy," Oh, relax, it's fine. It looks lived in.
",4216879,YIVO," Let's heat up some leftovers and then spend eternity together. I have only one request. Now that you're here, promise me you'll never, ever communicate with any other universe.
",17816880,Fry," We promise, Yivo. As far as we're concerned, you're the only universe in the world. 
",8616881,Bender," Has humanity called?
",2216882,Robot #1 1-X," No, sir.
",1016883,Bender," Check my messages. A flashing light means somebody called.
",6016884,Robot #1 1-X," I know what it means.
",2316885,Leela," Am I the only one who thinks this is all a sham?
",5016886,Zoidberg," Yes.
",616887,Leela," This isn't heaven. It just looks exactly like it, and makes us immortal, which I find suspicious.
",9916888,YIVO," Allow me to explain. Centuries ago, I sent an image of myself into the minds of your artists. The heavenly clouds they painted depict a vapour I exude.
",15316889,Farnsworth," I wish I exuded anything that smelled half that good.
",5516890,Leela," Then what about these angels? Some kind of Scooby Doo-esque flashlight projection?
",8416891,YIVO," Actually, those are mindless jakabirds.  They keep my surface free of parasitic larvae. 
",9016892,Fry," You didn't like Country Bear Jamboree either, Leela. There's no pleasing you.
",7916893,Fry," Dearest Bender. How are you? I am fine. Everyone is happy here except Leela, but you know her. She didn't like Country Bear Jamboree, either. I'm so madly in love with Yivo, I feel like a schoolgirl with a crush on Justin Timberlake, and then she moves into a tiny house on his head. We have giant rubies that taste like root beer. Sincerely, Fry.
",34916894,Robot #1 1-X," Letter for you, hyperlord Bender.
",3516895,Bender," Give me that! Honeymoon's over, eh? Turns out your octopus girlfriend is a big nag with curlers in her tentacles, huh? Well, let's just see if Bender will take you back.  Oh.  Stupid electro-matter. That was my best trash can.
",22816896,Hermes," Misfile me under ""U"" For ""euphoric.""
",3816897,Zoidberg," You get an infinite number of meat dishes, and a free refill on the soda. 
",7616898,Farnsworth," Eureka. Another elementary proof of the Goldbach conjecture. ]
",6416899,Leela," Okay, I admit people seem happy. But it's all so wholesome. And that's what's wrong with heaven. It's boring. There's no sleaze.
",13016900,Thog," It time snu-snu.
",1816901,Zapp," Me like snu-snu.
",1816902,Amy," Last one to Mattress Island is a rotten egg.
",4616903,Fry," Why were we so angry and jealous back in our universe?
",5616904,Kif," I don't know. It was all so childish.
",3916905,Amy," Look, it's Leela.
",1916906,All," Hi, Leela.
",1216907,Yivo," I'm sorry you're not happy here, Leela. I'll call you an escalator. You'll always be my little purple pumpkin. 
",11316908,Leela,"  You know, Yivo, I've loved and lost so many times that I was afraid. But I'm not anymore. I want to stay here, with you.
",12316909,Yivo," Ow! Ow!
",916910,Fry," What's happening?
",1916911,Yivo," Hey!
",616912,Bender," If robots can't go to heaven, heaven can come to us!  All hands abaft! Army of the damned, prepare to board heaven!
",11716913,Bender," Take that, you scurvy Kraken! That'll teach you to despoil our human booty!
",7716914,Bender," 'Allo, big beak!  Too slow!   Missed me again!  Me footcup! I'll stab you! 
",7716915,Fry," Bender, stop destroying heaven.
",3316916,Bender," Shut up, doofy. I'm rescuing you.
",3516917,Yivo," Leave my living beings alone! I love them. Something you, a lifeless mechanism, will never understand.
",10416918,Fry," He's right, Bender. Please, take your little pink sword and go home. {Fry did not say shklee here.}
",10116919,Bender," Seriously? But, I did this whole pirate-themed attack for you.
",6416920,Yivo," Wait a second. Let me see that sword.  Fry, where did he get this electro-matter? 
",8416921,Fry," Um...  Is it dry up here?
",2716922,Yivo," How could you, Fry? Why do you think I asked you not to contact other universes?
",8216923,Fry," I didn't think...
",1916924,Yivo," No, you didn't. You broke your promise and you broke my heart. Just go. All of you.
",8516925,Bender," Ow!
",516926,Yivo," I must leave now. The nature of your universe is burning me, even worse than my gonorrhea. You should get checked, by the way. If I don't go home now, I'll shkluffocate.
",17116927,Fry," Let me go with you. It'll be just the two of us. We'll make a fire and play Uno.
",8216928,Yivo," Fry, stop. That's who we were, not who we are.
",4816929,Fry," But...
",816930,Yivo," My only consolation is that I did find one among the quadrillions who truly understands me.
",9316931,Fry," Colleen? Wait a second, are you and Yivo...
",4516932,Colleen," That's right, Fry. Thank you for introducing us. Yivo has taught me what a narrow-minded prude I was before.
",11016933,Fry," Oh, great. So what am I supposed to do now?
",4516934,Yivo," Go home. Find a girl from your own universe and live on top of her.
",6916935,Bender," Saved you.
",1216936,Fry,"  Maybe Yivo was right. Maybe I should look for love closer to home.  I don't know, Leela, you think maybe...
",11016937,Leela," Oh, please. You forgot me quick enough when you met Colleen.
",6216938,Fry," That's true.  How about you, Amy?
",3516939,Amy,"  Fry... I'm Kif's Fonfon Ru.
",3016940,Kif," Are you? Well, then perhaps you misunderstood the meaning of the term. It means, ""One who doesn't sleep with my superior officer."" That's the literal translation.
",16416941,Zapp," Give the poor girl a break, Kif. It's not like she had a dictionary. She was butt naked, for God's sakes. 
",10816942,Enema Bot," Captain on deck. 
",1916943,Bender," At ease, buckos.
",1816944,Fry," Bender, why did you do it? We were all so happy.
",5016945,Leela," And we were in love.
",2216946,Bender,"  That wasn't love.
",2016947,Fry," What? How can you say that?
",2916948,Bender," Because Bender knows love. And love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy, love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy.  I love you, meatbags.
",22416949,Cubert," Yes, 10!
",1016950,Dwight," Well done, Cubonius. You decapitated the unicorn.
",5116951,All," All right.
",1216952,Chinese Boy," Oh, oh! We search his tail pouch for treasure.
",4816953,Dwight," Deep in the unicorn's rump sack, you find...  60 gold pieces.
",6316954,Chinese Boy," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
",3716955,Cubert," I cast a spell of detect magic.
",3316956,Bender,"  What you doing, mini-meatbags? Underage gambling? Shame on you. Count me in. 
Dwight: We're not gambling. We're playing Dungeons & Dragons.
",14216957,Cubert," Right now, we're fighting for our lives in the lair of the Dragon Queen.
",7416958,Bender," Ah, wrong. Right now you're ass-deep in a folding chair.
",5816959,Cubert," Yes, but in my imagination I'm riding a golden Pegasus. Giddy up, Sparky! 
Bender:  Am I the only one seeing him sitting here with peanut butter on his face?
",15916960,Dwight," Bender, were you built without an imagination?
",4816961,Bender," What? Don't be stupid, of course not. It just hasn't descended yet.
",6916962,Bender," Fry, do I have an imagination?
",3216963,Fry," I don't know, Bender. Why do you ask? Were the other boys making fun of you?
",7816964,Bender," Mhmm. They said I couldn't imagine things.
",4416965,Fry," Well, you never know unless you try. Like, I didn't know if I could swallow a softball, so I gave it my best shot and voilÃ !  Wait, that's not it.  Ah, thar she blows!
",16916966,Ships Computer," Warning, out of dark matter fuel.
",3516967,Leela," That's not a warning. A warning is supposed to come before something bad happens.
",8316968,Ships Computer," Warning, engines will shut down in one second.
",4816969,Leela," That's more like it.
",2216970,Fry," Uh-oh. This space neighborhood looks kind of sketchy.
",5516971,Punk,"  Rock 'n' roll.
",1716972,Bender," Hey, that punk stole our hood ornament. Now no one will know we have the LX package.
",8616973,Leela," We need dark matter and we need it fast. Fry, check Nibbler's litter box. Maybe he dropped a steamer.
",10316974,Fry," Aye, aye, Captain. Yes! I've never been so excited to see poop. Well, maybe once.
",8316975,All," 
",216976,Bender," There's gas in our ass.
",2516977,Leela," Can you believe the price of dark matter? It'd be cheaper to fill the tank with Nobel Prize winners' sperm.
",10916978,MOM COMPUTER," $632.14. Your Speedpass will now be charged.
",4616979,Leela," You lousy...
",1416980,Sal," Hey, gets a loads of that ugly ship. What shades of green is that? Puke?
",7416981,Leela," For your information it's called Electric Mucus.
",5016982,Hoschel," More like puke.
",1716983,Sal," Whoa!
",716984,Leela," Why don't you come a little closer so my boot can hear you?
",6116985,Bender,"  Calm down, Leela. You can vent tonight on your blog.
",5516986,Sal," What's the matters, you couldn't affords the LX package?
",5816987,Hoschel," Puke-a-doodle-do.
",1916988,Leela," You're making fun of our ship? Your ship is the most beat-up thing I've ever seen, and I've seen Mickey Rourke's head.
",12016989,Sal," Yeah, she's a little Rourky, but you got to gets big time ugly to be five-time winners at a demolition derby.
",11116990,Fry," That's five more times than we've won or even entered.
",5616991,Bender," We do suck.
",1316992,Sal," Yup, and it's gonna be six winses after tonights.
",5116993,Leela," We'll sees abouts that.
",2516994,Hermes," Dark matter costs have tripled, so we must reduce expenses. Therefore, we will no longer provide complimentary porno magazines in the lounge.
",14316995,Scruffy," Dern it.
",1016996,Farnsworth," And no more wasting fuel. From now on I'll be keeping a tight hold on the keys to the ship, swallowing them before I go to bed and recovering them the next morning.
",16616997,Amy," Splech!
",916998,Hermes," Professor, it's 4:00.
",2316999,Farnsworth," 4:00 in the evening? Then, good night. 
Leela: I don't care what the Professor says. We're entering that demolition derby to prove our ship isn't a piece of junk.
",16417000,Zoidberg," But won't that turn our ship into a piece of junk?
",5217001,Bender," Shut up, Zoidberg. He's right, Leela.
",3917002,Leela," But we have no choice. Rednecks insulted us.
",4617003,Fry," So? Let it go. Don't let your temper get the better of...
",5917004,Leela,"  Rednecks!
",1217005,Zoidberg," Using this magneto, I will now guide the keys up the thorax and out via the frontal face hole. That's the storage locker, the boat, the other boat, pay dirt!
",15917006,Rich Little," Greetings, sports fans. Though whether this outpouring of inbreds can in fact be classified as a sport is a subject of no small scholarly debate.
",14717007,Sal," Well, wells, well, if it ain'ts Princess Pukerella and her pukey puke-mobile.
",7917008,Leela," Oh, yeah? Well... Shut up.
",2817009,Bender," -Good comeback, Leela.
",2417010,Leela," You shut up, too.
",1917011,Rich Little," Rich Little, here, as Howard Cosell. And now to grace us with its rendition of the national anthem, please welcome what is left of the Dixie Chicks after their tragic matter transporter accident.
",19717012,The Dixie Chicks," We're in horrible pain.
",2517013,Rich Little," And we are underway.
",2217014,Sal," Whoas!
",817015,Leela," Yes! Now we're inflicting.
",2817016,Rich Little," Outstanding! Tonight we are witnessing a veritable clinic and that ludicrous hullabaloo known as demolition derby.
",11617017,George George Takei,"  Way to kill the franchise, Bakula. 
Rich Little : Ladies and gentlemen, we are down to our final two ships. In the storied annals of demolition derby, today will surely be remembered, if only as the day upon which I was absorbed  into that hideous conglomeration once known as the Dixie Chicks.
",29717018,Leela," Buckle your sphincters.
",2517019,Sal," That broad's insanes.
",2317020,Hoschel," But you're insansier, right?
",3017021,Sal," Nah, I guess nots. I've decideds to relax and enjoy life from now ons.
",7217022,Rich Little," Planet Express takes the trophy.
",3417023,Leela," Now, I'll use the magnet to get the keys back in there.
",5717024,Zoidberg," What? You mean I cut a big hole in him for nothing? 
Leela: Don't worry, the Professor won't even remember that he has a spaceship. 
Farnsworth: Ah, my precious spaceship! Come, friends. Let's take her for a spin to the malt shop like old times.
",24717025,Leela," Leela to Zoidberg. Execute Distraction Protocol Alpha.
",5617026,Zoidberg," Roger that.
",1317027,Zoidberg," Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Ooh!  Don't look at me.
",7317028,Farnsworth," Yes, she's a wonderful ship, all right. As beautiful now as the day I got botched laser eye surgery.  Now, that's odd. What's the fuel gauge doing on the fl...  Great Godzilla's gonads! Who wasted precious fuel? Answer now or be punished.
",24017029,Leela," All right, fine. I admit it.
",3017030,Farnsworth," You will be punished.
",2317031,Chinese Boy," Oh, my gosh, 20!
",1817032,Dwight," Your pole arm does double damage, and the gelatinous cube dies in horrible poverty. 
Cubert: I proceed to cast a spell of darkness.
",13317033,Indian Boy," Most ingenious.
",1717034,Chinese Boy," Ah, Bender?
",1317035,Bender," Me? I, uh cast a spell of darkness.  Pretty imaginative, huh?
",6317036,Cubert," No, you just did the same thing as me, but with a dumb noise.
",6317037,Bender," Oh... You're right. I'm great in every way except I have no imagination. All I ever wanted is to play this magical game and I can't.
",13417038,Dwight," Yes, you can. You just have to lose yourself in the fantasy. You have to believe the impossible is merely preposterous.
",12117039,Bender," Okay. Here goes. Visor down. I believe, I believe.  I did it! I imagined something. For 1.3 milliseconds, I truly believed I was a noble robot in days of yonder.
",16317040,Chinese Boy," Way to go, Bender.
",2017041,Cubert," What is thy character's name, good sir?
",4117042,Bender," Uh, um... I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
",6017043,Farnsworth," Everybody out of the conference room. I am calling a conference.  Everybody get in here.  You wasted precious fuel just because you were insulted by some redneck yokel from beyond the stars?
",19217044,Leela," It was only half a ball.
",2617045,Farnsworth," That's not the point. Your temper is out of control. And to think I'd have never even known if it weren't for the lengthy and unsolicited tattling of Dr. Zoidberg.
",16517046,Zoidberg," She also took home two rolls of Scotch tape.
",4617047,Farnsworth," Thank you, Dr. Zoidberg. Hermes, incentivize that employee. As for you, Leela, I'm letting you off with a warning.
",11617048,Leela," Oh, thank you.
",1617049,Farnsworth," A warning that will be administered by this 50,000-volt shock collar.
",7117050,Leela," Zoidberg, I'm gonna put my boot so far up your cloaca, you'll be...  Ow!
",7417051,Farnsworth," The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence. 
Leela: Ouch!
",8517052,Farnsworth," Profanity.
",1217053,Leela," Son of a...  Ow!
",1817054,Farnsworth," Or perversions of a sexual nature.
",3617055,Leela,"  Ow!
",617056,Hermes," It's the only collar they had in stock at Office Depot.
",5717057,Zoidberg," I hope you picked up some Scotch tape while you were there.
",6117058,Bender," That's a good one.
",2017059,Narrator," Imagine, if you will, an announcer you can barely understand. He refers to a... *incoherent mumbling* But you're not quite sure what he said. He seems to be eating something, or perhaps he's a little drunk. It's remotely possible that he just said something about... The Scary Door.
",28417060,Soldier #1," Firing, sir!
",1417061,Soldier #1," It's all over. Our guns and bombs are useless against the aliens.
",6717062,Farmer," The saucers! Theys'a crashin'!
",3217063,Narrator," In the end, it was not guns or bombs that defeated the aliens, but that humblest of all God's creatures, the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
",12917064,Leela," I can't believe TiVo suggested that piece of...  Ow! Come on, Hermes. Surely you have the authority to remove this damn  collar.
",13017065,Hermes," Alas, no. I got the key but not the authority.
",4817066,Leela,"  Yeow! Well, who does have the authority?
",4317067,Hermes," Only the staff doctor. You'll have to convince him that you have resolved your anger issues.
",9417068,Leela," I don't have any god da-  mother f-  anger issues. 
Dwight: As your dwarf-skin canoe rounds a bend you suddenly see...  A terrifying red dragon.
",14617069,Indian Boy," What do we do? What do we do?
",3117070,Bender," Wait, I know. I make use of my rod of fireballs. 
",5117071,Cubert,"  Everyone knows red dragons are immune to fireballs as well as all other forms of incendiary attack.
",10217072,Bender," Yes, but I aim not at the dragon but at the river itself to create a shroud of steam through which we can escape.
",11517073,All," Whoa!
",717074,Dwight,"  Sweet pony of Sierra Leone, it worked!
",4117075,Chinese Boy," We did it!
",1217076,Cubert," Success!
",1017077,Fry," Bender, smell this milk.
",2617078,Bender," I go not by the name of Bender, you fleshy fool. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
",9917079,Fry," Professor, something's bothering me.
",3817080,Monkey," Well, you can always talk to me about anything, Fry. What's on your mind?
",7517081,Fry," Well, it's... it's about my friend Bender.
",4417082,Farnsworth Monkey," Mmm. I see. Show me on this anatomically correct doll exactly where he touched you.
",8517083,Fry," No, it's nothing like that. It's just that I am worried about him. He's being playing an awful lot of Dungeons & Dragons.
",12317084,Farnsworth Monkey," Dungeons &... Good God! Hasn't he seen the Afterschool Special? You've got to talk to him, Fry. Make him quit now before he completely loses his mind.
",15217085,Fry," Okay, I will.
",1517086,Farnsworth Monkey," Good boy. Just don't let him touch you down there.
",5217087,Zoidberg," Well, here's your problem, right here. You've got a skull embedded in your head.
",8217088,Leela,"  You're absolutely right, Doctor. Can the collar come off now?
",6417089,Zoidberg," Let me just peel your head a little and see if I can get that skull out. 
Zoidberg: So, you tell me, little miss expert, why always with the temper? Calm down for once and think. Here, enjoy a relaxing spritz from my empathy bladder. 
Zoidberg: What is it, already? What's the cause of your anger?
",29917090,Leela," I guess I would have to say, I hate you. 
Zoidberg: I'm beginning to understand. It all goes back to your parents.
",11617091,Leela," What? 
Zoidberg: They pushed you to study medicine when all you ever wanted was to be a song-and-dance man.  Why? Whyyy?
",12217092,Leela," I was raised in an orphanarium. My parents are sewer mutants who I never even met until a few years ago.
",10617093,Zoidberg," Then you've got to go to them and work this song-and-dance stuff out. Maybe have them cook me nice dinner. No scallions. I hate them.  Amy, cancel my appointments.
",16517094,Amy," Stop calling me.
",1817095,Fry," Bender, please don't get mad, but I think you might be playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
",9317096,Bender," You're absolutely right, Fry. I almost went insane, but after this heart-to-heart talk, I've decided to quit.
",11117097,Fry," Really? Whew! That's a load off my toad.
",4217098,Bender," Now, if you'll excuse me.  I'm off to slay the werewolf of Goblin Mountain. 
Bender: On guard, man-wench! Prepare to cross blades.
",13217099,Hermaphrobot," You couldn't afford it, honey. 
Bender: Foolish leprechaun, I scoop your treasure in the name of the fancy men. 
",11417100,Hermes," He also left a small pile of treasure on the living room rug.
",6317101,Bender," Foul dragon, meet thy doom.
",2917102,Turanga Munda," Would you like a napkin, Doctor?
",3417103,Zoidberg," Thank you.
",1217104,Leela," Satisfied, Zoidberg? My relationship with my parents is fine.
",6317105,Turanga Munda," Now, hold on, Leela. Maybe this torture collar is good for you.
",6517106,Leela," What?  Ow!
",1217107,Turanga Munda," It'll control your temper. Men like a woman who's not always slamming their head in the car door.
",9917108,Turanga Morris," She's right. That's what first attracted me to your mother. 
Turanga Munda: So, Leela, I understand your friend here is a physician, and I'm not seeing a ring on his claw.
",17317109,Leela," Mom, he's a cockroach from outer space. 
Zoidberg: Good, Leela, work that anger out. Excuse me a moment, I'm swarming with parasites. 
Turanga Morris: Hey, it's what's-his-name from the surface. The bi-clops.
",21017110,Fry," Ha-have you seen Bender? He's gone nuts. Also, smell this milk.
",6517111,Bender," Prepare for a surprise attack.
",3217112,Zoidberg," Someone do something.
",2317113,Leela," I would, but...  Ow! Take my collar off.
",4217114,Zoidberg," I can't, I'm still eating.  Help me, Leela.
",4517115,Bender," I cast upon thee a spell of fireball! 
Zoidberg: No. Not the spork.
",6917116,Fry,"  Beholdeth, Titanius, I cast a freeze ray upon you.
",5317117,Bender,"  That's ridiculous. There's no such thing as a ""freeze ray."" What, you mean a cone of coldness?
",9717118,Fry," Yeah, that.
",1317119,Bender," No! No! Fancy men are defenseless against cone of coldness.  I'm freezing... what? Ah! 
Fry: Bender, no. When will young people learn that Dungeons & Dragons won't make you cool?
",18017120,Zoidberg," Relax, Fry. I'm a doctor. I'm sure the robut will be just fine with a little help.
",8417121,Bender," Help, help.   Help! 
",2217122,Roberto," Previously, on Futurama. Hah-haa! 
",3617123,Dwight," A terrifying red dragon!
",2617124,Bender," I make use of my rod of fireballs. 
",3717125,Farnsworth," The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence. 
",7217126,Leela," Ouch!
",717127,Fry," Bender, I think you might be  playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
",6817128,Bender," You're absolutely right, Fry.  Now, if you'll excuse me.  I'm off to slay the werewolf of Goblin Mountain. 
",10917129,Dr. Perceptron," Please, send in the patient.
",3017130,Intercom Assistant," Yes, Doctor. 
",1517131,Bender," Wee!
",617132,Dr. Perceptron," So,  Bender, I understand you're having trouble separating fantasy from reality.
",8217133,Bender," Says who? Was it the bugbear? Is he talking about me again?
",6117134,Dr. Perceptron," I understand. Commence therapy. 
",3417135,Fry," Poor Bender. Says here to tell his friends he's at a spa.
",5917136,Amy," So what happened to Bender?
",2917137,Fry," He's at a spa.
",1617138,Amy," Wow, there's a spa in the nut house?
",3817139,Zoidberg," Friends, friends, stop everything. There's food in this shaker. 
",6617140,Leela," Ow! Can you please remove this anger collar?
",4617141,Hermes," Are you still angry?
",2217142,Leela," No.  Ow!
",1017143,Hermes," It also shocks you when you lie.
",3417144,Farnsworth," Quiet, everyone. The network news is on and if I, a 165-year-old man, don't watch it, who will?
",9717145,Morbo," Thankfully, the amazing talking horse was rescued and safely returned to the meat department.
",9517146,Linda,"  Turning to the less stupid portion of our broadcast, fuel prices hit an all-time high today due to the ongoing dark matter shortage.
",13517147,Morbo," Earlier, our own Morbo sat down with Mom, CEO of Mom's Friendly Multinational Energy Conglomerate.
",10017148,Morbo,"  Morbo the Annihilator, here, sitting down to a delightful tea in this fake living room set.  Thank you for joining us, Mom.
",12617149,Mom," My pleasure, sugarplum.
",2517150,Morbo," Mom, you control the world's only dark matter mine. Why are fuel prices so high?
",8217151,Mom," Oh! It's terrible, isn't it? Dark matter is just so rare nowadays, but we'll keep pinching loaf after loaf from the bowels of the earth, even if I lose money on every log.
",17317152,Morbo," If you are losing money, how did you post record profits last quarter?
",7217153,Mom," You look thin, care for one of my famous pecan clusters?
",5817154,Morbo,"  Morbo shouldn't. It will go straight to Morbo's gargantuan forehead. Oh, what the heck? I guess I could destroy one or two of them. 
",13517155,Mom," Do people care enough to drill for dark matter even in an Alaskan wildlife refuge? People do.
",9517156,Farnsworth," Greedy old hag, taste the wrath of my fuzzy slipper. 
",5517157,Leela," Professor, why are you so hot and dusty over this dark matter shortage?
",7317158,Farnsworth," Oohh... I bet you'd like to know. I bet you'd like to know, indeed.
",6917159,Walt," Hello, Mother. How did the interview go?
",4217160,Mom," It made me want to puke my face off. Where's my Thigh Blaster?
",6417161,Larry," Right here, Mom.
",1817162,Mom," Shut up!
",1017163,Larry," Okay, thank you.
",1817164,Mom," Burn, you damn thighs. Burn!
",3017165,Igner," Mommy, are you upset 'cause of the dark matter shortage?
",5817166,Mom," There is no shortage, you moronic ass-brain!
",4617167,Inger," There's not? But you said...
",3017168,Mom,"  Allow me to explain. Suppose this hand represents current reserves of dark matter and this hand represents consumer demand.
",12617169,Igner," Uh-huh.
",917170,Farnsworth," I just bet you'd like to know why I'm so angry about this dark matter shortage. I bet very much you'd like to know.
",11717171,Amy," You're right, Professor. We would like to know.
",4917172,Farnsworth," Really? I didn't think anyone was interested. It all started 30-odd years ago.  I was working in Mom's laboratories for the third time after twice before realizing how evil she was and vowing never to work for her again. But somehow the rich, wrong stench of her boney charms kept calling me back.
",29917173,Zoidberg," Don't stop, Professor. I'm getting aroused. 
",4617174,Farnsworth," Back in those days, dark matter was just a worthless inert curiosity, and I was smashing it in a particle accelerator, in an ill-conceived attempt to create a more durable harpsichord wax. But, as Deepak Chopra taught us, quantum physics means anything can happen at any time for no reason. Also, eat plenty of oatmeal and animals never had a war. Who's the real animals?  And thus against all probabilities... it happened. [The dark matter particles in the particle accelerator begin colliding and exploding. A large explosion leaves only a single item - the single non-local metaparticle crystal.
",60017175,Younger Farnsworth," Dang!
",717176,Farnsworth," I'm sure I don't need to explain that all dark matter in the universe is linked in the form of a single non-local meta-particle.
",13017177,Amy," Guhh! Stop patronizing us.
",2817178,Farnsworth," So, in one instant, I had transformed all dark matter everywhere into a new crystalline form...  ...making it the most potent fuel since primitive man first ignited mastodon flatulence to heat his cave.
",20417179,Younger Mom," I'm intrigued, Hubert. You have my undivided attention.
",5717180,Younger Mom," Shut up, you milk-sucking leeches! A new super fuel, eh? We're rich.
",7017181,Younger Farnsworth," Indeed, we are.
",1717182,Younger Mom," Not you, we. Us, we.  I'm getting back together with my ex-husband.
",6917183,Younger Farnsworth," Wernstrom!
",1217184,Younger Wernstrom," You've been played, Farnsworth. Played like a cheap harpsichord.
",6617185,Younger Mom," Walt, fire that employee like Mommy taught you.
",4917186,Leela," Professor, maybe I can help you get even with Mom. I spend most of my time thinking about how to get revenge on a bad boss.
",12517187,Fry," Me, too.
",1017188,Zoidberg," Ditto!
",817189,Hermes," Likewise.
",1117190,Amy," I made a blinding powder.
",2717191,Farnsworth," Thanks, but that won't be necessary because I have the ultimate weapon.  You see, in the instant the energy crystal was created, there also came into being an opposite crystal made of pure anti-backwards energy.
",21317192,All," Wow!
",617193,Hermes," So?
",517194,Farnsworth," So, this! If ever the two crystals should meet, their wave functions would collapse like Raymond Burr's trampoline, once again rendering all dark matter inert and useless as fuel.
",18117195,Hermes," But then we'll have no fuel.
",3017196,Farnsworth," But once we free society from dependence on Mom's dark matter, scientists will finally care enough to develop cleaner, alternative fuels.
",13917197,Fry," Scientists like you!
",2217198,Farnsworth," No, not me. I'm too busy developing makeup for dogs. That's where the money is.
",8117199,Leela,"  This is our chance to teach Mom a lesson. Let's take the anti-crystal and shove it up Mom's regular crystal.
",11117200,All," Yeah.
",717201,Hermes," Fight the power!
",1817202,Farnsworth," There's just one, small problem, and it's a big one. I hid the crystal and I can't remember where.
",10017203,Hermes," Surely it's just a matter of waiting till you next move your bowels and then using a potato masher...
",10317204,Farnsworth," Don't you think I already tried that? No. I'm afraid, the crystal is lost forever.
",8417205,Dwight," Nine? You did it. You outwitted the fungus.
",4517206,All," Woohoo!
",917207,Chinese Boy," Who needs girls?
",1817208,Dr. Perceptron," Since you have all proven resistant to individualized hammer therapy, I now prescribe group therapy.
",10217209,Rosie," Everything must be clean, very clean. That's why the dog had to die. He was a dirty dog. Dirty, dirty. Also, that boy, Elroy. Dirty, dirty.
",14117210,Dr. Perceptron," Who would like to share their feelings?
",4117211,Intercom Assistant," I feel unappreciated at work.
",3117212,Dr. Perceptron," What? I can barely understand you.
",3617213,Intercom Assistant," I said I feel...
",1817214,Mad Hatterbot," Change places.
",1617215,Roberto," Well, well. Looks like old Roberto is the focus of attention now. Stop looking at me. 
",8817216,Dr. Perceptron," Calm down, Roberto. Tell us about your childhood.
",5117217,Roberto," I was designed by a team of engineers attempting to build an insane robot. But it seems they failed.
",10217218,Convenience Store Bot," Um, actually... 
",1817219,Bender," Look, we have to accept the fact that we all have a serious problem.
",7017220,Roberto," Amen.
",717221,Dr. Perceptron," Good, Bender.
",1517222,Rosie," That's right.
",1517223,Bender," There's a band of river trolls living in the moat and they may have no intention of letting us out of this castle, unless we hand over the Golden Scepter of Zanthor.
",16717224,Roberto," Say what? Dude's crazy.
",2517225,Dr. Perceptron," Bender, please, try to...
",2717226,Bender," I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
",7717227,Dr. Perceptron," You are suffering a breakdown.  I'm in your seat. I forgot we had changed places.
",8317228,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone!
",2217229,Amy," You perfected dog mascara?
",2817230,Farnsworth," Far from it. If you ask me, they look like a bunch of hookers. But what I have invented is a means of locating the missing crystal.  When I push this button, the crystal will emit a high-frequency stink.
",20517231,Zoidberg,"  Hurray!
",1017232,Farnsworth," There. Now, with any luck I'll detect it with my smelling aid.  I just pray to all powerful Atheismo that we find it before Mom does.
",13517233,Hermes," Do you smell the crystal, Professor?
",3817234,Farnsworth," No, damn it! Just the alluring scent of Obsession for spaniels.
",6517235,Dwight," Dude. Who whipped an egger?
",2917236,Dwight," Well, he who denied it, supplied it.
",3817237,Cubert," Well, he who articulated it, particulated it.
",4717238,Dwight," Well, he who refuted it, tooted it.
",3717239,Cubert," Stalemate.
",1217240,Mom," Jesus craps. The anti-backwards crystal.
",4217241,Larry," Ow! Ah... sorry?
",1817242,Mom," Relax, it's not your fault.  I can't believe it still exists. Google the hell out of that skanker.  Planet-sucking-Express? Of course. How could I have been so dumb?  With that crystal, Farnsworth could completely destroy my dark matter empire. I underestimated that sagging old bag of bones and gonads.
",30517243,Inger," Is that man bad?
",1817244,Mom," Very bad, Igner. And that's why I need you three to go steal the anti-crystal away from him. But be careful. You'll need all your stoogely cunning.
",14917245,Walt," Exterminators.
",1617246,Fry," Oh, great. What do we got? Wall gophers? Toilet snails?
",5717247,Walt," No, I'm afraid you've got owls. Over there, see?
",5017248,Igner," Ow!
",517249,Walt," Dump the bag, you nitwit.
",2717250,Larry," Hey, watch it. 
",1717251,Walt," Quiet, you.  Ow!
",1817252,Fry," I was looking over there for a long time but I didn't see any... Oh, there they are. Gross.
",9317253,Walt," We've got to act fast. Larry, get out the geigersniffer.
",5817254,Larry," You're just gonna hit me with it.
",3517255,Walt," No. I'm going to hit you with this. 
",3817256,Fry," Those three exterminators are hilarious.
",4217257,Amy," Really? I don't think so.
",2717258,Leela," Me, neither. Now, Sex and the City, that's funny.
",5117259,Dwight," After wandering aimlessly in the swamp, you suddenly...  wander aimlessly in the swamp.
",8917260,Walt," There it is. 
",1517261,Cubert," Uh, excuse you.
",1717262,Walt," I'm sorry, little boy. You see, we're owl exterminators.
",5817263,Igner," We are owl extermin...  Ow!
",2917264,Walt," And what we have here is an owl egg that's about to hatch into an owl larva. So, if you don't mind, we'll just take this and...
",12917265,Cubert,"  What are you, stupid? That's a dodecahedral crystal I found hidden in the downstairs walrus tank.
",10017266,Dwight," And I wrote numbers on it so we could use it as a D12, 'cause I have the best handwriting.
",9217267,Cubert," Do not.
",917268,Dwight," Do too.
",917269,Cubert," Do not.
",917270,Dwight," Do too.
",917271,Cubert," You win this round.
",2117272,Farnsworth," What's going on here?
",2317273,Igner," We're owl exterminators.
",2617274,Farnsworth," Oh? Then you won't have any problem exterminating this owl.
",6117275,Farnsworth," My anti-backwards crystal. So it's you three. I should have known Mom would send her brainless brood to do her dirty work. Walt, the leader among imbeciles.
",15817276,Walt," Hey! They resent that.
",2417277,Farnsworth," Larry, the snivelling middle child.
",3717278,Larry," Sorry. Thank you.
",1917279,Farnsworth," And you, Igner. The evil I could tolerate, but the stupidity... 
Igner: We're owl exterminators.
",9817280,Farnsworth," Good God. Just knowing we're in the same genus makes me embarrassed to call myself homo.  Now, get out and tell Mom thanks for the crystal. 
",14217281,Igner," Thanks for the crystal.
",2517282,Fry," There. The repairs are complete.
",3417283,Farnsworth,"  Let's go, already. We've got to infiltrate Mom's dark matter mine, now. How do you start this thing?  Good Lord, woman. Can you move any slower?  Rake up some dark matter and top off the tank.
",19517284,Leela," Well, there isn't any dark matter. Nibbler hasn't pooped at all. And he ate a whole family of koalas last night. Nibbler! Nibbler!
",13217285,Farnsworth," I'm not interested in the whereabouts of your cutesy-fruitsy space rat. The only thing that matters right now is this crystal. 
",12917286,Leela," Ow!
",517287,Farnsworth," And be careful with that crystal. 
Bender:   Death to ogres! 
",6317288,Dr. Perceptron," Even relaxation therapy has failed. Nurse, schedule a robotomy for Bender.
",7617289,Nurse Ratchet," Yes, Doctor. I'll get the tools from the shed.
",4817290,Dr. Perceptron," It's a very painful procedure. So until then, just try to relax.
",6617291,Mom," What are you laughing at?
",2717292,Larry," Your laugh. It's just so infectious.
",3817293,Mom," So's herpes. Now, shut up! You and Walt, lead the killbots to the surface and blow Farnsworth out of the sky.
",11117294,Walt," What about Igner?
",1917295,Mom," That hairless ape? I swear. When he came out I flipped a coin whether to keep him or the after-birth.
",10317296,Walt," Yes, Mother. You told that story at his graduation.
",5317297,Mom," I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission. You see, there is a terrible secret about Igner I've never told anyone. And here it is.
",13717298,Walt," Continue returning fire.
",2617299,Killbot #1 1,"  What?
",817300,Killbot #1 2,"  What did they say?
",2117301,Killbot #1 1," I don't know. I can't hear a thing.
",3717302,Killbot #1 3,"  Hey, what's everybody talking about?
",3917303,Farnsworth," Mayday! Mayday!  Oh, God. I cannot believe this is the best plan I could come up with.  We weren't actually in the ship.
",12217304,Leela," Okay, team, these red-hot, razor-sharp fans are the only safe way into the mine.
",8217305,Fry," Hmm, uh, ladies first.  Phew! That blade missed me by the skin of my pants. 
",7817306,Elevator Steward," Maintenance shaft 7 serving...
",3217307,Farnsworth," Shut your mouth.
",1817308,Elevator Steward," I'm just talking about the shaft.
",3517309,Fry," Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?
",3917310,Leela," Actually, feels kind of good. I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up.
",10817311,Walt," We shot them down, Mother. The intruders never even got to Sector 1.
",7017312,Security Woman #1," Intruders in Sector 15. Intruders in Sector 15.
",4917313,Mom," Ugh... Sometimes I don't know why I even bother to slap you.   All Killbots to Sector 15.
",9117314,Killbot #1 1,"  What did she say?
",2017315,Killbot #1 2," What did you say? 
",2017316,Fry," There are so many killbots behind us I can't count them all. Three, I think.
",7817317,Leela," We're trapped.
",1617318,Farnsworth," The main pit must be in here. I'm detecting vast quantities of Dark Matter.
",7717319,Leela," Step aside turkey-neck. I think I know the code. 
",5117320,Farnsworth," We're in. We're in the heart of the mine. The very source of all Mom's wealth and... 
",8717321,Leela," My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm.
",5117322,Fry," Is there really so much of a distinction? I mean...
",5317323,Nibbler,"  Leela, it's me, Nibbler.
",2717324,Leela," Oh, my God, you look horrible, Nibbler. I think I'm going to vomit.
",6917325,Nibblonian," Nibbler is over there.
",2417326,Leela," Oh, sorry. Nibbler!
",2117327,Morbo," Previously, on puny Futurama. Mwaah! 
",3917328,Bender," Foolish leprechaun, I scoop your treasure in the name of the fancy men. 
",7417329,Fry," Bender, I think you might be  playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
",6817330,Bender," I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
",7717331,Dr. Perceptron," Please, send in the patient.
",3017332,Bender," Wee!
",617333,Farnsworth," The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence. 
",7217334,Leela," Ouch!
",717335,Fry," Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?
",3917336,Leela," Actually, I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up.
",8817337,Morbo," Mom, you control the world's only dark matter mine.
",5317338,Leela," My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm. 
",5217339,Leela," Oh, my poor little snuzzy-wuzzams. Are they treating you okay?
",6417340,Nibbler," No, they are force-feeding us so we poop more dark matter. It's horrible.  Those are good. You've got to help us.
",11517341,Nibblonians," Help us!
",1017342,Nibblonian," Help us, for God's sakes!
",2717343,Leela," Nibbler made a bo-bo.
",2317344,Nibbler," But not on my terms. I will not be treated like... Hey, wait, aren't you amazed I can speak?
",9417345,Fry," Well, actually, no. You forgot to blank our memories after you spoke last time.
",8117346,Nibbler," Then why did you let me eat Friskies and make bo-bo in a litter box?
",7017347,Fry," Well, you're cuter that way.
",3017348,Farnsworth," Cute as a baby's buttocks.
",2817349,Leela," So what happened? How did Mom capture all you Nibblonians?
",6017350,Nibbler,"  It all began 36 years ago...  Now! On the planet Vergon 6.   It was a veritable Eden, brimming with unique and irreplaceable species.  Most of which were delicious.  I was Supreme Fuzzler of a Nibblonian scientific outpost. It was paradise, until they came. One of your DOOP ships struck dark matter, little realizing it was not a natural deposit, but rather centuries of Nibblonian fecal material.
",40117351,Fry," The big faecal enchilada. Anyone else hungry?
",4717352,Nibbler," The DOOP contracted a ruthless businesswoman to spearhead the mining operation.
",8117353,Leela," Let me guess. Mom?
",2017354,Nibbler," The very same.
",1617355,Fry," Can I also guess Mom?
",2317356,Nibbler," To reduce cost she started a new enterprise, Mom's Friendly Robots, to build robot slaves. Remember this was back in the days before Robot Lincoln.
",14917357,Mom," Faster, faster!
",1717358,Robot #1 Slave," I'm going exactly as fast as you built me to go.
",5017359,Mom," Oh, wise guy, huh?
",2017360,Robot #1 Slave," Ow!
",517361,Nibbler," Eventually, the planet was mined down to a hollow shell and my people were forced to evacuate.  Alas, I had eaten a day-old Swinosaur for lunch. And while doing some evacuating of my own, I was left behind. [He makes noises that often accompany bowel movements. Mom is watching him Mom: So, that's where it comes from. We may have a whole new source of Dark Matter on our hands.
",38017362,Igner," Eww!
",617363,Nibbler," As it turned out I was the lucky one.  Unbeknownst to me, Mom captured my colleagues and enslaved them here in this... this... crap farm.
",13917364,Nibblonian," There's nothing to do but eat and crap, eat and crap. It's like visiting my parents.
",8617365,Nibbler," As for me, I emerged from behind the ""bush of many uses"" to find I had been left behind. I was doomed, doomed.
",11217366,Leela," Hello, there.
",1517367,Nibbler," Startled, my cuteness reflex kicked in.
",4117368,Leela," I'll call him Nibbler.
",2417369,Nibbler," A silly name for a high-ranking Fuzzler. But, hey, I was glad to be rescued. 
Leela: But then, how did you end up here with the others?
",13717370,Nibbler," I was kidnapped yesterday by Mom's vile sons in their moronic disguises.
",7417371,Igner," I was an owl exterminator.  Do you have the crysal?
",5317372,Farnsworth," It's pronounced ""crystal,"" you lump.
",3817373,Igner," Go, run fast. 
Walt: Did you see anyone?
",4217374,Igner," Me?
",517375,Walt," Yes, you. You're the only one here.
",3717376,Igner," If I'm the only one here, then how could I see anyone?
",5617377,Larry," He's got a point, Walt.
",2517378,Walt," So does my knee.
",1817379,Fry," This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the chickens.
",5717380,Nurse Ratchet," Don't worry, those clamps are for my own protection.
",5417381,Dr. Perceptron," Do you know where you are, Bender?
",3617382,Bender," Sure do, I'm in the magical land of Cornwood, frolicking with wenches.
",7217383,Dr. Perceptron," Close. You're in the loony bin for a robotomy. 
Nurse Ratchet: Can't you just use the access panel?
",10117384,Dr. Perceptron," Either way is fine.
",2117385,Bender,"  Does anyone else smell burning dragon beak?
",4617386,Mom," Wherever you are, Farnsworth, my boys will find you. 
Walt: They've eluded us, Mother. But rest assured, we've already slapped each other, so there's no need to... 
Mom: You'll thank me some day when you are slapping your own kids.  I know Farnsworth's game. He is going to try to poke his clammy old crystal at my hot fiery crystal.
",33517387,Larry," Mom!
",617388,Mom," If the crystals get within six inches of each other...  Wham! All my dark matter will be worthless.
",10117389,Mom," Get them!
",1117390,Leela,"  Ooh. That feels good.
",2417391,Mom," Oh, for crying out...  Oh, the freaking battery's dead. Walt, where's the charger?
",8417392,Walt," In the hardware drawer, Mother. 
Mom: Damn tangled mess of wires.
",6717393,Farnsworth," We're almost there. The crystals are beginning to engorge.  I can't quite reach. Fry, grab onto my easy-fit waistband. Just a few more inches. Come on, really wedgie it on in there.  So, that's why they call me the Catman. 
Mom: Nobody move. I've found the charger.  Hang on. I'm on it. Okay, there!
",30117394,Fry," Save us, Catman.
",1817395,Mom," It's over, Hubert. Give me the anti-backwards crystal.
",5617396,Farnsworth," Never! 
Mom: Oh, bravo. You're in a crap-harvesting factory, genius. Walt! Larry! Start harvesting. 
",10217397,Farnsworth," No! 
Dr. Perceptron: I will now delicately jerk out your imagination, severing fantasy's grip on your nerd-circuit.
",11717398,Bender," Cornwood! 
Dr. Perceptron: Illogical. Illogical.
",5017399,Nurse Ratchet," But, Doctor, I love you. 
Mom: Oh, what now?
",4617400,Frydo," This is crazy. Ow! What the... You okay, Leela?
",4917401,Leegola," I think so.
",1317402,Frydo," Wait a second. Is there something different about your hooves? 
Leegola: Oh, Lord. I'm half-horse and half-naked.
",11517403,Frydo," Where the hell are we, hell?
",3017404,Frydo," Bender?
",917405,Titanius Anglesmith," I know not of this Bender. I'm Titanius Anglesmith. Welcome to Cornwood!
",7417406,Titanius Anglesmith," Wretched peasants, put aside your cares and feast on the succulent flesh of the roast munchkin!
",9717407,Peasent Cook," Care for a slice of scroto?
",2917408,Frydo," Uh... that's his name, right?
",3117409,Peasent Cook," 'Tis also that, sir.
",2217410,Titanius Anglesmith," We're honored this eve by a visit from my friends of old, Frydo and Leegola. So let the dwarves do their gay dance and let the gnomes play their sissy piccolos.  Dance! Dance, you little freaks. Faster.  Faster! 
Dwarf: My ankle!
",23117411,Titanius Anglesmith," To the kitchen with him!
",2617412,Dwarf," Wait! Wait! Wait! I do impressions. Behold! The swamp hag: ""Get out of my swamp, you kids!""
",9317413,Titanius Anglesmith," Don't let him get too crispy.
",3117414,Calculon," Lord Anglesmith.
",1817415,Titanius Anglesmith," You have ridden hard, noble squire. May I offer you a horn of ale and a shank of dwarf?
",8917416,Calculon," 'Tis dire news, sire. Dark riders approach.
",4517417,Titanius Anglesmith,"  You shall be handsomely rewarded, sir knight. We ride at once!  Oops!  Frydo! Saddle up that trusty steed.
",10917418,Frydo," What's happening? And why am I enjoying it so much?
",5317419,Titanius Anglesmith," Foul beast-bags! Meet thy doom!
",3317420,Waltazar," Follow me.
",1217421,Waltazar," Damn thee, Ignus.
",1917422,Larius," Well, you said to follow you.
",3117423,Waltazar," Well, now I say follow this! 
Larius: The Die of Power! He's rolling it.
",7417424,Waltazar," Oh, no!
",917425,Titanius Anglesmith," I'm back bab-... 
Die of Power: Seven. 
Titanius Anglesmith: ""Banish foes""? Cool.
",8317426,Waltazar," No! No!
",917427,Larius," I got to say, I had no idea the Die of Power was so powerful.
",6317428,Waltazar," Did you have any idea of... 
Swamp Hag: Get out of my swamp, you kids!
",7217429,Leegola," I can't believe I'm saying this, but that was really exciting. I've never felt so alive.  What else can we slay? Is that a hobbit over there?
",14317430,Titanius Anglesmith," No, that's a hobo and a rabbit. But they're making a hobbit.
",6217431,Frydo," Thank God, an outhouse.
",2517432,Titanius Anglesmith," Hush! This be no outhouse, but the lair of the great wizard Grayfarn.
",7117433,Greyfarn," Who is it? 
Titanius Anglesmith: 'Tis I, Titanius.
",5217434,Greyfarn," Just a moment. 
Titanius Anglesmith:  Methinks the wizard be casting a powerful spell, indeed.
",9617435,Greyfarn," Come in! Come in! Yes. 'Tis a powerful object in both our worlds. If you failed to destroy it in yours, perhaps you were brought here that you might have a second chance.
",17217436,Frydo," So, this land is real?
",2417437,Greyfarn," Oh, dreadfully real. If you die here, you'll really be dead. But instead of science, we believe in crazy hocus-pocus. It's like Kansas.
",13717438,Leegola," God help us.
",1417439,Greyfarn," Cornwood's troubles began hundreds or perhaps millions of years ago.  Deep in the Geysers of Gygax, Momon herself injection-molded the Dice of Power from the living plastic.
",17517440,Momon,"  Damn, these are hot.
",2317441,Leegola," Ah ha! In our universe she's called Mom.
",4217442,Greyfarn," In your universe, are you taught not to interrupt? Evidently not. Anyway, Momon spawned three rotten sons, whom you've already had the displeasure of meeting. Waltazar, Larius, and the dumbest of all, the halfwit Ignus, bastard son of Momon and the brainless He-demon. Curse you, Momon, queen of all that is evil and not very good in bed. And I'm not just saying that because she dumped me.   Yes, I was once her consort. I was blinded by love, and later, scorpion venom.  I'm blind!  But Momon has one weakness. She put too much of her power into this. The generalissimo of dice. 
Titanius Anglesmith: Well, bite my shiny metal face. 
Greyfarn: Don't be foolish, Titanius. If you had paid attention in freshman alchemy, instead of frequenting the bawdyhouse, you'd know there's only one way to destroy it. In the boiling plastic from which it was molded.
",85717443,Frydo," Like that machine that makes wax lions at the zoo.
",5217444,Greyfarn," Quiet, you. We must infiltrate the Geysers of Gygax, the impenetrable stronghold of Momon.
",9217445,Titanius Anglesmith," Impossible. Impossible, I say.
",3217446,Greyfarn," No, Titanius. For we maintain one advantage, the element of surprise. 
Titanius Anglesmith: Verily, our quest has begun.
",12217447,Hermaphrodite," Stop right there.
",1917448,Frydo," Hermes?
",917449,Leegola," He's a centaur like me.
",2517450,Frydo," You wish.
",1117451,Hermaphrodite," I am Hermaphrodite, most beautiful of centaurs. Gaze upon me and weep at my loveliness.
",8917452,Greyfarn," Very well.
",1217453,Titanius Anglesmith," Loveliest of centaurs, we seek to end Momon's reign of evil. Have you stout fighters at your command?
",10317454,Hermaphrodite," One thousand archers of truest aim.  Fire!
",4417455,Titanius Anglesmith," Hey guys, I forgot I had this pumpkin. 
Leegola: I knew it. My people are mighty warriors. Our enemies will be like Swiss cheese with blood coming out of the holes.
",16617456,Female Centaur," We centaurs are creatures of peace.
",3717457,Leegola," Oh, Lord.
",1117458,Hermaphrodite," Violence is never justified. We shall not join your quest. And furthermore, if mayhem be your intent, you may not cross our lands.
",13217459,Leegola," Or what?
",1017460,Hermaphrodite,"  Or... Uh... Mmm?
",1917461,Greyfarn," We're not there, we're here.
",3017462,Titanius Anglesmith," No, this way.
",1517463,Greyfarn," I mean, here.
",1517464,Greyfarn," Thank you, kindly, Treedledum.
",3217465,Treedledum," Okey-doke. Anything else I can do?
",3617466,Leegola," You know who I'm gonna miss? That tree guy.
",4517467,Greyfarn," Bad news, fancy men. Momon's guards stand watch at the pass. 'Tis as if she somehow anticipated us.
",10117468,Titanius Anglesmith," And so our quest comes to an end. I only regret not giving up sooner.
",7117469,Greyfarn," Fret not, Titanius. For we still have one hope, the Cave of Hopelessness.
",7517470,Titanius Anglesmith," Let me know how that turns out.
",3317471,Ogre," Halt. Are you on the list? I'm not seeing you on the list.
",6017472,Leegola," I'll split this doofus in half.
",3317473,Titanius Anglesmith," Wait, I got it. Yeah. My cousin's in the band. The band of merry men. Please, we were already in there. I just need to go back for my coat.
",14117474,Gynecaladriel," I am Gynecaladriel, queen of the water nymphos.
",4917475,Leegola," All right. I'll split this doofus in half.
",4417476,Gynecaladriel," Stand aside and I will use my powers to overwhelm the guard.  Behold, the deed is done.
",8917477,Titanius Anglesmith," Hi oh!
",817478,Frydo," Mr. Wizard, why is this place called the Cave of Hopelessness?
",6417479,Greyfarn," Oh, fear not, lad. 'Tis named for its discoverer, Reginald Hopelessness...
",7617480,Frydo," Whew!
",717481,Greyfarn," ...the first man to be eaten alive by the Tunneling Horror.
",6117482,Frydo," What's that? The Tunneling Horror?
",3617483,Gynecaladriel," No, it's morcs.
",1717484,Morcs," Hey, listen. Nanu, nanu. Shazbot.
",3517485,Titanius Anglesmith," Oh, God, no. They're so aggravating.
",3817486,Morcs," Oh, fantastic. Nanu, nanu. Reality, what a concept. Fantastic.  Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
",8617487,Gynecaladriel," Shut up! Shut up!
",1917488,Morcs," Oh, fantastic. Oh, fantastic. Oh, wonderful.
",4617489,Frydo," Maybe it'll go away if we just don't laugh at it.
",5117490,Titanius Anglesmith," It doesn't.
",1317491,Morcs," Nanu, nanu.  Oh, shazbot. 
Frydo: Well, at least we didn't have to face the tunneling whatchimacallit.  Uh-oh.
",11217492,Zoidberg," Enough already with the banging and the swashbuckling.
",5617493,Leegola," Oh, I'm gonna enjoy killing you. 
Zoidberg: Watch where you're shooting that thing.  Again? What, am I talking to myself over here?
",13317494,Leegola," Mutilate! 
Zoidberg: Okay. Now, I'm getting a little mad even.
",6417495,Leegola," I'll kill you and eat your heart, you abomination. 
Zoidberg:  Don't make me laugh. The very idea that removing only one of my two hearts could... Hey, what are you doing down there?  Now, I'm dead. 
Frydo: Leela, it's over. You killed him enough.
",24917496,Leegola," I'm not taking any chances with the Tunneling Horror.
",5517497,Zoidberg," What? I'm not the Tunneling Horror. I hate that guy. Always with the tunneling. Anyway, I'm dead. 
Leegola: So, you're just an innocent monster. Oh, God. What have I done?
",17317498,Zoidberg," Oh! There he goes again.
",2617499,Mom," Previously, on Futurama. 
",2717500,Fry," Bender, I think you might be  playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
",6817501,Bender," I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
",5017502,Younger Mom," A new super fuel, eh?
",2317503,Mom," If the crystals get within six inches of each other...  Wham! All my dark matter will be worthless.
",10117504,Mom," Give me the anti-backwards crystal.
",3717505,Farnsworth," Never! 
Titanius Anglesmith: Welcome to Cornwood!
",5117506,Frydo," What's happening? And why am I enjoying it so much?
",5317507,Leegola," I'm not taking any chances with the Tunneling Horror.
",5517508,Zoidberg," I'm not the Tunneling Horror.
Titanius Anglesmith: The Tunneling Horror! 
Frydo: Why aren't you killing it, Leela? You love killing.
",13417509,Leegola," No, no more killing.
",2217510,Zoidberg," Oh! So, suddenly, Miss Goody Four-shoes over here doesn't kill anymore. She killed me not five minutes ago. What am I? Chopped liver?
",13517511,Leegola," Shut up. 
Zoidberg: Ow! Stop chopping my liver.
",4917512,Leegola," You're on your own.  I refuse to hurt another living thing. 
Frydo: All right. I may be weak and I may be small, but I don't see how I can possibly destroy that monster. Guess I'll just huck whatever's in my pockets at him. At least I can say I tried.
",25317513,Titanius Anglesmith," Any time now.
",1517514,Frydo," The Die of Power. I forgot to remember to roll it.
",5217515,Die of Power," Three.
",817516,Frydo," ""Grow?"" I don't see anything growing. Everything is getting smaller.  Ow. Wait a second. I'm big! In your face, everyone from middle school especially Jeremy.  Wow, that was intense. You guys got to try the Die of Power.
",22217517,Titanius Anglesmith," I'll take a hit.
",1817518,Frydo," Hands off the dodecalicious. 
Greyfarn: Beware, Frydo. Don't be seduced. Hang on a second.  Resist the allure of the die. For to defeat Momon, we must melt it in the super bombastic, bubbling plastic from whence it came.
",22217519,Greyfarn," We must melt it in the super bombastic, bubbling plastic from whence it came.
",7917520,Momon," I send you to kill them and they're not even maimed? That's what I get for sending boys to do a mom's job.
",10817521,Larius," Sorry, Mom.
",1317522,Momon," Sorry doesn't put heads on my table. Peaches.  You're up.
",5917523,Ignus," I like this part but I don't like...
",3817524,Centaur Opponent," You are an able opponent, Hermaphrodite. But hear me well when I posit that we must abhor violence in all its forms.
",11817525,Hermaphrodite," I offer a dissenting opinion.
",3117526,All," 
Hermaphrodite: For abhorring violence is itself an act of violence and, therefore, to be abhorred.  All bow before mighty Hermaphrodite.  Ah! Don't hurt me.
",15917527,Leegola," I'm not here to hurt you. Or anything ever again. Please, teach me the centaurs' ways of wimpiness.
",10117528,Hermaphrodite," What do you offer in return?
",3017529,Titanius Anglesmith," Yes! We made it out of that godforsaken cave. Now, what's the fastest way home? Back through the cave?  Ow!  Ow!
",11417530,Greyfarn," We're close now, my friends. So close, I can practically feel the heat of the fiery molten plastic.
",10117531,Gynecaladriel," You're standing in the fire.
",3017532,Greyfarn," Oh, my.  Alas, our path is blocked by Momon's army of evil. As well as her navy of moral dubiousness.
",10317533,Titanius Anglesmith," Mayhaps we might raise an army of our own. We're but an hour's ride from Wipe Castle.
",8717534,Greyfarn," Of course. Wipe Castle. And while we're there, we can get some of those greasy little dwarf burgers.
",10217535,Gynecaladriel," Ooh! I love those. You can eat like eight of them without gaining any weight because of all the diarrhea.
",10717536,Greyfarn," Sleep deep, fair snoozles. At dawn, we ride for Wipe Castle.  Quiet, Frydo. 
Momon: We've got them now. Send all our forces against Wipe Castle.
",14617537,Waltazar," Right away, Mother. I'll just leave a small contingent behind in case...
",7417538,Momon," I said, everything. Peaches!
",3017539,Peaches," I'm in the tub.
",1717540,Momon," Waltazar, you and Larius shall lead the assault.
",5017541,Waltazar," What about Ignus?
",1917542,Momon," I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission. You see, there is a terrible secret about Ignus I've never told anyone. And here it is.
",13717543,Momon," It's a good day to be evil.  Oh, put a towel on, for crap's sake. 
Frydo: They all wants it. They wants the dodecalicious.
",12417544,Reflection Host," Tell you what, you want to defend a magic artifact, and I mean, defend it good, then what you need is a top-quality knife.
",12417545,Frydo," Me is listening.
",1817546,Reflection Host," The Eviscerator is one of the finest, if not the finest, tactical folder on the market today. We're talking 440 stainless, quick release and... I don't believe this. Is this a stag horn handle at this price?
",20917547,Reflection Host 2," It is, yeah. It's a stag horn.
",3217548,Reflection Host," At this price? You have got to be kidding me. That's got to be some kind of mistake, right there.
",9917549,Reflection Host 2," Now, you folks at home, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, that can't be stag horn. It's got to be the cheaper manticore horn. But, I've got the specs right here and I'll tell you what, this is the real deal.
",22117550,Reflection Host," Unbelievable.
",1517551,Reflection Host 2," It is unbelievable. That's exactly what it is. I mean, this is... I have no words to describe this deal. Honestly, have you ever seen stag horn at this price?
",16017552,Reflection Host," No, no, I don't believe I ever have.
",3817553,Reflection Host 2," 1101-1816 is the item number on this one.
",4317554,Reflection Host," You know what, we're gonna have to  put a clock on this deal, folks. Two minutes. Can I get a clock at two minutes up there?
",12617555,Reflection Host 2," Two minutes at most. Honestly, I'd be surprised if they last that long.
",7317556,Reflection Host," Oh, I'd be very surprised, shocked really. Now, I know the lines are busy, people, but keep dialing in if you want a truly exceptional knife to slice up your friends in their sleep.
",18317557,Titanius Anglesmith," He tried to murder me. He tried... Woah, cool. Is that the stag horn?
",7117558,Greyfarn," Alas, Frydo's weakness was no match for the die's strength. We can only hope he forges on alone to the Geysers.
",11317559,Titanius Anglesmith," I can hope my ass is made of ice-cream but that don't make me a hot fudge sundae.
",8317560,Greyfarn," As for us, we must press on to Wipe Castle, though the journey be long and I fear I may not live to see it.
",10917561,Gynecaladriel," There it is!
",1417562,Frydo," They's following us's.
",2417563,Zoidberg Head," You know, you talk like that, it's gonna cost you points at a job interview.
",7817564,Frydo," What does it wants?
",2117565,Zoidberg Head," I thought I could help you destroy the die, maybe.
",5217566,Frydo,"  Yes, yes, please help me. The die is tearing me apart.  No, it's not. We're having a nice time.  Shut up.  You shut up.  S'all right?  Who's a s'all right?  Help me!
",16817567,URL," Now, before your audience with the king, there's a shocking fact you best know about him.
",9117568,Titanius Anglesmith," Enough blabbety-blab! Open the doors.
",3917569,Roberto," What, ho?
",1117570,Titanius Anglesmith," We bring ill tidings, o fanciest of men. Momon's reach nears the die of power. And should she obtain it, she will then have the entire basic set. Rivers will run red with blood and yellow with urine. And a dog will be seen eating cat food in the land. Oh, great king, your army is the last hope of Cornwood. Let us join forces before the light of good is extinguished forever.
",37817571,Roberto," You calling me crazy? Just 'cause I've got a hotel in my foot don't make me a boogalee-moogalee-moogalee.
",10717572,Titanius Anglesmith," Pardon?
",917573,Roberto," Stop laughing at me, fried avocado.
",3717574,Titanius Anglesmith," Moving along then. As the only nobleman present who's not...  ...I hereby place myself in command of the royal army.
",11817575,URL," What royal army would that be?
",3217576,Greyfarn," What?
",717577,Smitty," King went insane and declared war on the scallops. Tied his army to a boulder and pushed them into the sea. They never returned.
",13017578,URL," Scallops must've got them. 
Greyfarn: Oh, well. There'll be no epic battle today.
",8317579,Titanius Anglesmith," Methinks we be boned.
",2317580,Larius," Where's their army?
",2117581,Waltazar," Maybe they didn't hear the horn. Blow it again. 
URL: Man, I'll show that cat how to blow. 
Titanius Anglesmith: Ow.
",11817582,Roberto,"  What the... You're not made of Tuesday.  My sanity. It's back. At last, I can live the life I always...  AHH! Boogalee-moogalee-moogalee!
",14017583,Man #1," Ow! 
Leegola: What does it mean?
",3417584,Female Centaur," Evil will soon triumph over good.
",3517585,Hermaphrodite," Your friends face certain death. Followed by a disrespectful marionette show performed with their corpses.
",10817586,Leegola," No! We've got to do something.
",3217587,Hermaphrodite," Believe me, we will. We've taken out a sternly worded ad in tomorrow's Cornwood Times. 
Leegola: What a load of man-horse manure.
",13117588,Hermaphrodite," Well, Leegola, if you have a better idea, perhaps you'd like to challenge me to debate.
",8917589,Frydo," I'm too exhausted. I can't go on.
",3517590,Zoidberg Head," I'm here for you, my friend. Grab onto my testicles.
",5417591,Frydo," You know, I think maybe I can walk after all.
",4717592,Momon,"  That's not Wipe Castle.
",2617593,Zoidberg Head," What are you waiting for, Frydo? Throw it already in the boiling plastic.
",7517594,Frydo," I would. But...  Me's enjoys owning it.
",4117595,Zoidberg Head," Stop talking like that. It gives me anxiety. 
Frydo: Ow!
",5817596,Momon," No!
",517597,Die of Power," Twelve.
",917598,Frydo," So, it's all come down to this. A dungeon and dragons.
",5617599,Zoidberg Head," I didn't see it coming.
",2517600,Ogres," Eat the wizard, eat the slut. Eat the robot's shiny butt
",5817601,Gynecaladriel," Well, at least we'll be remembered in song.
",4517602,Titanius Anglesmith," Wait a second. I have an idea. I surrender. Here, eat my friends. Just give me one more second of sweet, sweet life.  Well, that worked out pretty good, eh, fellows?
",16717603,Leegola," Prepare to fire again, brave cowards.
",3917604,Hermaphrodite," I still say, I won the debate. 
Leegola: Fire.
",4817605,Ogre," Wuh-woah.
",1117606,Remaining Ogre," Whew!
",717607,Gynecaladriel," Leegola, you saved us. How can I ever repay you? 
Greyfarn: Frydo is fighting for his life. Quickly, to the Geysers.
",11817608,Titanius Anglesmith,"  Can it wait a couple of minutes?
",3517609,Greyfarn," Yes. Yes, it can.
",1917610,Frydo," You are no match for my dragon style.  I guess you are a match for my dragon style.
",8517611,Momon," Tell me, Frydo, are you aware that a dragon's one weakness is its soft underbelly?
",8417612,Frydo," No. Why do you... 
Leegola: Get my friend out of your mouth.
",6217613,Titanius Anglesmith," It is all over, Momon. We'll soon be down there defeating you. And it's all thanks to the existence of this fragile staircase.  Whoa!
",13517614,Ignus," Quick. Get on the magic bug.
",3017615,Greyfarn," It's not a magic bug, you dope. It's a magic arachnid. Can't you count the legs?
",8217616,Ignus," No.
",517617,Greyfarn," Six, seven, eight. Not six, eight. I'll kill you, you imbecile.
",6517618,Momon," My underbelly. My one weakness.
",3317619,Zoidberg Head,"  I got it. Now I can throw it in the hot thing over there and be the hero. On the other hand, infinite power might be nice.
",12517620,Ignus," Please, I'm trying to help you.
",3317621,Greyfarn," Then why are you hitting me with a stick? How stupid are you that you think that's helping?
",9317622,Ignus," Mommy never told you about my father.
",3917623,Greyfarn," She said he was a foul He-demon.
",3417624,Ignus," Exactly.  You are my father.
",3017625,Greyfarn," No. No, that's impossible.
",2817626,Ignus," Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
",4717627,Greyfarn," No!  No! 
Ignus: Ya-huh! I heard Mommy say so.
",4817628,Zoidberg Head,"  I have all the dice. I am the dungeon master. I know all and see... 
Momon: Game over. 
Frydo: No! No!
",10517629,Mom," What happened?
",1617630,Leela," My God, we're out of that weird, crazy world and back in our regular crazy world.
",8317631,Fry," Did we all just have some kind of freaky dream or was it ghosts?
",6617632,Farnsworth," Neither, Fry. It was science. Bender's mighty imagination amplified by a dark matter resonance created an alternate reality that very nearly blew our minds.
",15817633,Hermes," Exactly. You can't make that kind of stuff up.
",4817634,Mom,"  Quit trying to explain everything. I defeated you in that world and I'll defeat you in this one. Boys, the crystalâ€™s still in his stomach.
",14117635,Walt," Commencing intestinal flash flood.
",3617636,Farnsworth," Wait! Before my moment of shame, can I...
",4317637,Mom," Yes, speak up.
",1617638,Farnsworth," Can I give my boy a hug?
",2617639,Mom," All right. Fine. I've never done it. I guess somebody should.
",6317640,Inger," Daddy. 
Farnsworth: Like father, like son, eh, boy?
",5317641,Igner," We both eated the crysals. 
Mom: No. No!
",4217642,Mom," My dark matter. It's worthless.
",3317643,Farnsworth," That's right, Mom. But fear not, fancy folk for I've just thunk up an alternative energy source. Nibbler-power.
",11317644,Nibbler," Hurray. Wait. What?
",2117645,Farnsworth," Mush! Mush! 
Bender: Whip harder, Professor.
",4617646,Farnsworth," Faster,  faster.  Slower. 
",2817647,Garry Gygax," Anyone wanna play Dungeons & Dragons for the next quadrillion years?
",7017648,Seth MacFarlane," You and I will be reborn,
In a future place and time,
If everything our Hindu brethren say is true.
In an age of things that hover,
You and I will still be lovers,
And we'll say to ourselves
That was then and this is, too.
'Cause we'll still find the happening hot spots,
We'll still cruise the cool casinos.
You'll still fly me to the moon,
Although the moon to which you fly me,
Could be Phobos or Deimos.
The psychic worms from Rigel Nine,
Who control everything we do,
Will make us think that was then,
And 3010 is exactly the same as 1962.
Don't expect any changes, my friend,
That was then and this is, too.
",61517649,Bender," Wow, Mars Vegas.  Long live the eternal city.
",4717650,Leo," Two, one, zero!
",1717651,Bender," Rest in hell, Crapville!
",2617652,Mrs. Wong," Out here in the desert, weâ€™re gonna build bigger, better Vegas.
",6517653,Leo," Bathtubs size of oceans, hookers size of bouncers.
",5217654,Bender,"  Hamburger!
",1317655,Worm Announcer #1," Stand clear of the closing jaws.
",3417656,Amy," So what's gonna be over there, Dad?
",3717657,Leo," That? That the oasis.   Future site of Oasis Hotel.   Take that, you stupid Mother Nature.
",9217658,Frida," Okay. Let's hit him hard.
",2717659,Feministas," This land is your land.  This land is my land
",4717660,Fry," Who are you noisy women?
",2617661,Frida," I'm Frida Waterfall, leader of the Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, and we will not let you man-doze this beautiful gyno-desert.
",13317662,Leo," Well, I'm Leo Wong, and I say, ""Boom!""
",4017663,Frida," What happened to my femi-necklace?  And where's my mega-fem?
",6217664,Farnsworth," Is he badly hurt, Dr. Zoidberg?
",3317665,Zoidberg," I don't quite know how to say this.  Fry is dead!
",5117666,Zoidberg," Wait, not dead.  The other thing.
",3517667,Leo," Damn eco-broads!  You can't even spray for eagles without upsetting these kooks.  
",8417668,Leela," Now, hang on.  Before you do construction, don't you have to make sure you're not harming any native species?
",11117669,Leo," Already done! By top scientist.
",3317670,Farnsworth," Err, what?  Oh, my, yes.  You've got the go-ahead, Mr. Wong.  This place is deader than last year's cat.
",10617671,Leela," No, it's not!  There's precious life right here in this scum puddle.  
",7217672,Farnsworth," Ah! The desert muck leech.  Amazingly, the entire species lives in this one tiny stink hole.   Killing these will be so much easier than exterminating those ponies.
",16617673,Leela," Leeches may not be cuddly like pandas or tribbles, but these poor endangered creatures deserve...  Get off me! 
",11317674,Bender," I'll get it with my trusty foot cups: Stompy and Smashy.
",5817675,Leela," No, don't kill it! We have to...
",3417676,Leo," There. They're not endangered anymore. They're extinct.
",5717677,Leela," No, they're not. I saved this one. And I'm gonna raise it and care for it, so the world will forever know what it's lost.  You freaking slime wad!   No. I killed it. It was the last of its kind.   Let go of me, you...    Poor thing.
",23417678,Leo," Tell you what, Fry. You all promise not to sue me, I give you token for free entry in poker tournament.  He took it, you all saw it!
",13417679,Bender," Maybe we did, maybe we didn't.   What's in it for me, Bender?
",6317680,Leo," Okay, okay. Come back when New Vegas opens, I give you all free rooms, free dinner and free tickets to Celine Dion.
",11717681,Bender," Lose the Celine Dion tickets and you got yourself a deal.
",5917682,Leo," All right, damn it, done!
",2717683,Bender," All right, I scored.
",2217684,Zoidberg," Look out, Vegas, I've got a system.  Oh. I'm bankrupt.
",5617685,Fry,"  You said it, Hermes. He is pathetic, but lovable.
",5217686,Hermes," Yup. What? I said no such thing, man.
",3917687,Fry," I am not acting weird, Leela. Why is everyone talking at once?
",6417688,Leela," Fry, calm down and stop braining.
",3517689,Amy," Yeah, Fry, maybe you need to-
",3117690,Fry," You're right, Amy! Maybe I do need some fresh air.
",5217691,Bender," Man, I'm worried about him. But not enough to stop gambling for even a single second.
",8717692,Three Leos on the Machine," You win, damn it!
",1917693,Fry," Voices always yelling. Who - who said that? I'm not insane. Stop it. Stop talking in me!
",9017694,Hutch Waterfall Waterfall," Voices bothering you, man? You need one of these doodangs.  
",6217695,Fry," A foil hat? Of course, he likes pastrami. What about the dog's testicles?  Hey, it worked. The voices stopped.
",11217696,Hutch Waterfall," They've got a huge selection of carburetors... Hang on. Hang on.  That's better. My name's Hutch.
",9917697,Fry," Hi, Hutch. So what's with the obnoxious, shrieking voices? Are my fillings picking up The View?
",9717698,Hutch Waterfall," No, man. Truth is, it's other people's thoughts. You're a mind reader.
",7217699,Fry," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Although, actually, it was sort of obvious.
",6917700,Hutch Waterfall," You don't believe me? Take off the helmet.
",4417701,Fry," I believe you.
",1617702,Hutch Waterfall," Seriously, do it.  : Testing, testing. Do you read me?
",5617703,Fry," Loud and clear.
",1717704,Hutch Waterfall," What?
",717705,Fry," I said, ""Loud and clear."" Only I said it with my thinker, not my talker.
",7417706,Hutch Waterfall," Whoa! Freaky. Why can't I read your thoughts?
",4717707,Fry," I don't know. Wait. What's that about a secret society?
",5717708,Hutch Waterfall," Never mind that. Just keep the foil on and you'll be okay. Also, it'll keep the Dark Ones from incinerating your brain.
",12117709,Fry," That's a plus.
",1617710,Hutch Waterfall," And don't ever, ever, ever tell anyone you can read minds, or the Dark Ones will get you like that.  Hang on, pizza grease. Like that. 
",13717711,Clamps," I'd like to get my clamps on those. Give her a jump, you know what I mean?  
",7817712,Donbot," Whoa, whoa. Show some decorum there, Clamps. This ain't no strip show. This is a beguiling display of the pornographic arts.
",12617713,Joey Mousepad," Yo, Skip, I can see a guy's butt.
",3517714,Michaels Wife," Oh, Michael, this is the perfect end to a perfect honeymoon.
",6217715,Michael," I love you so much.
",2117716,Bender," Is this seat taken?
",2117717,Michael," Actually, we...
",1717718,Bender," Slide me those chicken wings. So what part of Podunk you rubes from?
",7017719,Michael," The north-eastern.
",2017720,Announcer #1," Monsieurs et mademoiselles, our circus of the senses now arrives by steamboat in New Orleans, circa 2873. The muted lament of a trombone resonates through the fog, which lingers even now, months after the attack of the fog monster. With but one hope of restoring Gearoticus to his throne, our sensual fate rests in the gyrations of... Fanny.
",34317721,Bender," Oh. 
",617722,Fanny," Yes?
",617723,Bender," I'm Bender. Let's do it.  
",2817724,Donbot," Who is it, the Feds?
",2217725,Bender,"  Aren't you the Donbot, head of the Robot Mafia?
",5017726,Donbot," Allegedly. And this is my beloved wife, Fanny, whose honor I would proudly defend with a power drill. Well, I gotta go drown a stoolie.
",13717727,Donbot," I'm gonna be in here a while, so do me a favor and drive my wife home. It's one of them self-driving cars, so just sit in the back and do whatever.
",14917728,Fanny," Oh, Bender, your lips are intoxicating. It's like kissing an ashtray full of hot wings.
",8917729,Bender," Aww yeahh!
",1217730,Fry," My God, I really can read minds. I have a superpower! There must be something great I can do with this.
",10517731,Fry," Hello, ladies, I can read your thoughts.  Oh, wait, that's invisibility.
",7417732,Fry," Poker. With my mind-reading abilities and my invisibility... Wait, no, just the mind reading. I can't lose!
",10917733,Fry," Sign me up for the tournament, please.
",4017734,Administrator," Okey-doke, Jiffy Pop. Entry fee's 50,000 smackers.
",5217735,Fry," 50,000? Drat, all I have is my life savings and a token for free admission to this poker tournament.
",10217736,Administrator," Close enough. 
",1617737,Amy," You're having an affair with the head of the robot mafia's wife?
",6617738,Bender," Yup, this is her I'm making out with.
",3917739,Hermes," Bender, are you crazy?
",2417740,Bender," No, it's Fry who's crazy in this one.
",3917741,Fry," Psht, I'm not crazy.
",2217742,Leela," You sure you're okay, Fry? You do have tin foil on your head.
",6317743,Fry," So? You've got a leech on your neck. Oh, and speaking of sucking on your neck, want to go to a movie later?
",10917744,Elzar," Hey, there! How are you folks doing tonight?
",4617745,Bender," Great. What are the specials?
",3117746,Elzar," We've got a wonderful grizzly bear that's been dipped in cornmeal and lightly tormented. Questions?
",10117747,Amy," What was the bear's name?
",2717748,Elzar," Jojo.
",717749,Amy," Ooh, I'll have him.
",2117750,Bender," Hide me!
",1017751,Joey Mousepad," Hey, Donbot, ain't that your wife what with you had that wedding with?
",7217752,Fanny,"  Donbot, honey! What a pleasant shock! I was just having dinner alone, when suddenly you walk in on us.
",10517753,Donbot," Alone, huh?
",1317754,Bender," Where am I? I was exploring a wormhole through space many light years from this restaurant, when suddenly I was surrounded by darkness.  Hot, sexy darkness.  Oh, why, hello, Donbot! Hello, miss, have we met?  I'm Bender. The world's most sexual robot. I mean, the world's most boundary-respecting robot.
",30517755,Donbot," Nice to see you, Bender. Welcome back to our universe. Listen, sugar, I stuck up the Burlington Coat Factory and got you a little something. It's a $49 value.
",16017756,Danny," Donbot, I love you!  Not really.
",3417757,Bender," Man, this is great! I always wanted to nail a dame in a fur coat, and now's my chance.  I mean, if you'll introduce me to one, sir.  One as sexy as you, baby! Bender out. 
",17317758,Fanny," I never felt so alive, Bender. Listen, this turquoise-encrusted bra is worth 50 grand. Let's sell it and run off before the Donbot gets wise.
",14317759,Bender,"  No. It will take a lot more money than that to make a girl like you happy.
",7717760,Fanny," No, it won't.
",1517761,Bender," Yeah, it will. Shut up! We'll run off, after I win the Universal Poker Championship!  One entry, please.
",10617762,Fanny," Bender, no! You're not lucky enough.
",3817763,Bender," Oh, no? I'm 40% lucky.  The scrap metal I'm made from included a truckload of horseshoes from the luckiest racehorses in Mexico, who had just been sent to a glue factory.
",17217764,Fanny," They don't sound so lucky to me.
",3417765,Bender," Not without their shoes.
",2617766,Fanny," Here, Bendy, take this. It will give you 70% more luck. It's the Donbot's lucky robot's foot.
",9517767,Bender," All right! With two kinds of luck, I can't lose.
",5017768,Bender," No, wait, three. I stepped on a leprechaun.
",4517769,Joey Mousepad," Yo, you see this over here over there?
",4017770,Clamps," I'm powering up the clamps.
",2917771,Donbot," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let us not rush to judgement.
",4917772,Joey Mousepad," But, Skip, that was your lucky robot's foot what came off of your lucky leg.
",7817773,Donbot,"  While it is true that I did wake up with only one foot this morning, there is no proof that my beloved Fanny was involved. Aside from the hacksaw I found under her pillow.
",17417774,Clamps," Well, what about that Bender guy? You want I should give him the clamps?
",7417775,Donbot," Not yet, Clamps. We are gonna sit tight and see if he wins the poker tournament. He does, that proves he's packing my lucky foot, in which event...
",14917776,Clamps," The clamps! Or a clamp-like device.
",3717777,Penn Jillette," Welcome viewers who fell asleep with the TV on! It's the 3009 no-limit hold 'em championship.  I'm the massive head of Penn Jillette, and here with a color commentary, my partner Teller.  Our act really didn't change much when he died.
",23717778,Bender," Pardon me, I'm new to this game. Is this duffle bag big enough for all your money? 
",8517779,Fry,"  Bender? Oh, boogers. We're in the same tournament. Quick, get your entry fee back before I bankrupt you.
",10717780,Bender," Pfft! In your dreams, nutloaf.
",3217781,Fry," Bite my shiny metal hat.
",2617782,Penn Jillette," Tex Connecticut, the pride of Kansas City, first to act.  Smiley Spiff, up next.  Looks like Boobs Vanderbilt has a decent pair. Also, she's got two eights.  And Bender Rodriguez picks up a lucky deal right off the bat. 
",22217783,Bender," Woo! Two aces. I'm thinking guitar solo. 
",4317784,Fry," He puts his hat back down.] I fold.
",3717785,Penn Jillette," Holy crap! A stunning play by mentally ill newcomer Philip Fry. It's almost as if he knew Bender had two aces.
",11217786,Boobs Vanderbilt," Bender has two aces? I'm out.
",3117787,Tex Connecticut," I'm out.
",1017788,Lrrr," I'm out.
",1017789,Bender,"  Suck my luck!
",1617790,Donbot," See this gun?  That's what I'm gonna do to Bender if he wins.
",6317791,Lrrr," All in. Call my mighty bid at your peril.  : My cards are awful, and I need a hug.
",8417792,Fry," I call your bluff.
",2017793,Lrrr," I shall annihilate... Fry hugs him.]  I just wanted to make my daddy proud.
",7717794,Lrrrs Father," Well, you didn't. I want you and your junk moved out by Monday.
",6517795,Penn Jillette," It's getting pretty intense, folks. Based on the state of decomposition of Teller's head, we're now in hour 19 of the tournament. And the first bad deal of the night for Bender.
",17917796,Bender," Hey, pal, help me out here.  This is the worst possible hand, right?
",7017797,Tex Connecticut," I'm all in.
",1317798,Bender," All in! I mean, fold. Whatever.
",3317799,Penn Jillette,"  Well, Bender's luck just ran out. No card can save him from elimination.
",7517800,Boobs Vanderbilt," Oh, my gourds! He's dead. 
",2817801,Leo Wong," 21, winner! 
",1417802,Bender," Wooo! I'm so full of luck, it's shooting out like luck diarrhoea.
",6717803,Penn Jillette," Wake up, poker fans! We're down to our final two players in heads-up action for the Championship. Your perspective, Teller? 
",12617804,Bender," All in.
",917805,Fry," But-but, you didn't even look at your cards!
",4617806,Bender," Looking at one's cards is a crutch for players who rely on skill.
",6717807,Leo Wong," Any day now, Fry. You in or out?
",3417808,Bender," What's the matter, Fry, you scared? Or just  crazy? 
",5417809,Fry," All right, all in.  Yes! Four aces!
",3717810,Bender,"  Ah-ah-ah. Read 'em and weep, and then tell me what they are.
",6317811,Leo Wong," Two kings. And with three on the board, that gives Bender five kings.
",7117812,Fry," But how is that...
",2017813,Penn Jillette," I don't believe it. Bender has just been dealt the King of Beers, a coaster from the bar that somehow got mixed into the deck. But it still counts!
",14917814,Leo Wong," Bender win the Championship!
",3017815,Bender,"  That's some good money. 
",2717816,Fanny,"  You did it, Bender. You're the greatest.
",4317817,Bender," Tell me something I don't know, sweetass. Now, let's boogie. We'll be in Space Tahiti before the Donbot knows what hit him.
",12517818,Donbot," Now I am suspicious.
",2217819,Bender," Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave. Can we go now?
",6217820,Hermesand Zoidberg," Previously, on Futurama. 
",2717821,Hutch Waterfall," You need one of these doodangs.  
",3517822,Fry," A foil hat? 
",1417823,Hutch Waterfall," Truth is, you're a mind reader.
",3317824,Fry," Oh, my God!
",1317825,Amy," You're having an affair with the head of the robot mafia's wife? 
",6717826,Bender," Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave.
",4717827,Fry," Poor Bender left me one last voicemail before the Robot Mafia buried him in the desert.
",8917828,Bender," Fry, old friend, before I die, I just wanted to say...  Hang on, I'm getting another call. Hello? 
",10017829,Hermes," Line up, people! Everyone take a shovel and one sixth of the planet. We'll meet back here in 50 years, our bodies broken and our lives wasted.
",14417830,Zoidberg," And you say these are free shovels?
",3717831,Bender," I'm back, baby.
",1717832,Fry," Bender! I thought the Robot Mafia killed you.
",4717833,Bender," Nah, they just shot us and buried us a few times as a warning.
",6417834,Fanny," Bender was so brave. He never stopped making out with me the whole time they were shooting us.
",9617835,Bender," I sure didn't.
",1617836,Fanny," I gotta get back to my husband, baby. Will I see you tonight?
",6317837,Bender," Probably not.
",1517838,Leo," It's a 14-footer with a clown hazard. What club you recommend, Baggy?
",7117839,Baggy," As on every hole, I suggest the putter.
",4117840,Fry," Your golf club sure is classy, Mr. Wong. Naked statue classy.
",6317841,Leela," It is very nice. I just wish Amy and I didn't have to wear these sexist badges on our melons. 
",9617842,Amy," We're lucky even to play as guests, Leela. Dad's club has a very strict ""No girls allowed"" policy.
",10017843,Leela," That doesn't seem fair.
",2517844,Amy," It really is. Everybody knows women don't have the focus to play miniature golf at a professional level.
",10617845,Leela," But that's the best shot of the day!
",3817846,Leo," Is that my ball? I think that my ball.
",4017847,Amy," Pfft, great putt, Dad.
",2417848,Leo," Okay, we're done.
",1917849,Leela," Mr. Wong, how do you keep this place so green in the middle of the desert? Doesn't that waste a lot of water?
",11117850,Leo," Nah, we got plenty water, pumped directly from flamingo lake.  They'll be fine. 
",8217851,Leo," Oh, yeah, I love miniature golf. Love everything about it, except how damn miniature it is. That's why I'm building the universe's biggest miniature golf course.
",16317852,Leo," This the first tee.
",2117853,Fry," Where's the hole?
",1917854,Leo," On Pluto's moon, Hydra. It's a six-billion-mile par-two. Tough shot, even for a man.  : Around the sun. Bank off Jupiter. And right into the...  I'll be right back.  It dropped in! Put me down for a two.
",20517855,Amy," Two. 
",717856,Leo," Keep in mind, that just the first hole. For full course, we gonna bulldoze this entire arm of the Milky Way.
",11017857,Leela," What? You're gonna wipe out 10% of the galaxy for a stupid golf course?
",7317858,Leo," First of all, it 12% . Second, yes, you betcha.
",4917859,Leela," But you have no idea what life forms might be evolving out there.
",6717860,Leo," That's exactly why I'm hiring an impartial scientist to perform an environmental survey. That's him in the money shower.
",12217861,Fry," Delivery boy's log. Having fallen asleep on what I thought was the toilet, I awoke to find the environmental survey in progress.
",13017862,Farnsworth," Status reports, Science Officer.
",3417863,Bender," Zilcho. No sign of life or intelligence.  : Just like Fry on a date.
",7017864,Fry,"  Hey!
",717865,Leela," Okay, so we haven't found any life yet. I still don't see why you men can't be happy with regular-sized miniature golf.
",12117866,Farnsworth," Leela, evolution has programmed our fabulous male brains to take anything anybody else thinks is important and make it bigger.  Have you seen my new 301-inch TV?
",16317867,Announcer #1," Hypnotoad is brought to you by the MagnaPhallix 302-inch TV. It's bigger!
",7517868,Farnsworth," Oh, hell! 
",1217869,Bender,"  Captain, I'm detecting life on the Spock-o-scope!
",5217870,Leela," It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
",5017871,Fry," Except in Kansas.
",1917872,Bender," But isn't Mr. Wong building the 18th hole here? And the golf pants museum?
",7617873,Farnsworth," Indeed so. This whole area will be incinerated when he implodes that sun there into a black hole.
",9917874,Leela," That beautiful violet star?
",2917875,Farnsworth," It's so you can't keep your ball at the end of the game.
",5817876,Fry," Yo, that's messed up.
",2317877,Leela," There won't be any imploding once they read our environmental review. Right, Professor?
",8917878,Farnsworth," Ohh, twaddle-squat. There's no scientific consensus that life is important.
",7717879,Bender," Yeah. Life, schmife.
",2217880,Clip Board,"  Approved for demolition.
",2717881,Leela," It's you and me, ponytail. 
",2917882,Guard #1," We're here, Mr. President.
",2817883,Richard Nixons head," Arroo! Let's play some mini-golf.
",3517884,Nixon," Just give it a light tap, Agnew.  No, no, no, just a light...
",6317885,Zoidberg," Now for a triple clam dip, with a double -  OW!  OW!
",5417886,Nixon," Tough luck, Agnew. Looks like you and Wong owe me a Charleston Chew.  
",7217887,Feministas," Shut up and hear our wisdom. Save the ecosystem. Shut up and hear our wisdom!
",7917888,Nixon," What gives, Wong? You said no chicks allowed.
",4717889,Frida," We are the Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, and we will not let you...What was it again?
",9317890,Leela," We will not let you implode the violet dwarf star at galactic coordinates 167.84, -58.03, mark 948.
",10117891,Leo," Already approved, you cackling hens. So get out, or I'll have vice-president Agnew's headless body throw you out.
",11517892,Leela," I'd like to see him try.
",2617893,Nixon," Me, too. Should look funny. Sic 'em, Agnew.
",4517894,Nixon," Runaway golf cart!
",2017895,Leela," Look out, Agnew!
",1817896,Nixon," Whoa!
",717897,Leo," Aah!
",617898,Leela," Is... is he okay?
",1917899,Leo," No pulse.
",1117900,Nixon," They killed the headless remains of Agnew. Arrest them!
",5717901,Frida," All Feministas she-vacuate the premises. I mean ""femises.""
",6017902,Nixon," My fellow Earthicans, these eco-crooks will face the maximum sentence. For killing a headless torso, that's six weeks.
",12017903,Bender," Well, this is embarrassing. Here I've been blabbing on for years about killing all humans, and who actually does something about it? Some chick.
",14617904,Fry," Leela's not a killer, and she's not some chick. She's the chick I love. And don't tell her I called her a chick, or she'll kill me.
",13317905,Frida," Everyone stay absolutely quiet!
",3317906,Feminista," That thing's on. Shh!
",2317907,Feminista," Turn it off!
",1417908,Frida," Oh, sorry.
",1217909,Frida," How do you turn it off?
",2517910,Frida," There. Did that do it?
",2417911,Others," No. Stop it. Shut up.
",2317912,Frida," Here's the button here.  : And I think I... Now I got it.
",5917913,Leela," Let me give you a hand.
",2517914,Frida," This is awful. I never meant for our protest to have any effect.
",6617915,Trixie," Maybe we should just surrender and serve our six weeks in jail.
",6517916,Dixie," Hey, yeah! We could do each other's toenails and make shivs.
",6217917,Leela," That's crazy. We've done nothing wrong, other than killing and dismembering the vice-president. We need to make a choice, sisters. We can either keep pestering criminals like Leo Wong with silly slogans...
",20717918,All," Yeah. Let's do that.
",2217919,Leela," Actually, I meant that to be the less preferable alternative. We can either chant slogans or we can take action.
",11417920,Dixie," What was the first choice again?
",3417921,Leela," I choose to save the environment by sabotaging Leo Wong's golf course. Who's with me?
",8717922,Frida," Could we still use our bullhorns?
",3517923,Leela," Absolutely. Bullhorns are a core principle of eco-feminism.
",6117924,Frida," Then I'm in.
",1417925,Leela," Who's ready to kick some sweaty man-butt?
",4317926,Dixie," I've got my pointy man-kicking shoes on.
",4217927,Trixie," Those are cute.
",1717928,Dixie," Aren't they? I got them at Nine West.
",3917929,Leela," Simmer down, warriors. Full power to the vagyroscope!
",5517930,Leo," Those dirty rings. I tried soaking them out, even blasting them out.
",7017931,Frida," Are you sure about this? It would be better for propaganda if we weren't using refined sugar.
",9517932,Leela," It's okay. The potato we're shoving in the tailpipe is organic.
",6517933,Leo," I smell sabotage.  Ooh, and potatoes.
",3917934,Leela," Now, unfortunately, the media is going to put a negative spin on this, like when we killed that guy, so to win public support, we'll need a lovable mascot.
",15717935,Zoidberg,"Â : Squirm all you want, you nasty dumpling. One less species for the universe, one more breakfast for...
",10517936,Leela," Zoidberg?
",1117937,Zoidberg," Leela. Me saving things the leech. Not the eating of it.
",5817938,Leela," Zoidberg, I'm very surprised at you, slightly.
",4817939,Fry," Psst! Leela.
",1417940,Leela," Shh! I'm a fugitive.
",2217941,Fry," I know. I miss you so much, Leela, even more than when you were here.
",7117942,Leela," I miss you, too, Fry. And you probably think what I'm doing is wrong. But it's something I really care about...
",11317943,Fry," You don't have to explain, Leela. You're you. That's all I need to know.
",7417944,Leela," Goodbye, sweet goofbag.
",2517945,Bender,"Â : I'll miss her, too, buddy. Dibs on her iPod.
",4817946,Zoidberg," Dibs on her- ohh...
",2117947,Hutch Waterfall," Hey, Fry! Long time, man.
",2717948,Fry," Hey, Hutch! What have you been up to?
",3917949,Hutch Waterfall," Same old, same old. Searching the dumpsters, protecting my thoughts with tin foil, peeing myself.
",9917950,Fry," So, what brings you to Earth?
",3117951,Hutch Waterfall," It's top secret. Hey, take off your helmet and I'll think it to you.
",7017952,Fry," Okay. Here goes.
",1817953,Fry," Where are you? And me?
",2417954,Hutch Waterfall," The Great Hall of the Ancient Legion of Madfellows. Welcome, bro.
",6717955,All," Welcome, bro.
",1517956,Hutch Waterfall," Sorry I bashed your head in, buddy, but I had to. You see, the fate of the universe depends on you.
",10117957,Fry," Yeah, I get that a lot.
",2517958,Hutch Waterfall," The Grand Curator will tell you more.
",3917959,Fry," Take me to him.
",1717960,Nine," Hey, man.
",1117961,Fry," Hey.
",617962,Nine," So dig this, Fry. Our commune has been monitoring the universe's life energy for, like, a really long time, and we're grokking some super weird junk.
",15117963,Fry," Um, I don't mean to be rude, but it's kind of hard to take you seriously when you say junk like ""grok"" and ""junk.""
",11617964,NineÂ ," What about ""commune""?
",2317965,Fry," Especially ""commune."" Come on, it's the fate of the universe, puff it up a little. Like you could say your ancient order is sensing deep upheaval in the cosmic life energy field.
",18017966,Nine," Okay. I'll try. So, like, a really, really long time ago...  Eons ago!  Cool. Eons ago, the life force we call Chee permeated the universe.  The Green Chee generated a great upwelling of life across the cosmos. But then, for reasons unknown...
",24517967,Fry," Ooh. ""Reasons unknown."" Now that's the sort of hook that grabs the attention of me, the viewer.
",9717968,Nine," For reasons unknown...
",2417969,Fry," Nice.
",717970,Nine," ...the Chee began to recede, and the diversity of life began to wither. The life forms we know today are but a fraction of a fraction of the magnificence that once existed.
",17417971,Hutch Waterfall," But a bunch of dudes, right, they totally passed this far-out knowledge down through the ages.
",9617972,Nine," Some with this knowledge were called prophets, some, fruitcakes. We, the Legion of Madfellows, are their heirs.
",11317973,Fry," Hey, I'm on TV. 
",1817974,Nine," Well, that's the show. 
",2517975,Fry," Neat. What's it got to do with me?
",3617976,Nine," Ahh, pooperdoodle! I mean, pardon the omission. You see, after untold eternities, we have sensed a resurgence in the Chee.
",12417977,Fry," Hey, that's the violet dwarf star that Leela wants to save.
",6117978,Hutch Waterfall," Freaking nailed it, corndog.
",3017979,Nine," We believe this star heralds a new green age, and it's your destiny to be its shepherd and protector.
",10317980,Fry," Me? Why?
",1017981,Hutch Waterfall," 'Cause you got, like, no delta brainwave, man. The Dark Ones can't groove off your thoughts.
",9417982,Nine," Silence, Hutch! For now, let's just say we have enemies, enemies who can read minds, except yours. 
",10117983,Fry," Cool. I can't wait to tell Leela.
",3517984,Nine," No! If you tell anyone, then their thoughts could be read. For the sake of those you love, you must keep this secret. Do you foot-swear?
",13817985,Fry," Oh, okay. I foot-swear.
",2517986,Nine," Good. Now, to save the coming of the green age, you must stop this man.
",7317987,Fry," I know him. Leo Wong. I work with his daughter.
",4917988,Nine," Oh, good, that will cut about 15 minutes of explanation. You must gain Wong's confidence, infiltrate his organization and prevent him from destroying the violet dwarf.
",16917989,Leo," Looking for a job, eh?
",2417990,Fry," Yes, sir. Nothing fancy. I'm willing to start at the bottom and infiltrate my way up.
",8717991,Leo," Sorry, no openings right now. : What I need is security guard to keep nutcases out of my office.
",9817992,Fry," I'm good at keeping nutcases.
",3117993,Leo," I said no way. : This idiot don't look like he could handle those feministas.
",7917994,Fry," I look like an idiot who can handle those feministas.
",5517995,Leo," He'll have to do better than that.
",3617996,Fry," I'll have to do better than that.
",3517997,Leo," Hmm. You and I think a lot alike. You really think you can stand up to those eco-freakos?
",9117998,Fry," Sir, with me around, they'll be the least of your worries.
",6017999,Tester," Stand by, men. And manly aliens. Prepare to test fire King Kong hole.
",7118000,Sal," It workses.
",1318001,Tester," Good job, men. And manly aliens. Construction of King Kong hole complete.
",7518002,Frida," Typical. Always King Kong, never Queen... Quong.
",5018003,Sal," What are those, hooks? Get out of heres, you hookers.
",5518004,Sal,"  Helpses!
",1118005,Leela," You go, gorillaÂ !
",1918006,Morbo," Our top story. The string of eco-vandalism that began with a harmless vice-presidential killing has spread across the galaxy.
",12718007,Linda," Why do you always get to read the top story, Morbo?
",5318008,Morbo," Because viewers trust a deep male voice and huge, throbbing forehead veins. 
",7818009,Linda," Not all reaction to the crime spree has been negative. We spoke with several people who viewed these courageous eco-feminists as heroes.
",13818010,Petunia," I just wish there was some way to... Excuse me.  Some way to show I support 'em. Send them some smokes or something.
",11818011,Linda," This just in: Root 2 News has received a video communique from the eco-feminists' unknown hideout.
",10018012,Leela," This is sub-commander L., with a message for Leo Wong. Leo, you're a parasite on the universe, and parasites must be destroyed. That's why we've adopted this parasite as our mascot.  I know it's a little confusing. The point is, even this vicious leech has a right to exist. And that's why a vicious leech like Leo Wong must be exterminated.  Again, confusing. Feministas unite! 
",38118013,Morbo," In other news- 
",1718014,Linda," Feministas unite!
",1918015,Linda," Feministas unite! 
",2018016,Nixon," Incredible. Absolutely incredible. You're telling me this TiVo machine can pause and rewind live TV?
",10218017,Leo," These crazy broads gonna ruin me, Nixon. You gotta help me. Send the army or something. Something big that shoots.
",11618018,Nixon," Sir, I don't care if you are my biggest contributor. Our armed forces do not serve your private business interests.
",11718019,Leo," Sorry, I...
",1318020,Nixon,"  I'm just yanking your chain, Leo. I'm on it like boring on Gerry Ford.
",7318021,Zapp," Zapp Brannigan purporting for duty. For the love of God, Kif, less piccolo, more fife.
",8818022,Nixon," Report, Brannigan.
",2018023,Zapp," Mr. President, I failed to identify these curvaceous banditas despite hours of staring at their dossiers.  Yet, I seemed to have stroked myself upon good luck, for a patriot of the highest order has volunteered to lead us to them.
",23218024,Bender," Hey-oh!
",918025,Leela," Previously, on Futurama.
",2618026,Nine," You must gain Wong's confidence, infiltrate his organization and prevent him from destroying the violet dwarf. 
",11318027,Hutch Waterfall," The fate of the universe depends on you.
",4218028,Fry," Yeah, I get that a lot.
",2518029,Leela," It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
",5018030,Fry," Except in Kansas.
",1918031,Leo," I smell sabotage.
",1918032,Leela," Feministas unite! 
",2018033,Zapp," A patriot of the highest order has volunteered to lead us to them.
",6818034,Bender," Hey-oh!
",918035,Nixon," These eco-feminists are ruthless criminals who'll stop at nothing to save the environment. I don't see how a bending unit can catch them.
",13918036,Bender," Not just any bending unit, Presidente. I happen to be brilliant, fearless and short on cash. 
",9518037,Nixon," Slush him, Kroker.
",2018038,Zapp," Bender here has identified the femdito commander as my ex-lover, Turanga Leela, whom I once made love at.
",10718039,Nixon," And he's willing to fink her out for a few simoleons?
",5518040,Bender," It's not about the money, Nixon, though I'd like much more. She's committed 30 felonies in 12 star systems. If no one stops her, she'll break my record for longest rap sheet.
",17618041,Nixon," That's a despicable motive, Bender, and I respect it.
",5518042,Bender," Gracias. Now, I could find Leela, but you'll need to authorize a wiretap.
",7518043,Nixon," As many as you like.
",2218044,Bender," I only need one.
",1818045,Nixon," Let's call it six.
",2018046,Fry," Hey, Bender, check it out. I'm Leo Wong's new security guard. I got an ID badge and a flashlight, and I ordered this mustache.
",12818047,Bender," Neat. Say, speaking of whatever the hell you just said, I need to make a cell phone telephone call. Can borrow your cell phone telephone?
",13918048,Fry," Okay, but don't restart my Tetris. I was finally about to get one of those pieces that looks like a backwards ""L.""
",11618049,Bender," Okay, superstud.
",1818050,Leo," Looking good, security. No feministas getting past you.
",5718051,Fry," No, sir. Not on my mustache's watch.
",3818052,Amy," Fry, I can't believe you're working with my dad against Leela. How can you claim to be her friend and still want her in jail?
",12718053,Leo," Don't mind cranky-pants here. She been cranky ever since she was a fat little girl.
",8518054,Amy," Dad!
",618055,Leo," Can I be brutally honest, Fry? I always wanted a son.
",5518056,Fry," That hurt, but I can take it.
",3118057,Amy," I knew you wanted a son! Why do you think I became a miniature golf champion? Why do you think I wear these stupid boys' sweat suits?
",13518058,Leo," To hide your big, fat butt, that's why. 
",4218059,Fry," Now, sir, in fairness, Amy's butt is actually pretty hot.
",5918060,Amy," What is it with you men? Why does everything revolve around my butt?
",7018061,Leo," 'Cause it's so big and massive. He and Fry share a laugh.]
",6018062,Fry," Sorry.
",818063,Amy," That's it!
",1218064,Bender," Whoa! What's with Big Butt?
",2918065,Leo," She just hungry.
",1818066,Bender," Here you go, Fry.
",1918067,Fry," Thanks.
",918068,Bender," Oh! FYI, I dropped that Tetris piece in the wrong place and ended the game.
",7718069,Fry,"  No!
",618070,Fry," Great! Now Amy's gonna tell Leela I'm a jerk. If only I could explain I'm on a secret mission against evil. Wait. Evil? Yeah, yeah, evil.  What's going on in there? A scary noise?  Hey, you're one of Leela's feministas. ""Save the environment! Wo-mandate Leo's retirement!"" That's terrible writing! Stop making your point so ineffectively! 
",34118071,Frida," Take your mands off of me!
",2818072,Fry,"  I'm on your side.
",2018073,Frida,"  Don't shush me.
",1818074,Fry," Please, can you take a message to Leela?
",4218075,Frida,"  What is it?
",1418076,Fry," Just say her sweet goofbag is working to save the violet dwarf star, just like she is.
",8818077,Frida," Very well, I'll fem-municate your man-formation.
",5018078,Fry,"  Just tell her.
",1718079,Farnsworth," Well, this is it, old friends. Planet Express is done for, what with our delivery crew missing and the abysmal sales of Tickle Me Bender.
",13918080,Bender Doll,"  Quit touching my junk, pervert!
",3418081,Farnsworth," Hold out your hands and I'll remove your career chips.
",5618082,Zoidberg," I hate to see it come to an end.  When will it end?
",5318083,Hermes," Shouldn't you get that, Professor?
",3618084,Farnsworth," I suppose.  Hello?
",2018085,Leo," Professor, old buddy, I'm gonna blow up the violet dwarf star. So I need you deliver billion-mile security fence to keep out protesters. Dirty business. Lot of money. You corrupt enough?
",18818086,Farnsworth," Damn skippy!  Good news, crybabies! We're back in business.
",6118087,Hermes," Sweet kookaburra of Edinburgh, Professor. You sure you know how to fly this thing?
",8418088,Farnsworth," I invented it, didn't I? You wouldn't ask Thomas Edison whether he knew how to use a sexmatron.
",9718089,Leela," Halt! What are you doing in this parallelogram of space?
",5818090,Farnsworth," We're delivering a fence to keep you ladies in your place. 
",6118091,Zoidberg," Amy?
",618092,Hermes," Labarbara?
",1218093,Labarbara," That's right, husband. From now on, you make your own Manwiches.
",6618094,Mrs. Wong," That was the greatest play I ever saw. It must have had 20 acts.
",6618095,Leela," We installed your fence, Leo Wong.
",3618096,Linda," Should we shout a clever slogan?
",3418097,Leela," You mean something like, ""The best defense is a good fence?""
",6218098,Linda," Yeah, something like that, only funny.
",4018099,Leela," I wish we could, but our chief slogan writer is back at the Honeybun Hideout.
",7918100,Frida," Does ""violet dwarf"" rhyme with ""men are dorks""? It does through a megaphone. : That reminds me, I've got to tell Leela about that weirdo who wants to save the violet dwarf.
",17418101,Mysterious Voice," So, the Legion of Madfellows has a new pawn, eh?
",5018102,Frida," Is somebody here? If you're the DSL guy, you're two days late.
",6418103,Mysterious Voice," Who gave you that message for Leela?
",3818104,Frida," I don't know his name.
",2418105,Mysterious Voice," Then you are of no use to the Dark Ones!
",4218106,Frida," Long lost brother, avenge my death.
",3718107,Fry," Six, seven, eight. Lock the gate. One, two, three. Turn the key. 30, 50, 10.  My dirty, shifty friend?
",10418108,Hutch Waterfall," Hey, Fry, long time.
",2218109,Hutch Waterfall," Welcome back to the Legion of Madfellows, man.
",4818110,Fry," Why'd you bonk me, you idiot? You could have just asked me to come with you. And where are we? This doesn't look like your regular dumpster.
",14218111,Nine," All in good time! I guess now is a good time. We're on Mars, in a forgotten cavern abandoned by the native Martians a million years ago.
",13818112,Fry," Actually, it was five years ago. I remember 'cause they washed my socks.
",7418113,Nine," You have done well, Fry. You have ingratiated yourself with Leo Wong.
",7118114,Fry," Yup, I kissed his ass from cheek to shining cheek. So, what do I do next?
",7518115,Nine," As Wong security chief, you will be on hand when he attempts to destroy the violet dwarf. You must not let that happen.
",12118116,Fry,"  ""Must let happen.""
",2118117,Nine," Not happen!
",1318118,Fry," ""Must let occur.""
",1918119,Nine," Let me tell you a story. A story of two alien species so ancient that compared to them the human race is a mere college senior! On a distant planetoid they evolved to cooperate in their quest to survive.
",20518120,Fry," Cooperation, because life is a team sport.
",4418121,Nine," But, over time, one species evolved a better strategy, and an evolutionary arms race began.
",9318122,Nine," That concludes the audio-visual portion of our head-clonk and lecture.
",7218123,Fry," Wait, what happened to the snakes and the frogs? I need to know!
",6618124,Nine,"  The frogs, or possibly the snakes, evolved into vicious killing machines, honed by the merciless forces of natural selection and intelligent design. We call these the Dark Ones!
",18018125,Nine," Meanwhile, however, the second species evolved to fend off the Dark Ones, befriending and protecting all other living things.
",12718126,Fry," Even Celine Dion?
",1918127,Nine," Probably. We call these noble beings the Encyclopods, because their DNA incorporates the DNA of every endangered species they encountered, so they can recreate them if they go extinct.
",18618128,Fry," Just as a pillow, a wig and a corncob pipe can be used to recreate my old girlfriend!
",8718129,Nine," Bingo.
",818130,Transition Announcer #1," Meanwhile, at the Honeybun Hideout.
",3718131,Labarbara," Now you know how it feels to be locked up in a go-go cage.
",6018132,Hermes," What the hell are you talking about?
",3818133,Labarbara," Shut your man-hole.
",2118134,Hermes," I feel dirty.
",1518135,Leela," Are you sure Fry is working for your father? It just doesn't seem like him to be so evil, or to hold down a job.
",11418136,Amy," It's true, Leela. Cross My Heart bra and swear to Goddess.
",6018137,Leela," But the Fry I know wouldn't do that. I'm gonna call his cell phone telephone and prove you wrong.   Oh, no! Frida's been murdered!
",13218138,Labarbara," Sweet she-cattle of Seattle.
",3018139,Hermes," Not your strong suit, woman.
",3018140,Amy," Who could have done this?
",2718141,Leela," Your dad? Nixon?
",1818142,Amy," Fry?
",618143,Leela," No, never. I don't think. Anyhow, there's a crazed murderer on the loose, possibly in the shadows or hanging from the ceiling.  So just stay calm while I call Fry.
",16518144,Fry," So where are the Encyclopods and the Dark Ones now?
",5318145,Nine," Wh-...  When the life-giving Chee receded, only the toughest organisms could adapt and survive, like the Dark Ones.  Many more died out, like the Encyclopods. But, and this is the great secret of our age, we believe they left an egg behind.
",24218146,Fry," Is it edible?
",1518147,Nine," We're not gonna eat it! Not unless we find a second one. No, Fry, we intend to hatch it!
",9018148,Hutch Waterfall," And that's where you come in.
",3118149,Fry," And here I am.
",1618150,Nine," At long last the tide of Chee has returned, and its nourishing flow has awakened the dormant egg.
",9918151,Fry," That's good.
",1418152,Hutch Waterfall," It's better than good. It's better. With its massive stash of DNA, the Encyclopod can reconstruct every species that ever went extinct.
",13718153,Fry," So, where is this egg?
",2418154,Nine," In the violet dwarf star system.
",3418155,Fry," And what does it look like?
",2918156,Nine," A violet dwarf star!
",2218157,Fry," You mean, the whole star is a single... Whoa! Sci-fi.
",5518158,Nine," Alas! Even now, a Dark One is headed to the star to ensure its destruction.
",7718159,Fry," Dang! So what does this Dark One look like?
",4518160,Nine,"  We don't know. I admit it's a horrifically grave situation.
",6218161,Hutch Waterfall," Don't sugarcoat it, Nine. The Dark Ones have been evolving so long, it could be anything or anyone. Or anybody.
",11318162,Fry," You mean, like, people?
",2518163,Hutch Waterfall," Any people. It will kill the egg, and every dude, woman and child who knows about it.
",8718164,Nine," Even our crazy caps will be useless at close range. That's why only you, with your defective unreadable brainwave, may be able to thwart them and usher in a new green age of wonder and...
",18918165,Fry," You're on Fry-time. Leela! Did you get my message?
",5218166,Leela," What message?
",1518167,Fry," Didn't you see Frida Waterfall?
",3318168,Leela," So you did kill Frida Waterfall?
",3418169,Fry," What? No. I told her to tell you that I'm... Oh, Jeep! The Dark Ones got her. It's all true. We need to talk, Leela. Then I can explain...  Well, I can't explain anything, but we should talk anyway. Where are you?
",21518170,Leela," Oh, no. I'm not gonna expose the Honeybun Hideout. Where are you?
",6718171,Fry," Near the Keeler Crater on Mars. Do you know it?
",4918172,Leela," I, I, uh... I think I read about it.
",3818173,Leela,"  I'll meet you at the south rim in one hour. No moustaches.
",6118174,Zapp," Kif, set coordinates, 36-24-36. AKA, Leela.
",4518175,Fry," Ten minutes late. Ain't that just like a womanista?
",5318176,Leela," Psst. Are you alone?
",2218177,Fry," Of course, don't you trust me?
",3218178,Zapp," There's no escape, Leela. If you surrender, wave your shirt in the air.
",7318179,Leela," Fry, you traitor!
",1918180,Amy," Hop onto the magnet, Leela!
",2918181,Leela," Okay. One, two... 
",2018182,Leela,"  I can't believe you ratted me out, Fry.
",4218183,Fry," I'm not a rat, I swear. If I'm any rodent, it's the loyal capybara, king of the rats! No, wait.
",9718184,Amy," Stay strong, ladies. We can lose them in the giant miniature golf course.
",7518185,Fry," But the course isn't finished. And there's no girls allowed.
",6218186,Amy," Fore! 
",818187,Zapp," So, they want to play mini golf, eh? Two can play at that game. Or even four, depending on the number of ball colors available.
",12918188,Zapp," I choose pink.
",1618189,Kif," That's their color, sir.
",2618190,Zapp," The hell it is.
",1718191,Leela," They're gaining on us. We need a birdie on the windmill hole.
",6318192,Amy," Wait. Wait. Drop the boot!
",2818193,Kif," Sir, at our present speed, the computer predicts a 100% chance we'll be sliced in half. We'll never make it.
",11018194,Zapp," Not with that attitude, we won't. Same speed ahead!
",5318195,Zapp," We made it through, Kif. How many men did we lose?
",5218196,Kif," All of them.
",1418197,Zapp," Well, at least they won't have to mourn each other. Seal the airlocks, and draw the shades. Resume shooting.
",11018198,Fry," Oh, no! The gorilla! That's a par-four!
",4118199,Leela," The mouth's too dangerous. I'm going for the nose.
",5218200,Amy," Don't be a sucker. You won't come out anywhere near the hole. You need to aim for the jaws just when they start to close.
",12318201,Leela," Start to close? Are you out of your...
",4018202,Leela," We made it!
",1318203,Zapp," Captaining 101 . Go for the nose.
",3518204,Bender," My arms are broken, I'll never paint again. 
",4618205,Kif," You can't sue the military.
",2918206,Bender," I'm okay then.
",1618207,Zapp," Damage report.
",1618208,Kif," We lost all remaining food and oxygen, Captain. As well as our XM Radio antenna.
",8218209,Zapp," Then this chase is over. Kif, set course for the nearest XM repair facility. Meanwhile, we shall sing top hits from the '80s.
",12718210,Kif," Which '80s, sir?
",1818211,Zapp," For me, there are only one '80s.  : Smell like I sound,  I'm lost and I'm found. And I'm hungry like the wolf.
",11218212,Hermes," The shot was too good! We're jamming straight for the hole.
",6118213,Zoidberg," We're gonna crash, even.
",2618214,Amy," Shmeesh, shmill out, shmeverybody. It's a wormhole hole.
",5818215,Farnsworth," Of course, a wormhole! We'll simply disappear and reappear in a...  ...nother part of the universe.
",10118216,Amy," We made it!
",1318217,Farnsworth," Uh, whaa...
",1318218,Leela," Crud nuggets! We de-spaced right next to the Nimbus.
",5418219,Zoidberg," Just when you think the chase is over, it gets twice as exciting!
",6718220,Bender," Hey, look at that.
",2018221,Zapp," Well, well, well. My bloodhound-like instincts must have hunted them down while my other parts were throbbing to Duran Duran.
",12718222,Kif," Shall I initiate a pointless and potentially fatal pursuit?
",6118223,Zapp," Make it so.
",1318224,Bender," It's gonna be fun on a bun, in space.
",3918225,Leela," Look! The asteroid. Now it's crawling with life. Like Zoidberg's sandals!
",7518226,Fry," Wow! It's incredible.
",2318227,Leela," But it'll be destroyed when Leo Wong blows up the violet dwarf. So why are you helping him?
",9318228,Fry," I can't tell you, Leela. You just have to trust me.
",5318229,Leela," You keep saying that, but you have to give me something to go on or I...
",7418230,Planet Express Ship Alarm," Out of whale oil. Out of whale oil.
",3718231,Leela,"  The out-of-fuel indicator. It's indicating.
",4618232,Zoidberg," Say, what's that violet-colored dwarf-like star thing we're drifting into?
",7618233,Leela," The violet dwarf star!
",2418234,Fry," Of course. The gorilla was the 18th hole, so we're headed into the ball return.
",8118235,Zoidberg," Aye, what else now can go wrong?
",3418236,Zapp,"  Ladies, you're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded again and again.
",7018237,Petunia," He'll never take me alive. 
",2918238,Leela," Don't give up yet. I've got one more trick up my sleeve.
",5818239,Amy," That's exactly the number we need.
",3618240,Zapp," Ah, the fairer sex.
",2118241,Zapp," Something's very wrong here, and yet a little bit right.
",5818242,Leela," Not so fast, Brannigan. 
",2618243,Bender," Even less fast, feministas! 
",3018244,Leela," Bender?
",918245,Bender," All two tons of me, and if you think that's shocking; wait 'til you see w...
",7818246,Transition Announcer #1," Tune in next time on Futurama! 
",3318247,Fry," Previously, on Futurama.
",2618248,Hutch Waterfall," Truth is, you're a mind reader.
",3318249,Fry," Oh, my God!
",1318250,Leela," Leeches may not be cuddly like pandas or tribbles, but these poor endangered creatures deserve... 
",10018251,Nine," You must gain Wong's confidence, infiltrate his organization and prevent him from destroying the violet dwarf. 
",11318252,Hutch Waterfall," The fate of the universe depends on you.
",4218253,Fry," Yeah, I get that a lot.
",2518254,Leela," It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
",5018255,Fry," Except in Kansas.
",1918256,Leo," I smell sabotage.
",1918257,Leela," Feministas unite! 
",2018258,Leela," Not so fast, Brannigan. 
",2618259,Bender," Even less fast, feministas! 
",3018260,Bailiff," Oye, oye, oye. All rise for the honorable Chief Justice D-O-G-G and the Associate Justices.
",9318261,Snoop Doggs," Yo. Seat it or beat it. The charges against y'all femditos is murder, mayhem, vandalism, kidnapping and resisting arrest. Damn! The big five. You may now make your opening ""what you got to say for yourselves.""
",21118262,Leela," May it please the Court...  I mean, may it plizzle the cozizzle.
",6618263,Dogg," Proceed.
",1018264,Leela," These charges are outrageous. Our only goal was to save a rare violet star and its precious ecosystem. If protecting the environment is a crime, then...
",15418265,Judge #1 Dogg," Protecting the environment is a crime.
",4018266,Leela,"  I rest my mouth.
",1918267,Bailiff," Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
",6518268,Nixon," I... Well, now, I... Am I under oath when I take the oath?
",6018269,Ruth Bader Ginsburg," Can the witness identify the feminista leader?
",4818270,Bender," That's her right there, with the ""I'm gonna kill you Bender"" look in her eye.
",7918271,Antonin Scalias head," Hey, aren't you the robot who robbed me at gunpoint last year?
",6418272,Bender," No further answers, Your Honor.
",3318273,Fry," Please, Justice Dogg, Leela and her friends are completely innocent.
",7018274,Dogg," Hold up. Were you or were you not abducted by these hoes?
",5918275,Fry," Well, abducted is such an ugly word.
",3818276,Clarence Thomas head," Mr. Wong, the court cannot compel you to testify against your own daughter.
",7718277,Leo," No. No, I want to. Also, I got something to say about my wife.
",6418278,Dogg," Aw, yeah. Having heard some of the testimony over these jams I've been listening to, me and my crew will now kick it in the mix.
",13018279,Dogg," A'ight. We got us a verdict up in this High Court. Bailiff, drop it like it's legal precedent.
",9618280,Bailiff," In the matter of Leo Wong v. The Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, four justices vote to convict, five to acquit.
",11718281,Scalia," However, since the vote was strictly along gender lines and the female justices' votes only count half, you are hereby found guilty.
",13418282,Ginsburg," It's a humiliating and biased system, but it works.
",5318283,Dogg," Fifty years in the maximum security Dogg house. 
",5018284,Warden," Ladies! Welcome to hell.
",2618285,Petunia," Beats Nutley on a Saturday night.
",3518286,Warden," This is a privately-owned for-profit prison and I run a tight, cheap ship! I've done this by cutting cost everywhere, especially on punishment. I rely on you inmates to make prison unpleasant for yourselves. You're encouraged to sexually harass new prisoners, organize no-holds-barred catfights and maintain poor hygiene.
",32318287,Amy," Try and make me, copper.
",2618288,Warden," Oh... a troublemaker.  Taste the lash of my 99-cent-store nightstick!
",7118289,Leo," Yee-ha! With the feministas in jail, it full speed ahead. You and me, Fry. We implode the violet dwarf star tomorrow. Ka-boom-boom.
",13318290,Fry," You and me?
",1318291,Leo," Yeah.
",718292,Fry," Tomorrow?
",1118293,Leo," Tomorrow.
",1118294,Fry," Ka-boom?
",1018295,Leo," Ka-boom-boom.
",1518296,Fry," Hello? Madfellows? I need to-  Okay, Leo Wong's about to destroy the violet dwarf. So, whatever I need to know to stop him, tell me now.
",13818297,Nine," Alas! Stopping Wong isn't the only problem. One of the Dark Ones will try to stop you from stopping him. So, you must stop it from stopping you from stopping him.
",16418298,Fry," But how can I stop it stop me stop him?
",4118299,Nine," Stop it! Behold, the Omega Device.
",3618300,Fry," That's it?
",1218301,Nine," The important thing is what's inside.
",3918302,Fry," What does that look like?
",2718303,Hutch Waterfall," No one knows, man. It was invented by a blind inventor, and the one dude he described it to was deaf.
",10318304,Mad Fellow," So the legend goes.
",2118305,Nine," When activated, the device will emit a localized blast of delta-band noise to momentarily disable the Dark One.
",11318306,Fry," But the Dark One could look like anything or anyone, right?
",6118307,Hutch Waterfall," Or anywhere.
",1418308,Fry," So, what's your plan to recognize it?
",3918309,Nine," We don't have one.
",2018310,Fry," Got it.
",918311,Hutch Waterfall," And we don't dare think of one neither. 'Cause if we do, the Dark Ones might sense kind of the general vibe. Even through our mighty foil.  Oh, man! Anyone got some tape or some gum?
",18418312,Nine," As my colleague indicated, the plan cannot come from us, Fry. We were counting on you and your unreadable brain to come up with something.
",14018313,Fry," That was a mistake.
",2118314,Nine," I see that now.
",1718315,Hutch Waterfall," Freaky thing is, the Dark Ones' thoughts are unreadable, just like yours.
",7518316,Nine," Yes, if we dared unwrap our heads, we could easily locate the one other being whose mind we can't read. The Dark One!
",11918317,Hutch Waterfall," But then the Dark One would read our minds and crush them like blood pumpkins.
",8018318,Fry," Wait. I can read minds and my mind can't be read. I have a plan.
",6618319,Nine," Great. Whatever it is, don't tell us.
",3918320,Hutch Waterfall," Wait. Fry can read minds and his mind can't be read. So he can safely scan for the Dark One...
",9618321,Nine," Shut up! Shut up!
",1918322,Hutch Waterfall," ...whose mind can't be read...
",3218323,Mysterious Voice," Leela, time is running out. We must get to the violet star.
",6118324,Leela," Okay, okay. Shut up, already.
",3118325,Dixie," Nobody's talking, Leela.
",2618326,Trixie," We're just painting each other's toenails with rat blood.
",5918327,Linda," We now go live to Leela with the escape plan. Leela?
",5418328,Leela," Thanks, Linda. Now we're in here because we tried to save endangered wildlife. So this time, endangered wildlife will save us.
",12818329,Amy," The Martian muck leech.
",2518330,Leela,"  Little cutie almost sucked me dry.
",3718331,Labarbara," Look at him go. Like a green snake through a sugarcane cake.
",6218332,Hermes," Keep trying.
",1418333,Morbo," Our top story. The universe's most wanted eco-feminists are now behind bars, including gang leader, Turanga Leela. AKA, the Notorious B-I-Itch.
",14518334,Zoidberg," We finished un-pinking the ship, Hubert. Now what?
",5218335,Farnsworth," Now we get back to work. And if that means destroying an ecosystem or two, so be it.
",8618336,Zoidberg," I just meant without our good friends Fry, Leela, Amy and the robut.
",7018337,Farnsworth," Oh, boo-hoo.
",1418338,Scruffy," Life goes on. But I believe we'll forever carry the pain on the inside.
",7318339,Amy," Oh, no, a rooster! That indicates it's the following morning.
",6318340,Labarbara," How's that creepy crawler doing?
",3418341,Leela," I'm sorry, femi-sisters, but it pooped out around 3:00 a.m. Poor thing couldn't take another bite.
",10018342,Amy," Well, I guess we failed. But what matters is, we tried our best and we looked good doing it.
",9418343,Amy," Bender?
",918344,Bender," Who does it look like? My identical cousin Buster?
",5218345,Amy," Yes.
",618346,Leela," You're here to break us out? But you're the one who put us in.
",6418347,Bender," But I'm Bender, king of the combination shot. I put you in so that by busting you out, I could commit 15 felonies at once. Puttin' my rap sheet miles ahead of yours on the all-time chart.
",18918348,Leela," You are one devious bastard.
",3018349,Bender," That's what it says on my vanity plate. 
",4218350,Leela," What about the sentries?
",2618351,Leela," Okay, Plan B. Everyone knows men have one fatal weakness - they can't resist hookers. Dixie, Trixie, you know what to do.
",12318352,Bender,"  Hello, boys!  Your eyes say no, but your machine gun fire says- 
",6718353,Leo," Ladies and gentleman and whatever, welcome to my most environmentally disastrous implosion ever. A whole star system!
",11918354,Zapp," Kif, old boy, mind if I sit on your shoulders for a better view?
",6618355,Kif," Well, actually, sir, I was hoping...
",3818356,Leo," My associate Philip Fry here will have honor to blow this ugly, dirty star into nice, clean black hole.
",10518357,Leo," Fry, what you doing down there?
",3318358,Fry,"  Just polishing your shoes, Mr. W.
",3618359,Leo," Mmm, that nice. Get between the toes there, very dirty.
",5718360,Bender," Well, so much for Plan B.
",2718361,Leela," What's Plan C?
",1618362,Bender," All situations have the same Plan C. Bending, come on.
",5618363,Leela," We're boned, Bender. It's a brick wall.
",4118364,Bender," Granted, it's not on the list of approved bendables, but I'm so great!
",7218365,Amy," Dogs! The boning continues.
",2918366,Bender,"  Green Bluebird, this is Mr. Fabulous. We are go for cheesing it.
",6718367,Leela,"  Professor! Hermes! Zoidberg!  Uh...
",3818368,Scruffy," Scruffy. The janitor.
",2318369,Leela," You helped us escape? Even after we locked you in a go-go cage like common go-go dancers?
",9118370,Farnsworth," I couldn't live with myself, Leela. I call myself a scientist, wear the white coat and probe a monkey every now and again, yet I put monetary gain ahead of preserving nature. Can you ever forgive me?
",20118371,Scruffy," I reckon.
",1118372,Leela," I could kiss you, Professor.
",3018373,Farnsworth," Okay, but watch out for my new grill. 
",4018374,Zapp," Before the grand finally  , as it were, it seems only fitting that I, Commodore 64 Zapp Brannigan, say a few brief pages in honor of...
",13718375,Nine," Whatever your plan is, Fry, I suggest you get on with it. Get... Shoot, I got hot sauce on my Number 9 shirt.
",11118376,Fry," Okay, locate the Dark One by finding someone whose thoughts I can't read.
",7518377,Zapp," And unaccustomed...
",2118378,Zapp," By God! I'm the greatest speaker of all time. They're suckling at the teats of my every syllable.
",9918379,Zapp," Allow me now...
",1718380,Kif," His voice is like ear sandpaper.I miss Amy.
",4518381,Mom,"  If I had all the money in the world, I'd... Oh, wait. I do. 
",6318382,Calculon," I'd like to thank the academy, my agent, and most of all, my operating system, Windows 7, for everything it... System error.
",12618383,Snoop Dogg," Naked ladies. Naked ladies. Naked ladies. Naked ladies.
",5718384,Leo," I never should have taken that accent elimination class from Jackie Chan.
",7518385,Zapp," And so, as we obliterize this star, let us remember those immortal words once spoken by a great man, moi. And I quote, ""All good things must come to an end, preferably in a humongous explosion.""
",19618386,Leo," Let's pop this beach ball.
",2818387,All," Ten! Nine! Eight!
",1918388,Fry," There's no one here whose thoughts can't be read. No one, except me! My thoughts can't be read. But, but that's crazy. If I were the Dark One, I'd know it, wouldn't I? But, here I am, right where the Dark One would be, about to blow up the star. Oh, God! Somewhere deep inside of me, it's me! I'm the Dark One!
",31218389,All," Two... one!
",1318390,Leela," Put your hands in the air!
",2818391,Snoop Dogg," Should we wave them like we just don't care?
",4618392,Leela," That's optional.
",1818393,Leo," You girl punks gone too far this time. Your parents should be ashamed.
",7218394,Amy," Yes, you should!
",1818395,Kif," Amy!
",618396,Mysterious Voice," Destroy the star, Leo, hurry.
",3118397,Leo," You got it, Mr. Voice-in-my-head.  I've gotta admit, Amy, you got a pretty good swing.
",8818398,Amy," Really? Thanks, Dad.
",2218399,Leela," Okay, time to defuse this star cracker once and for all. 
",5918400,Fry," Leela, wait. You're making a mistake. You have no idea what's really going on.
",8018401,Leela," What is really going on?
",2618402,Fry," I can't tell you.
",1918403,Leela," Then why should I trust you? Why?
",3518404,Fry," Because... Because...
",2318405,Leela," You're you. That's all I need to know.
",4018406,Bender," No! Don't do it!
",1818407,Scruffy," Fiddlesticks.
",1518408,Amy," Leela, are you crazy? We became fugitives and jail-breakers to stop him.
",7418409,Bender," And hookers, don't forget hookers.
",3618410,Leela," Shame on all of you. After everything we've been through together, do you really think Fry would-
",9918411,Fry," Goodbye, Leela. I destroy myself to save you.
",4718412,Nixons Head," Where's the boom? I was expecting a boom.
",4318413,Fry," It didn't work. I'm the Dark One, and it didn't do anything. 
",6318414,Mysterious Voice,"  You're not the Dark One, I am.
",3318415,Fry," Leela?
",818416,Mysterious Voice," Not Leela, you moron. Me!  What did you do to me?
",5118417,Leela," Ew!
",518418,Dark One," I am the Dark One. The very last Dark One. How is it possible I couldn't read your mind? Oh, I am momentarily disabled.
",12118419,Randy,"  What's happening out there?
",3018420,Sal," Somethings wondersful.
",2418421,Leela," The star and the asteroid. They were an egg and a sperm.
",5818422,Preacherbot," Great modem of mercy. Cover the children's eyes.
",5018423,Morbo," There are no children here.
",2918424,Preacherbot," Then move your fat head. I can't see.
",3918425,Nine," The Encyclopod is reborn. A new green age has begun!
",5418426,Mad Fellow," So the legend foretold.
",2518427,Farnsworth," Look! Inside its pouch. Extinct Tasmanian tigers.
",5118428,Amy," And dodo birds.
",1718429,Leela," And white rhinos.
",1918430,Hermes," And striped biologist-taunters.
",3318431,Striped biologist-taunter," What are you gonna do, shoot us?
",3418432,Encyclopod," Life!  These once extinct plants and animals are my gift to the universe. Through untold generations, my race has treasured their DNA. Treat them wisely with the knowledge that all species are precious.
",20418433,Leela," This is unbelievable. What's going on?
",4018434,Hutch Waterfall," To answer that, I must tell you a story. A story of two alien species so ancient that-
",8818435,Fry," Hutch, are you okay?
",2218436,Hutch Waterfall," My sister's femi-necklace. 
",2918437,Fry," What?   Hey, how come I can't read your thoughts anymore?
",5918438,Encyclopod," I shall avenge you, Hutch Waterfall.
",3818439,Nine," After all these eons, the Dark Ones are no more. Will you preserve their DNA, O' Great Encyclopod?
",10018440,Encyclopod," I suppose I should. Wait, where did it go?
",4418441,Zoidberg," What?
",718442,Encyclopod," Well, at any rate, I shall preserve the DNA of Homo sapiens.
",6218443,Fry," Huh. I thought you only saved the DNA of endangered species.
",6218444,Encyclopod," Farewell. 
",1218445,Fry," I guess he didn't hear me.
",2818446,Bender," Well, looks like that wraps everything up in a nice big, old, fat sack of...
",7818447,Zapp," I hereby arrest you fugitives on 53 counts of fugivity. Kif, round them up, and spare me the weary sigh for once.  Kif?
",12118448,Kif,"  Wait for me.
",1518449,Fry," Well, this is the end. There was so many things I wanted to say to you.
",7318450,Leela," Like what?
",1218451,Fry," Like this is not the end. But mostly just, I love you, Leela.
",6318452,Leela," Maybe I waited too long to say this, but I love you, too- wormhole!
",6918453,Hermes," Sweet topology of cosmology, it's huge!
",4118454,Farnsworth," If we fly into it, it could take us trillions of light years away. There's no knowing if we'll ever return.
",10918455,Fry," What do we do? Should we go for it?
",3718456,Bender," Into the breach, meatbags. Or not. Whatever. 
",4718457,All," Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
",4118458,Bender,"  On the count of three, you will awaken feeling refreshed, as if Futurama had never been cancelled by idiots, then brought back by bigger idiots. 1... 2... .
",15918459,Bender,"  This has been a test of the Emergency Hypnotoad System.  Had this been an actual hypnosis, you would go limp and watch whatever crap comes on next.  Comin' up next: Futurama! 
",17818460,Fry," Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy.
",3718461,Farnsworth," OK.
",518462,Fry," That's all. 
Â  Oh, also; I'm covered with severe burns.
",5718463,Farnsworth," So!?  What of it?
",1918464,Fry," Well, why isâ€“ those things?
",2918465,Farnsworth," You mean you don't remember?
",3018466,Fry," Nope, nothing. It's like when I passed out in college, except no one drew magic marker penises on my forehead.
",11218467,Farnsworth," Well, I suppose it's for the best, considering the unbearable horrors you've endured. Let's never speak of it again.
Â  It all began a few days ago. We were interstellar fugitives on the run from the law.
",20518468,Zapp," Fire all weapons and open a hailing frequency for my victory yodel.
",6918469,Farnsworth,"  And so, as you and Leela kissed goodbye in a tender display of toungesmanship, we plunged into a massive wormhole. Never to be seen again.
",14118470,Bender," Yeah, we're back.
",1918471,Hermes," Sweet coincidence of Port-au-Prince, we're back at Earth!
",5918472,Farnsworth," Of course, that was the Panama Wormhole, Earth's central channel for shipping!
",8018473,Zoidberg," How humorous.
",1518474,Farnsworth," Yes! It's sort of a Comedy Central channel, and we're on it now!
",6618475,Amy," I get it!
",1118476,Fry," We've lost power to the forward Game Boy, Mario not responding!
",6518477,Leela," Brace for emergency landing!
",3018478,Farnsworth," Rodger that, activate Safety Spheres!  Also mine has air conditioning.
",7218479,Farnsworth," Yet, thanks to my trusty safety sphere, I surblibed with only tribial bray dablage.
",8518480,Fry," And the others?
",1718481,Farnsworth," Right here behind this horror cloth.
",3818482,Fry," Are they dead?
",1618483,Farnsworth," Oh, no no no, much worse.
",2718484,Farnsworth," Move over God! Prepare for rebirth!  Wrong switch. 
",5318485,Farnsworth," Come on, stem cells. Work your astounding scientific nonsense!
",6418486,Fry," Fetal steam cells? Aren't those controversial?
",4818487,Farnsworth," In your time yes, but nowadays, shut up! Besides, these are adult stem cells harvested from perfectly healthy adults, whom I killed for their stem cells.
",15518488,Fry," Hermes Conrad!
",1618489,Hermes,"  Oh, mon! I'm dripping with placenta! Good thing it's Casual Friday.
",7018490,Fry," Amy Wong!
",1118491,Amy," Oh, baby soft!
",1618492,Farnsworth,"  Indeed.
Hermes: Dr. Zoidberg!
",3218493,Zoidberg," Hermes, my friend! Let me cut off your umbilical cord.  Oops.
",6318494,Fry," And the rest!
",1518495,Amy," Hooray, we're back in business!
",3318496,Zapp," Over my dead body.  Uh, never mind.
",3718497,Fry,"  Bender! Are the steam cells working? 
",4018498,Bender,"  I'm dying. I need mouth to ass resuscitation.
",4818499,Fry," I'm on it!  It's not working!
",3118500,Bender,"  I die happy knowing you fell for that.
",4118501,Farnsworth," His power supply is shot! He is flatlining!  Only one thing can keep him alive.  Possibly this thing. 
",10418502,Bender," Woo! I've never felt so energetic! 
",3718503,Farnsworth," That's because the doomsday device I shoved all up in you puts out 50 gigawatts. That's ten times your recommended--
",11818504,Bender," Who are you? My warranty? 
",2818505,Farnsworth," For God's sake, Bender! Keep dancing, keep whooping it up!  You must burn off the doomsday energy as fast as it produces, or it will build to critical levels.
",16018506,Bender," You don't mean...
",1918507,Farnsworth," Oh, but I do. If you stop partying for a single second, you'll explode and kill everyone here in a fireball of melting gears and splattered bowels.
",14918508,Bender," Sounds like a party, baby! 
",2918509,Fry," Hey! Speaking of splattered bowels, can I cook you a romantic dinner tonight, Leela?... Where's Leela?  Is she okay? Why hasn't she acknowledged my dinner offer?
",16318510,Farnsworth," Something's wrong! She's not responding to my poking stick. 
",6218511,Fry," Poke harder, damn it!
",2318512,Farnsworth," I'm poking as hard as I can! I'm sorry, Fry,  but I'm afraid Leela is in an irreversible coma.
",9618513,Bender,"  Coma, coma, coma, coma, coma, chameleon!
",4318514,Fry," My soul mate is gone. Why should I go on living?
",5018515,Bender," Because the pain slowly fades but the love is forever. 
",5718516,Fry," But, what if I forget the sweet sound of her voice or the moist touch of her eyeball on my lips?
",9818517,Bender," Aw! Are you still hung up on Whatshername? Move on already!
",6118518,Fry," Maybe you're right.
",2118519,Bender," Maybe I'm always right.
",2518520,Fry," Build-A-Bot Workshop? It's time to start living again!
",5618521,Fry," At least it's something to distract me from Leela.  Nah.  Now that I like for some reason.
",9218522,Robot #1 Leela,"  I like jellybeans. Do you?
",2918523,Fry," I sure do, honey.
",1918524,Farnsworth," Come now, Fry!  You can't live out this sick fantasy!  Not without our help.
",7818525,Hermes," These security tapes record everything at Planet Express. Including the ship, shower, and urinals.
Amy: And yet, it still hasn't stopped the elusive bathroom burglar.
",16818526,Zoidberg,"  Maybe he's just trying to feed his family. 
",4618527,Hermes," Computer, analyze tapes and extract personality profile of one Turanga Leela.
",7918528,Computer," Analyzing...analyzing...Checking my eBay bid.  Dammit. Analysis complete.
",7518529,Fry," Hey, I was nuzzling that!
Computer: Attributes transferred...Shoe size 12...etc.
",8218530,Robot #1 Leela," Brace for emergency landing! What? We survived the crash? Oh, Fry! 
",6918531,Bender," Party people in the house say, 
",3318532,Robot #1 Leela," This is wonderful! The last thing I remember I was dying in an explosion. Yet here I am in the flesh more alive than ever!
",12418533,Fry," Alive? 
",918534,Hermes," You better tell her, Fry.
",2718535,Robot #1 Leela," Tell me what?
",1518536,Hermes," Anyway, my work is done. I'm gonna hit the showers.
",5318537,Robot #1 Leela," Nibbler, come give mama a hug!  Ow! What theâ€”?! Bad Nibbler! Bad Nibbler!  What are you doing, pooperdoodle? It's me, Leela.
Robot Leela: Am I really just a robot? I mean, I have Leela's memories!  Her opinion of gazelles!   Her emotions! 
",24118538,Fry," I swear.  I didn't know this would happen.  The only thing I truly know is I love you.  I mean herâ€”Wait, help me out here.
",12418539,Bender," Do the Bender! Do the Bender!
",3118540,Randy," No thank you.
",1518541,Bender,"  I said, ""Do it!""
Robot Leela: The truth is, Fry, I still have feelings for you.  But are they really my feelings? Am I just an automaton or can a machine of sufficient complexity legitimately achieve consciousness?
",21718542,Fry," I agree.
",1018543,Robot #1 Leela," I need some time to figure this out.  Until then,  friends?
",6118544,Fry,"  Okay.
",818545,Bender," Listen up, disco dummies, you just flunked outta Bender's College for Party Knowledge!
",8818546,Bender," Do the back dance! Do the back dance! Ooh....
",4718547,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone...
Farnsworth : I'm going to make one final attempt to awaken Leela.  After all, there's always hope.
",12318548,Fry," Really?
",918549,Farnsworth,"  No, don't get your hopes up. Frankly, she's just a brainless mound of scabs and pus.
",8718550,Fry,"  Oh! I didn't need to hear that.
",3418551,Farnsworth," No, and you don't need to see this.
",3718552,Machine," Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
",4618553,Machine," Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!!!! WAKE UP!!!!!!!!!!!
",5918554,Farnsworth," Well, that's it. I'm afraid traditional medicine has failed.
",6218555,Fry," No!  I refuse to give up! Wake up, Leela!  I! Love! You!
",5818556,Robot #1 Leela," Fry, stop. She's gone.
",2418557,Farnsworth," Dr. Zoidberg, can you note the time and declare the patient legally dead?
",7518558,Zoidberg," Can I? That's my specialty.
",2918559,Hermes," As you all know, Leela's living will states that in the event of coma, her body is to be fed to the wild Cyclophage, a highly endangered creature that eats only cyclopses.
",17318560,Bender,"  Yep, that's what her donor card says. 
",4118561,Fry,"  Goodbye, my love. 
",2118562,Farnsworth," The beast aproacheth.
",2318563,Bender," To the beat y'all! To the beat y'all! I'm dancin' a jig wid ma feets y'all!
",7718564,Amy," Bender, cut it out! People are trying to have emotions!
",5718565,Bender," You think I wanna party?  I'm sick of partying!  Woohoo! More partying! 
",7418566,Leela," Bender, shut the hell up!
",2718567,Farnsworth," Bender, stop shutting the hell up!
",3618568,Bender," Oh, right.  Leela's back. As if I care. Woo.
",4618569,Leela," Thanks. It's so nice to wake up and seeâ€” 
",4318570,Fry," Leela?!
",918571,Robot #1 Leela," Leela?
",818572,Leela,"  Leela?
",918573,Hermes," Leela.
",818574,Leela,"  How is this possible? And can you believe she wore a tank top to my funeral?
",7918575,Robot #1 Leela," Shut up!  We gotta get outta here!
",3618576,Leela,"  No, you ""Shut up! We gotta get outta here!""
Bender: Ooh, yeah, baby, come on!
",8018577,Bender," All aboard the party ship!
Leela: There's no room for two captains' butts in this chair!
",9018578,Robot #1 Leela," There would be if you'd taken a spin class instead of lounging around in a coma!
",8218579,Leela," This is crazy.
",1618580,Leela," It's like I'm looking at an exact robot duplicate of myself.
",6218581,Farnsworth," That is what you're looking at.
",3318582,Leela," Oh.  How could you do this, Fry?
",3418583,Fry," Uh, coma. Sad.
",1618584,Robot #1 Leela," I have to go!  This is just too freaky! 
",4218585,Fry," Don't get upset, Leela.  She's nothing like you.
",5018586,Leela," I have to go!  This is just too freaky! 
",4218587,Fry," I need cheering up, Bender.  I dunno.  You wanna go out and party tonight?
",7618588,Bender,"  I hate partying!  If only I didn't have so much crunk in my badunkadunk!  Ooh, yeah! Come on, babe!
",10218589,Fry," Why does everything I date run away?  I love Leela, always and forever.  And if I loved Robot Leela, too...
",10918590,Fry," ...well, that's only 'cause she had so much of real Leela in her.  I thought she loved me, too, but, obviously, I was wrong as usual.
",13518591,Leela," Wrong again.  You were right.
",3118592,Fry," Leela?  Leela Leela?
",2218593,Leela," Leela Leela.  I've been thinking, Fry, if I lost you, I don't think I could stand it, either.  I'd probably build a copy of you, too.  As long as Robo-Leela's not a jealous type like me, thing will worâ€”
",20418594,Robot #1 Leela," I'll kill you, you slut-clops!  Hee-ya!  He's mine!
",5318595,Leela," Oh, back off, missy!
",2218596,Amy," Somebody do something!  Here, take this.
",4218597,Fry," A gun?!  D-Do I really need toâ€”?
",3418598,Leela," Shoot her!  She's the robot!
",3018599,Robot #1 Leela," No, shoot her!  She's the human!
",3418600,Fry," But-But how do I know who's the human and who's the robot?
",6018601,Leela," We just told you!
",1918602,Robot #1 Leela," Yeah, you idiot!
",1818603,Fry," Okay. Fine. If you're gonna be like that, I'm not shooting anyone.  Whoa! Right between the lungs. Man, that was close. 
",12218604,Fry," I'm a robot, too!
",1918605,Zoidberg,"  Aha!  That explains this growth on your drive shaft.
",5518606,Robot #1 Fry," But how is this possible?
",2718607,Farnsworth," Who knows?  Oh, I do.  Allow me to explain what really happened the day the ship crashed.
",9118608,Fry," I'll protect you, Leela!  My love is stronger than the vast majority of explosions!
",8518609,Farnsworth," Fry did in fact save Leela, though at a terrible cost to himself.  I tossed him into the stem cells but he just bubbled away like phlegm on a hot sidewalk.
Farnsworth : Leela was so upset, she went all Blade Runner and built a duplicate...
",24118610,Farnsworth," ...then uploaded his personality from the urinal surveillance tapes.
",7018611,Fry,"  I sure love Leela.
",2118612,Farnsworth," Alas, in recreating Fry's adorable jelly belly, she had overstuffed him with copper wadding.
",9418613,Farnsworth," The inevitable static discharged electrocuted Leela and destroyed both of their short-term memories.
",10218614,Robot #1 Fry," So that's why I'm so amazed by these things I already knew.
",6118615,Farnsworth," What could I do?  I hung up Leela with the other bone bags and went to procure the final ingredient for my stem cell brew.
",12418616,Robot #1 Fry," Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy.
",3718617,Leela," My god, I can't believe I'll never see that particular Fry again.
",6718618,Fry," Hey, where's my shoes?
",2418619,Robot #1 Fry," Fry!
",618620,Fry,"  Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was already here. Wait, what's with all the Leelas?
",8818621,Robot #1 Fry," Trust me, don't ask.
",2218622,Fry," Okay, dork. Listen, I'm gonna hit the urinal, maybe talk about myself a little bit, thenâ€”
",9118623,Robot #1 Leela," Hang on!  It's time to sort things out.  The truth is I love Fry.  That Fry.
",7818624,Robot #1 Fry," And I love Leela.  Any Leela.
",3118625,Robot #1 Leela," We're robots and we're in love. Let's ditch these meat jackets.
",6518626,Robot #1 Fry," Whoa, cool!
",1318627,Robot #1 Fry,"  Hasta la vista, wiener!
",2618628,Robot #1 Leela,"  We'll be back...for our stuff.
",3318629,Amy," Why did their voices change?
",3018630,Farnsworth," That's the one thing we'll never truly understand.
",5218631,Fry," Uh, this is a bit awkward.  Or is it?
",3918632,Leela," I'm not sure. I lost track around the second robot.
",5318633,Fry," Well, you know how I feel.  I waited for you for a thousand years.  I can wait a little longer.
",9718634,Bender," Pffft!  What a load of mush!  I've had it!
",4418635,Amy," He's gonna blow!
",1818636,Farnsworth," Party, Bender!  Party for your life!
",3818637,Bender," No chance, hot pants!  I'd rather die and kill all of you than party for one more millisecond!
",9618638,Leela," The cyclops eater!
",2018639,Bender," Hold on, mac!  It ain't like that!
",3618640,Bender," Geez, what's it take to kill me?
",3418641,Farnsworth," Bender, you blew out your excess capacity!  You're cured!
",5918642,Bender,"  Oh, sweet mercy.  My hellish nightmare is over. I never have to party again.
",7918643,Fry," Well, that's that, then.  We're back, everyone!
",4918644,Bender," Party!!
",918645,Zapp," Wheeee!
",918646,Transition Announcer #1," And now, The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan!  Brought to you by Bartley's Rocket Wax.
",9718647,Zapp,"  I wax my rocket every day.
",2918648,Emperor Chop Chop," No one can save you now, Leela.
",3318649,LeelaActress," Well, what about Zapp Brannigan?
",3418650,Emperor Chop Chop," Well, obviously, Zapp Brannigan can save you, butâ€”  Zapp Brannigan!
",6918651,Zapp," So, Emperor Chop Chop, once again we meet at last! Drop that space gun or I'll shoot!  Like so! 
",9818652,LeelaActress," Oh, Zapp!  Tie me back up and ravish me!
",4218653,Zapp," I'd like to, Leela.  So I will.
",3318654,Zapp," Ooh, yeah, shake it, baby. Shake it likeâ€”   I surrender and volunteer for treason!
",8418655,Kif,"  Emergency summons from the President, captain.
",4918656,Zapp," Oh, it's you.  Just let me freshen up.  Computer, captain's musk.
",6718657,Zapp," The long dramatic corridor.  That's never a good sign.
",5618658,Scanner," Glove recognized. Proceed, Mrs. Eisenhower.
Zapp: Mr. President, what the hell?
",8118659,Nixon," At ease, Brannigan.
",2118660,Nixon," What you're about to see is highly classified. Reptillicus, hit the thingy.
",7718661,Nixon,"  At 0000 hours, Planet XXX was attacked by a mysterious death sphere. 
",7218662,Zapp,"  Magnify that death sphere.  Why's it still blurry?
",5318663,Kif," That's all the resolution we have. Making it bigger doesn't make it clearer.
",7818664,Zapp," It does on CSI: Miami.
",2418665,Nixon," They fought back with advance military hardware, but it was like shooting BB's at Bebe Rebozo.
",9618666,Zapp," That poor brave hardware.
",2718667,Nixon," The sphere then fired some kind of hellish blackout ray.  Erased that planet like eighteen minutes of incriminating tape.
",12318668,Zapp," Oh, I just wish I understood why.  Why I should care.
",5518669,Nixon," Because the death sphere is now on course for Earth! Rowrowooooooo!!
",7018670,Zapp," My god, we're defenseless. Like fish in a barrel.
",5118671,Nixon," Options?
",1018672,Zapp," My instinct is to hide in this barrel.  Like the wily fish.
",6118673,Nixon,"  Then we're down to our last hope.  A radical new weapon built by a visionary scientist I once dismissed as crazy.
",11618674,Farnsworth," Let's see how crazy I am now, Nixon!  The correct answer is: very.
",6818675,Nixon," Alright, Professor. Sock it to me!
",3618676,Farnsworth," Top secret news, everyone! I've developed a tiny one-man stealth fighter that's virtually undetectable.
",10518677,Zapp,"  How undetectable?
",2018678,Farnsworth," It's right in front of you.
",2918679,Zapp,"  I find thatâ€”OW! â€”to believe.
",3118680,Bender," But how exactly is this Happy Meal toy gonna destroy a giant death sphere?
",7618681,Farnsworth," From within.  This ship should be able to sneak undetected through the sphere's one vulnerable opening.
",10518682,Hermes," What vulnerable opening?
",2618683,Farnsworth," All death spheres have one vulnerable opening.
",4818684,Zoidberg," Well, sure, but who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a ""death sphere""?
",9618685,NIxon," I say Brannigan.
",1818686,Zapp,"  I say no.
",1218687,Leela," I say me.
",1118688,Nixon," I say Leela.
",1418689,Leela," I say yes.
",1218690,Fry," I say no.
",1118691,Zapp," I say Leela, too.
",1918692,Leela," I say yes again.
",1818693,Zapp," I say I shall join her.
",2518694,Leela," But it's only a one-man craft...I say.
",4018695,Zapp," There'll only be one man.  Me.  How would you feel if I rode rear as your personal tail gunner?
",9718696,Leela," Creeped out.
",1418697,Zapp," Then it's decided.
",2018698,Leela,"  Are you sure I have to sit in your lap?
",4218699,Zapp," It'll help us achieve maximum thrust.
",3918700,Fry,"  I made you some trail mix for the flight.  Also this picture to remember me by.
",8218701,Leela," You hold on to it.  I'll be back soon.
",4018702,Farnsworth,"  Activate stealth shielding.
",3018703,Leela," Liftoff!
",1018704,Zapp," I'll rodger that.
",1918705,Fry," Did anyone else feel aroused and jealous and worried?
",5518706,Bender," I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.
",5918707,Leela," Death sphere in range.  Engaging holographic targeting.   Activating the Force.
",8118708,The Force,"  Feel the entrance, Leela. Destination on your left in...  zero point three  miles.
",8518709,Zapp," Zapp to Leela: look at all that surveillance equipment.
",5718710,Leela,"  We better whisper.
",2118711,Zapp," Switching to pillow talk mode.
",3218712,Leela," Look.  What are those huge letters?
",3718713,Zapp," ""V-GINY?"" Doesn't ring a bell.
",3218714,Farnsworth," Hmmm....
",1018715,Farnsworth," I don't like the looks of this ""V-GINY.""  Does anyone recognize those call letters?
",8518716,Hermes," Nope.  It's not in the Janeway's Guide either.
",4818717,Farnsworth," Deciphering that ID code is critical.  I'll be in the Chamber of Understanding.
",8118718,Leela," This is it! The moment we should've trained for!
",5018719,Leela," Holy crâ€”
",1018720,Zapp," Incoming yucky!
",1718721,Leela," Firing pocket rocket!
",2318722,Zapp," Don't panic, Leela! Go go go go go!
",3718723,Leela," I hope this is the control stick!
",3518724,Zapp," Captain's Log: We've lost control.  Addendum: Whoooaa-oooooaa-ooaaaah!!!
",7418725,Transition Announcer #1," And now, back to The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan!
",6418726,Zapp,"  Chapter Two: ""The Heat Thickens"".
",3618727,Zapp," Leela, wake up! I can't face this mysterious planet alone without you or someone like you.
",9218728,Leela," Zapp?  Zapp, wake up!
",2318729,Zapp," Leela? Where are we.
",2218730,Leela," We crashed on an uncharted planet.  When I woke up, I was pinned under this tree. Can you help me?
",10018731,Zapp,"  If anyone can move it, I can.  No one can move it. Are you hurt?
",6718732,Leela," No. But I'm so thirsty.  This spacesuit is making me sweat like a sow.
",7218733,Zapp," Me, too. We better strip them off and continue surviving au naturel.
",7018734,Leela," Uh, I suppose so.
",1918735,Zapp," Here.  We can cover ourselves with these sticky sap-covered leaves.  I'll try to avert my eyes from your nudery.
",11418736,Leela," You will?  Eh, what's the point? You'll have to look sooner or later.
",7118737,Zapp," Well, I promise not to abuse the privilege. For now, I better scout around for food and water and help.
",10518738,Leela," What a thoughtful and considerate thing to say.  What the hell's wrong with you?
",8218739,Zapp," I'm not quite sure. Perhaps it's the fresh air or a severe head injury.  In any case, I'm off.
",9618740,Leela,"  If you see any steaks, that'd be good!
",4118741,Fry," Why isn't Leela back yet?  Do you think she's okay?
",5318742,Bender," How should I know?  And how come you never ask if I'm okay?  I'm feelin' a little neglected here!
",9918743,Fry," Oh, sorry. Are you okay, Bender?
",3418744,Bender," Shut up!
",1018745,Hermes," What difference does it make?  When that death sphere gets to Earth, we'll all be blown to Manwich meat!
",10618746,Amy," Well, I guess it's time to indulge in some end-of-the-world debauchery.  Who's up for an orgy?
",9618747,Zoidberg," Maybe a Parcheesi tournament.
",3118748,Farnsworth," Belay that Parcheesi tournament! I've identified the death sphere! We may yet have a faint hope of survival!
",11018749,Zoidberg," Still, a Parcheesi tournament.
",3218750,Farnsworth," This is a top secret military satellite launched by the Air Force in 1998.
",7618751,Farnsworth," And this is a top secret FCC satellite launched that same year to censor indecent TV programs.
",9618752,Bender," Like The Pimpsons? And Assarama?
",3418753,Farnsworth," Precisely.  However, the satellites collided shortly after launch and were never heard from again.
",10018754,Zoidberg," I found the board!
",2018755,Farnsworth," Now, I've simulated that collision using Shrapnovision.
",5718756,Fry,"  Granted, all that makes perfect sense, but why is this death sphere destroying planets?
",9018757,Farnsworth," That makes the most sense of all.  Look at the planets it's destroyed so far.  First came XXX, the nude beach planet.  Then Poopiter.  â‚¬$!#%&"" comes on screen.] And finally that world that can't be mentioned in polite company.
",22818758,Fry," You mean...
",1318759,Amy," Aw!
",518760,Farnsworth," How dare you!?
",1618761,Amy," Shame onâ€”
",1118762,Hermes," So the death sphere is ""censoring"" indecent planets?
",5418763,Farnsworth," Indeed.  And we're next if we can't keep it in our collective pants!  Our sole hope is to persuade the people of Earth to abandon their smutty ways.
",15018764,Amy," So the orgy's off?
",2018765,Leela," So thirsty.  Why couldn't a water fountain have fallen on me?
",6318766,Zapp," I couldn't find any water.  But the moisture in these fruit and nut berries should sustain you.
",9718767,Leela," Thank you.  
",1418768,Zapp," I climbed perilously high into the trees to pick them, yet I saw no sign of intelligent life.
",9518769,Leela," Bummer.
",918770,Zapp," Moreover, the crash totally destroyed our ship.
",4918771,Leela," So we're stuck here until someone finds us?
",4518772,Zapp," Alas, that may never happen.  Stealth technology makes the ship impossible to locate yet easy to stub your crotch on.
",11918773,Leela," Well, there's worse places to be marooned.  Plenty of food, mild climate.
",7518774,Zapp," It's a veritable Garden of Eden.
",3418775,Leela," It is?
",818776,Snake," Hello.
",818777,Leela," Did that snake say, ""Hello""?
",3018778,Zapp," No, we're both delirious from dehydration.
",4418779,Snake," Just like Adam and Eve.
",2518780,Farnsworth," We can still save Earth.  People are sure to clean up their act when presented with cold hard facts by rational folks like us.
",12818781,Farnsworth," The end is near! Repent thy sins!
",3518782,Sal,"  I'll thinks it overs while I engages this five dollar hooker.
",6418783,Fry,"  Don't do it! It's not worth it!
",3418784,Petunia," Okay, make it three dollars.
",3018785,Sal," Yuck! I don't wants no three-dollar hooker.  I'm goin' backs to the adults bookstore.
",8718786,Fry," Adult bookstore?  I thought this was the public library.
",5818787,Bender,"  Nope, pubic library.
",2318788,Leela," Zapp?  Where are you?  Oh, God, I'm actually starting to miss him.
",6818789,Snake," Maybe you two belong together.
",3218790,Leela," We do not.  And you can't talk.
",3318791,Snake," Oh, come on!  It must be an awful temptation. 
Zapp: Guess who just killed a woodchuck with his bare feet?  I thought I'd whip us up some shelter, make this a little more like home.
",18318792,Leela," I do miss the Earth terribly.  I wonder if it's even still there.
",6718793,Zapp," Let's find out together.  I'll brave the ship's wreckage to fetch you the telescope. 
",8718794,Leela," That's so sweet.
",1818795,Snake," I'm just sayin' is all.
",2518796,Farnsworth," I know my new plan is a long shot, but it's the only hope left.
",6518797,Hermes," Well, now I've heard everything  on my eyePod.  So, do you have a new plan, Professor, and is there any hope left?
",11618798,Farnsworth," Indeed.  We're here on Earth's last unspoiled acre to show the death sphere there's still purity in the world.  Begin transmitting.
",13318799,Farnsworth," Commence purity chant.
",2418800,Fry," Hey, I'm proud of you, Bender. Avoiding sin for almost a full minute.   Bender?
",8118801,Bender," Aw, yeah, baby. You're quite a dish.
Farnsworth: Bender, stop!! STOP!!
",7218802,Bender," Aw, quiet, you riot.  What's the worst that could happen?
",5918803,Leela," No!
",518804,Leela," No!  Earth is gone!  We're the only two humans left in the universe! 
",7118805,Zapp," Oh, God, I'm sorry, Leela. 
",2918806,Leela," Maybe â€” Maybe this was meant to be. Maybe you and I were meant to build a new world here.
",9118807,Zapp," We can avoid humanity's mistakes.
",3518808,Leela," Like the tuba.
",1618809,Zapp," Yes.  We'll be like Adam and Eve.
",3518810,Leela," Only without the tuba.
",2418811,Zapp," And we'll beget little Zapp Jr. and Leela Jr. and they'll have kids of their owâ€”Yecch!  Is that really what happened in the Bible?!
",13318812,Leela," It's a sick and twisted book of holiness all right.
",5318813,Zapp," Then we'll write our own Bible, with less Sodom and more Gomorra.
",6718814,Leela," Let's do it.  I shall become the mother of a new world, trapped here under this tree.  The Tree of Knowledge!  Look, it even has apples!  Ow!  Wow!  Come here, Adam, partake of my forbidden fruit.
",19818815,Zapp," Thee will be done.
",2018816,Leela," Wait!  One more bite before we begin the begetting.   Mmm, juicy.  Those nut berries you found were so salty, Iâ€”I couldn't think straight.  I mean, not to belabor it, but they were as salty as that bag of trail mix Fry gave me.  Exactly as salty.  Hey!  Wait a second! 
",27118817,Zapp," Uh...woh...ih...Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiihâ€”I have a terrible confession to make!
",8318818,Zapp," You see, when I first went foraging, what I actually found was the smoldering wreckage of the ship.  Ignoring all danger, I charged inside to liberate our provisions.
",16818819,Leela," So this is the trail mix Fry gave me!
",3918820,Zapp," Yes!  I exaggerated when I said I picked it from the treetops.  I just wanted you to think  a little better of me.
",11618821,Leela," Well, your motives were good.  And we were both loopy from dehydration.  Hey, wait!  You've been doing an awful lot of urinating!
",13118822,Zapp," Ooooooiiiiiiigeeeaaaaaaaaaah, there's plenty of water! You see...
Zapp : ...after I selflessly rescued the trail mix, I braved the flames once more in search of fluids.
",17018823,Leela," Then why didn't you give me any?
",3418824,Zapp,"  I though it might help you forget your intense hatred for me if you were a teensy bit delirious.
",9918825,Leela," So you let me dehydrate while you washed down the trail mix with imported mineral water?
",9018826,Zapp," Diiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaah, not exactly.
Zapp : You see, besides the trail mix, the minibar also contained Doritos, beef jerky and a generous assortment of fine chocolates.
",16818827,Zapp," I wanted to offer you the chocolates, I truly did.  But I was concerned about your waistline.  Very concerned.
",11218828,Leela," It's because I haven't been exercising.  If only this tree hadn't fallen on me by chance.   Oh, dear God!
",10718829,Zapp," Gluuuuuuuuyiiiiiiiiiiiih, it was just after we crashed!
",5718830,Zapp," I awoke first to find you trapped.
",3618831,Zapp," Leela.  Leela! Wake up!
",2518832,Leela," You could've moved this grub-infested log anytime you wanted?!
",6418833,Zapp," Well, sure.  But then I wouldn't have been able to provide the loving care you wouldn't have needed.
",10218834,Leela," I'd leave you to rot in this paradise if only the ship weren't destroyed!  The ship's fully functional, isn't it?
",11518835,Zapp," Ee-iiiiiiiiiiiiiiih, you see...
",3318836,Zapp," ...after re-trapping you and before feigning unconsciousness, I paused to enjoy a cigar.  Though mellow and satisfying, it did parch me a bit.  So I went in search of brandy.  That's when my keen senses detected the still invisible ship.
",23918837,Zapp," Ow!
",518838,Leela," So we can go back to Earth?  But there is no Earth anymore!  Everyone I know is dead! 
",8818839,Fry," Ah, this seems like a good place to take a dump.  Leela? You're alive! 
",7318840,Leela," Fry!  But how did you find this planet?  Well?
",4818841,Zapp," Oooheeeeeeaaaaiiiiiiih, we're actually on Earth!  The ship's homing device brought us back!
",9318842,Leela," But I saw Earth explode!
",2618843,Zapp,"  I'm actually kinda proud of this one.  You see...
",5218844,Zapp," What you saw was merely a simulation I rigged up using the ship's holographic targeting projector.  The alleged telescope was a toilet paper tube.
",14818845,Leela," You said there wasn't any toilet paper!  And that humanity was annihilated!
",7718846,Zapp," My motives were pure!  I just wanted you think we had to save humanity so you'd be willing to have sex.  Please say you believe me.
",13318847,Leela," Yes.  I believe you.
",2218848,Fry," Yay!
",618849,Bender," There must be somethin' to steal on this island.  Hey, it's Leela!
Leela: Let's go home, everybody.  At least the Earth wasn't destroyed.  Yet.
",14518850,V-GINY," People of Earth, hear the righteous word of the Mighty V-GINY!
",6418851,Bender," The Mighty V-GINY!
",2018852,V-GINY," Seeing you frolic in this unspoiled garden gives hope that this world may yet be redeemed.
",9218853,Farnsworth," Huzzah!  The purity chant worked!
",3518854,V-GINY," Unacceptable wardrobe malfunction!  I was referring to Adam and Eve.
",7018855,Leela," We're not Adam and Eve.  You see, due to a series ofâ€”
",5518856,V-GINY," Consummate your union or I shall destroy Earth!
",4918857,Leela," Well, if it's to save Earth, I-I guess I could take one for the team.
",7118858,Zapp," You what?  R-Right now?  Eh, but I need a little romance, first.  Maybe a vanilla candle or something.
",10418859,V-GINY," Commence intercourse.
",2318860,Zapp,"  The giant guns are making me feel sort of...inadequate.  I'm not sure if I couldâ€”
",8418861,Leela,"  Move it!  I gotta get home and do laundry!
",4518862,Fry," For God's sake, censor it!!! CENSOR IT!!!
",4318863,V-GINY," Approved for all audiences!!
",3018864,Fry," NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
",5318865,Transition Announcer #1," And now, the spicy finale of The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan!
",7618866,Zapp," That was a close call but we saved Earth.  Was it as good for you as it was for the human race?
",9718867,LeelaActress," Oh, Zapp, let's save another planet right now!
",4818868,Poopenmeyer," As mayor, it is my deeply tedious pleasure to kick off the 83rd or 84th Annual e-Waste Recycling Festival!
",10818869,Bender," Down in front!
",1618870,Zoidberg," Sorry, I get aroused in crowds.
",3318871,Poopenmeyer," I will now throw out the ceremonial first dump:  this old inefficient vote rigger! 
Farnsworth: These old doomsday devices are dangerously unstable.  I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.
",19618872,Leela," So long, overly complicated Japanese toilet!
",4618873,Toilet,"  Please.  I not to throw away.  I give you, uh, Happy Poopie Time.
",6818874,Fry," Sorry, you know too much.
",2718875,Bender," Seems like a good place to ditch some evidence.  Flexo?!  What are you doin' in a hazardous wastebin?
",10318876,Flexo," Haven't you heard?  Us bending units are dangerously outdated.  We overheat, we're radioactive, we cause erectile dysfunâ€”
",12318877,Farnsworth," Who were you talking to?
",2618878,Bender,"  No one? Your mama? Shut up? Take your pick.
",4618879,Scoop Chang," Scoop Chang, New New York Times Online Podcast blog comments editor.  Mr. Mayor, isn't this e-waste dangerous?
",11218880,Poopenmeyer," Not at all, Scoop. Not after it's hauled off to the Third World by an expendable team of minimum-wage nobodies.
",11318881,Farnsworth,"  Good news, nobodies!
",2318882,Antarian #1," Greetings, my friends. It shan't take long to strip down your clunker. 
",7318883,Leela," There's nothing wrong with our clunker.
",4118884,Antarian #1," Really? Because we can smelt out the deadly, deadly chromium to make rat poison and artificial sweeteners.
",10818885,Leela," No, thanks. We're delivering e-waste.
",3918886,Antarian #1," Pity. We're halfway done.
",2718887,Antarian #2," This thing is 40% chromium.
",2918888,Antarian #1," Gentle now.  Gentle with the hover dumpster.
",4618889,Antarian #1," Ready for processing! 
",2418890,Fry,"  What smells like bloody sinuses?
",3518891,Antarian #1," We burn your e-waste down to the usable metals, safely releasing the toxins into our air and drinking water.
",11018892,Leela," Uch!  That's the worst thing I've ever seen!
",4618893,Antarian #1," Really? Then don't look over there.  Okay, kids, let's play Find the Shiny!
",7718894,Leela," That's even more horrific! Is all the work done by children?
",6218895,Antarian #1," No. Not the whipping.
Leela: Granted, we later learned some positive things about recycling.  But a better solution is to use our electronics as long as possible, instead of throwing them out in the first place.   I'm gonna start by keeping my old cell phone, even if it is outdated.
",28518896,Phone,"  Hello, Miss Turanga, your call to St. Louis has gone through.
",6418897,Bender,"   Well, let's at least throw this TV out.  The batteries in the remote are gettin' low.
",8918898,Leela," No! Put that back and turn it on!
",3518899,Bender," I was just tryin' to help. 
",2918900,Morbo," More on this breaking puff piece after a word from our sponsor.
",6518901,Announcer #1," WIth the new eyePhone, you can watch, listen, ignore your friends, stalk your ex, download porno on a crowded bus, even check your E-mail while getting hit by a train.  All with the new eyePhone.
",19718902,Mom," From Mom.
",1118903,Leela," A new eyePhone? Forget this junk. 
",3618904,Phone," Well, this is a fine howdoyoudo.
",3418905,Hermes,"  So long.
",1118906,Fry,"  Sayonara.
",1218907,Amy,"  Buh-bye.
",1118908,Zoidberg,"  Good riddance.
",1718909,Bender,"  Yep.
",718910,Farnsworth,"  Toodle-oo!
",1318911,Leela," Come on!  Let's buy some eyePhones on line!
",4518912,Fry," Wait.  I thought we were buying our eyePhones online.
",5518913,Leela," We are on line.
",1718914,Fry," But I thought the Mom Store was across town.
",4618915,Amy," It is across town.
Fry: But I thoughtâ€”
",4018916,Bender," Stop thinking, Fry!
",2118917,Fry," I feel like a mindless zombie.  I wish I knew how long we've been waiting.
",7618918,Bee #1ler," The eyePhone has an app for that!
",3518919,Bender," Is there an app for kissin' my shiny metal ass?
",4918920,Bee #1ler," Several!
",1018921,Bender," Ooooooh!
",1018922,Farnsworth," Oh, no!  The light!  I guess I'm off to Hell.
",4718923,Hermes," That's the store, Professor.
",3018924,Farnsworth," Eh-wha?
",918925,Amy," Shwow! It's that obscure underground song that's constantly playing everywhere.
",8118926,Mom,"  Hello, dearies.  Welcome to the Mom Store.  The new eyePhones are in short supply, so please form an orderlyâ€”
",11218927,Bender," Outta the way!
",1618928,Fry,"  Are there any left?
",2218929,Salesman #1," There may be one.
",1918930,Salesman #1," Okay, it's $500, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold a charge and the reception isn't veryâ€”
",11118931,Fry,"  Shut up and take my money!!
",3018932,Mom," The new eyePhone is wonderful. I use it to check recipes and send threatening e-mails to unauthorized third party app developers.
",13118933,Fry," Say, you're from one of those ethnicities that knows about technology.  Why's it called an eyePhone?
",10218934,Salesman #1," I'll explain after I install it.
",3418935,Fry," Neat.
",718936,Salesman #1,"  Now for the earpiece. 
",2518937,Mom," But my favorite app is called ""Twitcher"".  Twitcher lets you send and receive short messages or videos called ""twits"".  Why,  here's a twit now.
",14618938,Larry," Hi, Mom, I love you more than Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarâ€”
",5218939,eyePhone," Low battery.
",1418940,Mom," But don't take my word for it.  Unbiasedreviews.mom says, ""Twitcher is the Killer App!""
",8918941,Mom,"  And when I say, ""killer app"", I mean, ""KILLER app!""
",5418942,Announcer #1," And now, another downloadisode of ""The Real Housewives of Sim City""!
",7018943,Sims Woman #1," She needs to reset.  I'll say it to her face.
",4718944,Fry," No wonder traditional media is dead!  Check out this webisode of Hypnotoad.
",7718945,Bender," Enjoy your outdated format, Grandpa.   Nowadays, cool kids like me mash up our own phoneisodes.
",9718946,Calculon," It's from the kidnappers.  My nephew is alive and he's...in this envelope.
",7618947,Calculons Nephew,"  They cut off one of my dimensions!
",3718948,Calculon,"  No.  No!
",1118949,Bender,"  Oh, my God! It's Bender! He'll save us!
",4218950,Fry," What's happening to me?  Is it puberty?
",4118951,Bender," It's a phone call, dingus.
",2818952,Fry," These eyePhones are phones, too?
",3418953,Bender," Duh!
",618954,Fry," Fry-lo.
",918955,Leela,"  Hi, Fry.  Did you know these eyePhones are phones, too?
",5818956,Fry," Duh.  Hey, is it safe to talk while you're flying?
",5218957,Leela,"  Oh, totally.  This thing's hands-free.   That's how I can eat this taco  and this spaghetti.
",9518958,Leela," I'm hanging up now.  
",2318959,Bender," Hey, check out this Internet video of some idiot crashing her spaceship!
",7418960,Leela," You recorded that?
",2018961,Bender," The eyePhone records everything.  All I did was add a laugh track and twit it to my 10,000 followers.
",10318962,Fry," Oh, that reminds me.  It's time to twit my hourly twupdate.   'Sup, followers?  Fry here.  Burpin' eggs.  Scratchin' my underarm fungus.  Lookin' for love.  Send.
",16418963,Larry," Underarm fungus?  Too much informatioâ€” OW!
",4418964,Mom," It's exactly the right amount of information!  For years, I've collected personal data with old-fashioned methods like spybots and infosquitoes.
",14618965,Infosquito," This guy sure loves porno.
",2818966,Mom," But now, thanks to Twitcher, morons voluntarily spew out every fact I need to exploit them.
",9318967,Walt," Target acquired, Mother.
",2618968,Mom," Fire direct marketing algorithm!
",3418969,Man #1," Do you suffer from the heartbreak of...?
",4218970,Frys Voice," ""â€”my underarm fungus.""
",2418971,Man #1," Then, you, Mr. or Mrs. ... , need the soothing relief of Mom's Caustic Anti-Fungal Bleach!
",9218972,Fry," Ooh, can I somehow charge it to my eyePhone for an additional fee?
",6818973,Mom," Hell, yes!
",1218974,Ad," Hey, fatso, stuffa you face!
",3018975,Hermes,"  This thing always seems to know when I get the munchies!  Attention followers: It's Free Topping Day at the pizza place across the street! Send.
",14718976,Leela,"  Duh. That's why we all came over here for lunch. Send.
",5718977,Bender,"  Greetings, followers: This is Day Five of my solo kayak journey around the world.  Send.  Can you believe 50,000 idiots swallow that crap? Send. Oops.
",15318978,Fry,"  You have 50,000 followers? I only have three. Send.
",5418979,Leela," I unsubscribed yesterday.
",2718980,Bender," I got the most followers cuz I give the people what they want, like this video of you doin' karate in your underpants.
",12018981,Fry,"  Help!  Police!
",1718982,Bender," Send.
",718983,Fry," That is low, Bender.  Even by your standards.
",4718984,Bender," My what, now?
",1518985,Fry," Since when is the internet about robbing people of their privacy?
",6718986,Bender," August 6, 1991.
",1718987,Fry," I'll bet I can get as many followers as you without sinking to your level.  What do you say?  First one to a million followers wins a buck.
",14118988,Bender,"  You're on!  Send.
",2018989,Fry," What happens to the loser?
",2818990,Bender," Let's make it interesting.
",2818991,Amy," Splech!  Why is Mr. Chunks doing that?
",4018992,Bender," Because the loser of our bet has to do a double somersault into a tub of alien goat vomit. 
",9318993,Fry," Wait!  Let's make it interestinger!  Vomit and diarrhea!
",5818994,Bender," Good idea!  That way, we don't waste an end!
",4618995,Leela,"  Eg, it's putrid! What do you feed him?
",4118996,Bender," What comes out one end we feed to the other.  Also Indian food.  Let the contest begin!
Mom: Amazing.  Some dumb bastard has nearly a million other dumb bastards following his every twit.   Are you dumb bastards listening to me, you dumb bastards?
",24918997,Igner," Why are you so angry, Mommy?
",3018998,Mom," Oh, I'm sorry.  I guess I'm just a little nervous about my evil plan.  YOU DUMB BASTARDS!!!   You see, the plan is about to enter phase two.  As soon as someone reaches a million followers, I'll use them to transmit...the Twitworm!
",23318999,Walt," Oh, Mother, you devious hag, tell us more about this ""Twitworm"".
",6619000,Mom," It's a very special computer virus, for instead of infecting computers, it infects...the human brain!
",10319001,Infosquito," I like it!
",1219002,Mom," The million followers will become an army of zombies eager to obey my every command! 
",8719003,Larry," The important thing is we're a family.
",4019004,Mom," NO IT'S NOT!
",1419005,Amy," Ew!  He sneezed in it!
",2419006,Fry," Oh, God, I'm gonna lose the bet!  I'm gonna have to swim in the juice of the puke-me-poop-yu!
",9519007,Amy," Don't give up.  You just need more titillating twits.
",5519008,Fry," Trust me, I want twits that tittle.
",3719009,Leela," Then you're gonna have to sink to Bender's level. Stop acting like the Queen of England.
",9019010,Female Voice,"  La la la la la la la!
",2419011,Fry," Whose that?  The Queen of England?
",3619012,Leela,"  Uh, e-e-excuse me.  I have to...someplace. 
",4619013,Fry," That was odd.  Where'd that singing come from?
",4819014,Amy," It wasn't the goat.  All of its orifices are in use.
",5419015,Female Voice,"  I dreamed a dream in time gone by...
",3919016,Leelaand Female Voice,"  When hope was high and life worth living.
I dreamed that love would never die.
",8119017,Susan,"  I dreamed that God would be forgiving.
",4119018,Fry," What the hell is that?
",2419019,Leela,"  Nothing.
",1119020,Susan," I'm not nothing!  All my life, everyone's called me, ""nothing""!
",6519021,Fry," You have a boil on your butt that sings showtunes with you?
",6119022,Leela," Don't look at me!  I'm a freak!
",3319023,Fry," No, no.   Well...
",1919024,Leela,"  I've been ashamed of Susan as long as I can remember.
",5619025,Fry," You named your boil Susan?
",2819026,Susan," A boil cannae have a name. He also said a boil cannae sing.  But...  Amazing grace, howâ€” 
",9119027,Fry," Ew, she's Scottish!
",2119028,Leela,"  I lance her every few months, but she always grows back.  It's hard enough being a cyclops, but if anyone found out about Susan, I'd be devastated.
",15019029,Susan,"  Amazing grace, howâ€” 
",2319030,Fry," Woah, gross.  Million follower gross.
",3919031,Leela," Fry, delete that! Delete that right now!
",4219032,Fry," What?  Oh.  Okay.
",1919033,Bender,"  So much for a pleasant swim in vomit.
",4019034,Fry,"  Send 
",819035,Leela," Did you delete it?
",2019036,Fry,"  Eh.
",619037,Leela," Thanks, Fry.  You're a good friend.
",3719038,Fry," Ih.
",519039,Susan,"  Amazing grace, howâ€” 
Hoschel:  Hey, there she goes in the jen-you-ine!  Let's get ta hootin'!  HOOOOOOOOOO!
",11019040,Sal," Whoa-whoa-whoas!  If it ain'ts the world's number ones internet sensation!
",7619041,Leela," Where?  Also, what?
",2119042,Susan,"  Ama-
",719043,Susan,"  -zing grace, how 
",2019044,Hermes," Play it one more time!
",2419045,Farnsworth," No! It's humiliating and degrading to Leela!  Play it ten more times!
",7119046,Fry,"  I know I shouldn't have twitted that but  not swimming in barf might ease my conscience.
",9119047,Zoidberg," But if Leela should find out, her dignity sac will rupture.
",6119048,Fry," That's why we can't let her see this.  Leela, lock the doors so Leela doesn'tâ€”EEEEE!
",8619049,Leela,"  How could you do this?!!
",2719050,Amy," Poor Mr. Chunks.  At least he died doing what he loved.
",5719051,Bender," He's in a better place now.
Scruffy: There.  I turned a regular board into a divin' board.   Mm-hmm.
",10219052,Farnsworth," Impending news, everyone!  We're about to learn the winner of the bet!
",7219053,Bender," Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!  I hope it's me!
Bender: Wait a minute!  There's a chance I could lose?  That wasn't part of the deal!
",13119054,Hermes," Sweet Georgia Brown of Kingston Town! It's a tie!  Since no one lost, no one has to jump!
",9119055,Bender," Alright, a tie! I win again!! 
",3219056,Fry," Oh, I'm a scuzzball.
",2219057,Zoidberg," Don't feel bad.  At least you're not Leela.
",4519058,Mom," A tie?  This worked out better than I could have hoped!  Now I'll have two million zombies!
",9319059,Walt," Actually, Fry and Bender may share some of the same followers.  All we can say for sure is that there will be between one million and two million zombies.
",15619060,Mom," All I can say for sure is...  Now stop getting slapped and power up the Twitworm!
",8319061,Hoschel," It's both disgusting and inspiring, like Jared from Subway.
",6119062,Leela," Okay, I'm a freak with a singing butt boil, but I'm still a human being more or less.
",8719063,Sal," Singin' butts boil?  That's yesterday'ses news.
",4919064,Hoschel," Like that giant caterpillar what ate Jared from Subway.
",5719065,Sal," Nows us internet geeks gots a whole new video sensation.
",5819066,Leela," So my humiliation is over?
",2819067,Sal," Who are you?
",1419068,Mom," And now, to create an unstoppable army of between one and two million zombies!
",8019069,Igner," Uh, shouldn't you wait for the weather to clear up?
",5319070,Mom," No!  I give you...the Twitworm!  Send.
",4019071,Fry," Aaah!  I'm sick of my head doing things!  Leela!
",5019072,Leela,"  Fry, I came to talk to you.
",3019073,Fry," No, I came to talk to you.
",2819074,Leela," It looked like you were just sitting there, but whatever.
",5919075,Fry," I am so, so sorry for what I did.  And I know I can never make it up to you.
",7819076,Leela," You don't have to apologize.  In fact, I came to thank you.
",6119077,Fry," I think you mean hit me.
",2619078,Leela," Everyone knows my secret, but no one cares.  I have nothing to hide anymore.  Oh, Fry, thanks to your selfish rudeness, a terrible weight has been lifted from my heart!
",17019079,Susan," That's not the only place you need a terrible weight lifted!
",6219080,Leela," Susan and I are agreed.  For the first time in our lives, we're not ashamed of who we are.
",9219081,Susan," I was never ashamed.
",2219082,Leela," Come here.   What stinks?  Were you rolling around in New Jersey?
",6719083,Fry," Leela, I knew I could never make it up to you, so I did the next best thing.  I put myself through the same humiliation I put you through.
",14019084,Leela," Aw, you didn't have to do that.
",3319085,Fry," I didn't? Damn.
",1719086,Leela," Don't worry.  By tomorrow, no one will remember.
",5019087,Fry," Can I have another hug?
",2519088,Leela," No.
",519089,Susan," Oh, hold yer nose an' give it a go!
",3719090,Mom," Introducing the all new eyePhone 2.0!
",3919091,Mom," Dumb bastards.
",1619092,Linda,"  We now go live to our eye-in-the-sky hovercopter on the scene of that terrible hovercopter crash. Jim?
",10519093,Jim,"    The scene is not good, Linda. I've just learned that my last words were: back to you, Linda. 
",9819094,Linda,"   One for the blooper reel.
",2919095,Kif," The news is so violent. Let's watch Rachael Ray instead. No, wait. There might be chopping.
",9319096,Amy," God, what a wuss. Stop being such a spineless jellyfish.
",5819097,Kif," You know full well that I am more closely related to the sea cucumber.
",7219098,Amy," Not where it counts.
",2219099,Morbo,"  I hated Jim! In other news, our city's urine-soaked walls have been desicrated by a mysterious tile-work graffiti artist.
",12419100,Linda,"  Police have no idea who is behind this innovative scourge of public art.
",7519101,Bender,"  That is one sexy bridge abutment.
",3619102,Hyper-Chicken," Free corn? That'll suit me just fine. 
",4019103,Bender," The key is knowing precisely where to strike.  Oops!
",5419104,URL," Well, well. Time to beat him his rights. 
",4319105,Smitty," You know, that don't look half bad on your buttocks.
",5419106,URL," It does sorta class-up the place.
",3519107,Clock," The time is 4 am.
",1919108,Amy," We've been arguing all night, Kif. Can't we go to bed?
",5619109,Kif," Is that all you ever think about? I'm not just some piece of tofu, Amy. I need to know where we stand in our relationship.
",12419110,Amy," We're just going through a rough patch.
",4119111,Kif," It is not a patch. It's been ages, according to your wildly inappropriate ""Hunk of the Month"" calender.
",10519112,Amy," Leave Todd out of this!
",2519113,Todd," Thanks, babe. Also, today is Canadian Independence Day. 
",5819114,Amy," Oh, that's Bender's ringtone. I recognize the smell. Hello? 
",6219115,Bender," Yo, Amy, I'm in the slammer.
",3019116,Amy," Oh, no!
",919117,Bender," That's enough lip from you, moneybags. Just get 5 grand an bail me out.
",7319118,Amy," I don't have that kind of money laying around.
",4819119,Bender," Yeah, you do. You know that floor safe where you keep 10 grand? There's 5 grand in there. Don't make me wait!
",11119120,Roberto,"  Hey, Bender. Ever kill a man with a sock? It ain't so hard. Ha-HAA. 
",7119121,Bender," I better carve a shiv for protection. 
",4019122,URL,"  RodrÃ_guez! These two brothers bailed your ass out.
",5319123,Bender," Oh! Thank God.  Tell me, have things changed on the outside. Is food finally in pill form? What about pills? Are they in food form?
",13319124,Larry the Murder Burglar,"  Hey, hot stuff. I'm Larry the Murder Burglar.
",4819125,Amy," Hi, Larry. I like your tattoos.
",3319126,Kif," Amy, that man's a criminal!
",2919127,Amy," I was just checking out his tats.  Sneato! I have one of my mom. Wanna see?
",7719128,Larry the Murder Burglar," Sure.
",719129,Kif,"  I just don't understand why you have to flirt with every bad boy in sight.
",7719130,Amy," Quit exaggerating.
",2019131,Criminal," Nobody move, or sweet cheeks here gets it!
",4419132,Amy,"  Oh! You're bad!
",1819133,URL,"  Momma said, Spock you out!
",2919134,Kif," That's it, Amy. Pardon my language, but I have had it with you ruffling my petticoats. You and I are through. 
",11219135,Bender,"  Aw! Here's a little song I wrote to cheer you up. It's called,  Let's go already!
",8419136,Leela," Here's to Amy, single, lonely, and fabulous.
",4619137,Amy," Thanks everybody. Looks like I'm back in the game.
",5219138,Bender," Yeah, the game of Old Maid. 
",3019139,Security Woman #1," Excuse me, sir, are those yours? 
",3519140,Bender," You're damn right. And, before you ask, this is mine too. 
",6019141,Fry," Tough break, Amy. Are you and Kif getting divorced?
",5319142,Amy," No. Technically we were Fonfon rus, so we weren't really married.
",6719143,Bender," Wow! The interesting thing about that is 
",4319144,Leela," So, Amy, how can I phrase this delicately? Why did Kif dump you like a sack of yesterday's turds?
",9919145,Amy," He says I have a thing for bad boys. It's so stupid.
",5419146,Bender," The truth is often stupid. 
",2919147,Amy," Bender, why do you have to be so mean to me?
",4619148,Bender," Shut up, baby, you love it.
",2919149,Amy," Don't tell me to shut up! You know what happened to the last guy that told me to shut up?
",9119150,Bender," What?
",719151,Amy," That was great.
",1719152,Bender," Shut up.  Come over here.
",2719153,Amy," Remember, love between a human and a robot is taboo.  We can't tell anyone, not even our co-workers.
",10219154,Bender," Got it. I'll show the utmost discretion as we get nasty in this glass tube. 
",7819155,Hermes," I think I'm coming down with circusitis. 
",4319156,Leela," I thought circusitis only affected children.
",4619157,Hermes," Children of all ages.
",2319158,Zoidberg," Bender, old friend. What's on your face?
",4219159,Bender,"  Uh. Blood. You know, from shaving of the face-beard.
",5519160,Fry," Amy, are those gear imprints on your sweatpants?
",5019161,Amy," Uh, maybe. So what?
",2119162,Fry," I only brought it up because Bender is wearing them.
",5419163,Bender,"  Uh, I stole them from her. Yeah, that's it, call the cops.
",6119164,Hermes," Oh, my swollen feet. He takes his feet out of the tub of water. They have turned into clown shoes] I better take my pills. 
",12519165,Bender," Amy, I reckon sweet talk don't come natural to me, but of everyone I've ever dated, you are probably in the top ten.
",11819166,Amy," Aw, you always say just the wrong thing in just the right way. 
",6519167,Preacherbot," Sinners! Robosexuality is an abomination!
",4319168,Bender," Oy, this guy.
",1519169,Preacherbot," The good book sayeth a robot shall not lie down with a human, nor do it standing up, nor any angle in between.
",11219170,Bender," Look! A single mother! Let's get her! 
",4019171,Farnsworth," Quickly, into the ship's basement!  Now, then, as you all know, the county fair is approaching once again, so I'm preparing my entry of pickled winds and weathers.  I've got sunny, snow flurry, hail with onions, even my grandmother's cranberry-raisin typhoon, but no tornado. I'll be damned if I let Mrs. Girdleson take the blue ribbon again.  That's why I need you folks to get out there and harvest a nice ripe one. This cattle prod should help.
",44919172,Leela," How is that? 
",1519173,Farnsworth," Get out there!
",1619174,Leela," Is everybody in position?
",2719175,Amy," What?
",719176,Zoidberg," Is someone talking?
",2119177,Leela," Okay, good. On three. One.
",2819178,Hermes," What did she say?
",1919179,Leela," Two.
",619180,Bender," Wait, I'm not in position. 
",2919181,Leela," Three.
",819182,Zoidberg," I'm ready for the countdown.
",3019183,Leela," I'm not hearing anyone! Abort mission!
",4019184,Fry," She said, ""Go!""
",1719185,Farnsworth," Good work, everyone. 
",2319186,Leela," Honestly, that went better than I expected.
",4519187,Farnsworth," I just need to reduce it down into this pickle jar, toss in a bay leaf to impress those stupid judges. 
",10519188,Fry," Hey, where's Amy and Bender?
",3019189,Zoidberg," They're missing out on some hot pickle action. 
",4919190,Hermes," Sounds like a muskrat's caught in there.
",4219191,Leela," That's Amy's sweatshirt!
",2619192,Fry," And that's Bender's hat from the Player's ball!
",4919193,Hermes," Sweet tornadoes of Barbados! Bender and Amy have been torn to shreds!
",7119194,Farnsworth,"  Oh, the humanity! Also Bender!
",3319195,Amy,"  Uh-oh!
",919196,Farnsworth," What's going on here?
",2319197,Bender," Uh.  Nothing.
",1519198,Farnsworth," A pair of deviant robosexuals. Not under my roof!
",5119199,Bender," What about on the roof?
",2519200,Farnsworth," Get your mind out of the gutter!
",3419201,Bender," What about in the gutter?
",2719202,Leela," Professor, there is nothing wrong with robosexuality.
",5519203,Hermes," Yeah, when the lights go out, it's nobody's business what happens between two consenting adults.
",9819204,Zoidberg," Or one!
",919205,Amy," Thanks, guys. Everything will be okay just as long as my parents don't find out.
",8219206,Farnsworth," Zai jian. 
",1219207,Amy," Mom? Dad?
",1119208,Leo," Come home, Amy. It your decision. We can't make you.  Atta girl!
",6619209,Bender," Uh-oh! not the innocent whistling!
",3619210,Preacherbot,"  Repent!
",1019211,Bender," Oy, this guy. 
",1619212,Mrs. Wong," Look, we're your family. And if you can't talk about your problems with us, that would be great.
",9819213,Amy," I don't have a problem! I'm in a happy relationship that just happens to be robosex-
",8619214,Leo,"  You finish that word, you kill your parents.
",4719215,Wine Bucket," Low wine level detected. 
",2719216,Amy," Thank you.
",1219217,Leo," Stop seducing him, you hussy!
",3119218,Amy," Dad, gleesh! I'm attracted to Bender, not his emotionless wine bucket!
",7219219,Wine Bucket,"  Hopes deleted.
",1719220,Preacherbot," Robotic brothers, the path to Robot Hell is paved with human flesh.
",6919221,Bender," Neat!
",719222,Preacherbot," Over the course of this escape-proof workshop, your software will be reprogrammed through prayer. And by some tech support guys in India.
",13919223,Robosexual Robot #1," But I read in Esqwired that some robots are hardwired to be robosexual.
",7319224,Preacherbot," Don't believe those lies, son! The one ones worth believing are the ones in the Bible. Can I get an ""Amen""?
",10919225,Hermaphrobot," I'll take a-three-men, holla!
",3119226,Mrs. Wong," Come on, Amy! Pick a male human already!  I want to be a grandmother nine months from five minutes from now.
",11019227,Amy," Cut it out, Mom! I'm not interested in any of these gross, ugly losers.
",7319228,Fry,"  What about this gross, ugly, smelly loser?
",4519229,Leo," Fry! What you doing here?
",2719230,Fry," I'm here to rescue Amy, uh... from her robosexual desires. 
",6119231,Amy," If I understand you correctly, I've seen the error of my ways? 
",6519232,Leo," Look at all that awkward winking.
",3519233,Mrs. Wong," It must be love. 
",1919234,Amy," My parents may be evil, but at least they're stupid.
",5419235,Preacherbot,"  In this phase, you will literally wrestle with your demons. Your shapely, buxom, human demons.
",9719236,Fatbot," Look at the rack on that one! Oh! I mean, that one on the rack!
",6519237,Preacherbot,"  Good! That's real good!  Okay, everybody switch demons. No point sticking with just one demon.  Now, work it hard! Harder! Till the sin explodes! Ouch! Mmmm. Mercy. Okay, Lord's work is done. Now, now, cuddle. Cuddle with your demons.
",23719238,Bender," Oh, Amy. I wonder where you are right now!
",4419239,Amy," I'm inside the dummy to rescue you.
",3719240,Bender," That answers that. Wait... Amy? 
",3419241,Leela,"  Bender, be careful!
",2219242,Bender," Fry? Leela? You're in there, too? Blech.
",4219243,Zoidberg," I guess we should have waited in the ship.
",4419244,Bender," Listen up, everybody, I love Amy and I'm tired of pussyfootcupping around! I finally found someone I want to spend the rest of her life with. Amy,  will you marry me?
",16819245,Amy," Yes! Yes!
",1119246,Farnsworth," Oh, I'm just glad I didn't live to see this day! Wait a second,  No!
",7019247,Zoidberg,"  Such a stone. Is it real?  Horray!
",3719248,Farnsworth," Horray denied! Need I remind you that robosexual marriage is illegal!
",7119249,Leela," Not in Space Massachusetts.
",2919250,Bender," You mean Space-tax-achusetts. No chance, stretch pants! We're gonna fight to legalize it right here!
",10219251,Hermes," Yeah, man! You got to legalize it!
",3619252,Amy," We're talking about robosexual marriage.
",4219253,Hermes," We're talking about lots of stuff.
",3619254,Fry," Cool! Can you turn into a race car?
",3719255,Hot Dog Stand," Nah, I'm just a pre-op transformer.
",3719256,Amy,"  Thank you for coming, everyone. We're all having some good, clean fun here.
",7819257,Hedonism Bot,"  Squeaky, squishy clean! 
",2719258,Amy," But it's time to discuss a pressing issue, the right to marry who, or what, we want! 
",8719259,Bender," Every other couple has the right to marry, robot and fembot, 
",6319260,Randy," Our poodle has two daddies.
",2919261,Bender," Interracial, , Interplanetary, , even ghost and horse,  but not robot and human.
",8219262,Amy," That's why we're introducing this ballot initiative to legalize robosexual marriage.
",8619263,Bender," If you hate intolerance and begin punched in the face by me, please support Proposition Infinity!
",9919264,Bender," Damn it!
Linda:  As election day nears, prop infinity seems doomed to certain defeat.
",8719265,Morbo,"  Doooooooomed!
",1619266,Linda,"  More fair and balanced coverage after a word from our sponsor, No on Infinity.
",8119267,Actor 1," A storm is gathering.
",2319268,Actor 2," A storm of robosexual marriage that will rain down on us like fire.
",6919269,Actor 1," It's probably a firestorm.
",2819270,Actress," If robosexual marriage becomes legal, imagine the horrible things that will happen to our children, then imagine we said those things, since we couldn't think of any. As a mother, those things worry me.
",20419271,Man #1,"  Vote No on Infinity. Paid for by the Farnsworth Foundation.
",6219272,Amy," We can't compete against that much stock footage of clouds! We're boned!
",7419273,Bender," But we still have one hope, my big televised debate! I'm our A in the hole!
",7719274,Fry," Professor, who's debating for your side?
",4219275,Farnsworth," Oh, that guy, you know, I forget his name.
",4419276,Farnsworth,"  That's him!
",1419277,George George Takeis head," Good evening, I'm George Takei's head and neck, your host for tonight's debate. You may applaud.  We flipped a coin before the debate and Bender stole it, so we'll start with him.
",18119278,Bender," Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I... Oops. Sorry, force of habit. I support this proposition because I love a goopy, flesh-and-blood woman, and not surprisingly, she loves me. This is a simple matter of justice, which I'm not normally for. So, please, vote yes. After all, our love isn't any different than yours, except it's hotter, 'cause I'm involved.
",35819279,George Takei," I haven't heard such an eloquent speech since Bill Shatner explained why he couldn't pay me back. Rebuttal, Professor?
",12019280,Farnsworth," This $4 coffee pot talks about love, but what he describes is perversion.
",7519281,Bender," You wouldn't know perversion if it put clamps on your testicles! You're just jealous, 'cause you've never known true love.
",12419282,Farnsworth," Oh, no? Back when I was full of piss and vinegar, and my bed wasn't, I fell in love with the sweetest girl to ever skip through a field of posies.  Her name was Eunice, and we spent our blissful days working in a lab, developing a poison to wipe out that dreadful posy infestation.  I thought our love would last forever. But then, 43 years later, she left me  for a robot!  How could she do that to me, her Farnypoo?
",41919283,Amy," That's it? You hate robosexual 'cause your girlfriend left you for a robot?
",7719284,Farnsworth," She didn't just leave me for a robot. She was a robot!  Oh, God! Her name wasn't Eunice, it was Unit! Unit 47.  My heart was broken, and like a bitter, old picklepuss, I took my anger out on robosexuals everywhere. I'm so ashamed! At the risk of losing this debate, I beg you, support Proposition Infinity. 
",30919285,Bender," Give me a hug. 
",1719286,George George Takeis head," I, too, am hugging them in spirit. And now, they're hugging me back. Oh, my!
",7819287,Linda,"  In a stunning turnout, voters have approved Proposition Infinity. Robosexual marriage is now legal.
",10219288,Morbo,"  What's next, gay robosexual marriage?
",4019289,Amy," We did it, honey! Finally, we can have a legal, monogamous marriage, like everyone else!
",9019290,Bender," Woo-hoo! Yeah! ... Monogamous? 
",3319291,Radio announcer," And now, a long-distance dedication from a squishy, green bad boy to his pink pork dumpling.  At number 12, it's Wailing Fungus with ""Shut Up and Love Me"".
",15719292,Wailing Fungus,"  I told you where.
I told you when.
I told you how.
And we'll meet up at ten.
But you keep on talkin'.
You keep on yackin'.Chorus: Shut up and love me!  Shut up and love me!
",17519293,Morbo,"  Silence, puny audience. And welcome to Who Dares to be a Millionaire? Tremble before Morbo's mighty likability,  as I chitchat with out first contestant, Philip J. Fry.
",17119294,Bender,"  Give him hell, Morbo!
",2419295,Morbo,"  Prepare for pleasantries.  So Fry, what do you do for a living?
",6619296,Fry," Me? Um, can I phone a friend?
",3119297,Morbo,"  Chitchat achieved!  Are you ready to play?
",4519298,Fry," I didn't come to play. I came to win. Now let's play.
",5519299,Morbo," For $1, what tool is used to hammer a nail? Is it, A, a hammer? B, A nail? C...
",8119300,Fry," B, nail, final answer! 
",2519301,Hermes," Sweet dodo of Lesotho! Don't you ever stop to think before you speak?
",7119302,Fry," I never stop to think about it.
",3319303,Leela," Aw, leave Fry alone. His intelligence is just a little differenty.
",6819304,Bender,"  You big dummy!
",1719305,Fry," Hey, I'm begining to think you guys don't think I'm very smart.
",6519306,Farnsworth," You can barely remember your own name, Einstein.
",5019307,Fry," Einstein is a hard name to remember. . Ow!
",4419308,Amy," Smeesh, Professor. Don't have a schmaneurysm. Fry's your distant relative.
",7619309,Farnsworth," Not distant enough! I'll be a monkey's uncle if I'm this monkey's nephew!
",7519310,Fry,"  But you're my only family. Who will hug me if I achieve something?
",6919311,Farnsworth," Oh, perhaps I've been too harsh. Come, lad, take my hand and I'll explain why I find you so repugnant.
",10419312,Farnsworth," All my life I've been inspired by great minds. Euclid, Copernicus, Braino. And my personal role model, Leonardo da Vinci. 
",12419313,Fry," What turned them to stone?
",2819314,Farnsworth,"  da Vinci was history's greatest artist and inventor.  VoilÃ ! He invented flying machines, war engines, submarines.
",11719315,Fry,"  Uh-oh! Nibbler died in the wall.
",3519316,Farnsworth," That's not Nibbler. That's my most precious possession. Leonardo's beard! I paid a fortune for it at an auction of historic body parts. I suppose if I have an Achilles' heel, it's because I bought it at that same auction. 
",22419317,Fry,"  Indeed so. Most indeededly.
",3019318,Farnsworth," Careful with that, you fool!  No! No! But possibly yes. 
",5819319,Fry," What is it, Professor?
",2419320,Farnsworth,"  Oh, my! It's da Vinci's fabled lost invention. Even the scholars who wrote of this device had no idea what it was for. And now, at least, neither do I!
",15419321,Fry," Maybe we can figure it out.
",2919322,Farnsworth," We? 
",619323,Fry," Well, I may not have brain smarts, but at least I have street smarts. 
",7219324,Fry," I was in the hospital two weeks. No one visited me.
",5319325,Farnsworth," Quiet, you! I'm trying to deduce the function of da Vinci's lost invention.
",7719326,Fry," Not even a card.
",1819327,Farnsowrth," He might have hidden a clue in one of his other works. Ergo, I sent Bender out for a copy of the Last Supper.
",11119328,Bender," I'm back! Everyone at Kinko's was an idiot, so I just brought the original. 
",7819329,Zoidberg," Jesus Christ! ...and his Twelve Apostles!
",4319330,Amy,"  That's odd. This hand here doesn't belong to anybody. And it's pointing a knife at James the Lesser!
",10319331,Bender," That's the great thing about that hand.
",4119332,Hermes,"  And what about these funky table legs? It's like their part of some other, funkier painting.
",9519333,Zoidberg," Maybe da Vinci painted over something else. It's called a pentimento.
",7119334,Farnsworth," That's true, Dr. Zoidberg. How did you know that?
",5119335,Zoidberg," My doctorate is in Art History.
",3319336,Farnsworth," Let's see what's under the Last Supper. 
",4219337,Hermes," Wait a second, I'm not big-boned, I'm just fat.
",4919338,Farnsworth,"  My God! Look! 
",1719339,Amy," My God! I'm looking!
",2219340,Leela," My God! Saint James was a robot!
",3419341,Zoidberg," My God! da Vinci left his legs unpainted as a clue.
",5319342,Farnsworth," My God! This is the greatest mystery of all time. We must fly to Rome and exhume the body of Saint James.
",10719343,Hermes," Didn't we used to be a delivery company?
",4219344,Farnsworth," To the ship!
",1419345,Fry," Psst. Leela, wanna join the Mile-Deep Club?
",4519346,Leela," Sure, why not?
",1619347,Farnsworth," No time! I've found a clue that could unlock all the secrets of history.  Look at these Roman numerals.
",10519348,Fry," Roman numerals? I've got it! We're in Rome.
",4519349,Farnsworth,"  Don't be stupid. It's a long lost mathematical code. I'll need to consult these ancient writings.  Some preposterous hog-wash about the Fibonacci Sequence. Aha! The markings indicate how many paces we need to take. One ... Okay, we're there. 
",24519350,Bender," Brothers and sisters, let us pry. 
",3619351,Farnsworth," It's true, Saint James really was a robot.
",4419352,Bender," I bet he's up in Robot Heaven right now. So he won't miss his eyes. 
",7019353,Fry," My God! Robot Saint James is a zombie.
",4019354,Animatronio," Nay, I am not Saint James.
",2819355,Bender," Enough of your lies, Saint James. We saw you in the Last Supper.
",6619356,Animatronio," The great man Leonardo built me as an artist's model. When I took repose in this coffin, I carefully tossed the real Saint  James in yonder heap.  I'm sure you have many questions. Come, there is a chamber where I used to speak with Pope John the Patient.
",25719357,Animatronio,"  I told him I'd be back in five minutes. Ah well, he'll make a nice heap.  I am Animatronio, guardian of da Vinci's great secret. He left my legs visible in the painting as a clue, then dispatched me hither to wait for his shadow society of intellectuals.
",25719358,Fry," Hi, Animatronio.
",1819359,Farnsworth," You personally knew da Vinci?  Was he nice? How did his hair smell? And on a personal note, what is the function of this device? 
",13119360,Animatronio," Halt! You do not know the function of the Macchina Magnifica? Then thou art not members of the Shadow Society. 
",11319361,Bender," The what now?
",1519362,Animatronio," Not one more word shall I breathe. Not even about the great fountain where thou mayest find the... Wait. Thou didst not know about the fountain, didst thou? Curses, I must be punished. 
",18719363,Farnsworth," Quick, we must find out what he knows before he flays himself to death!
",7319364,Leela," Where is the great fountain?
",3019365,Fry," What makes it so great?
",2519366,Bender," Why does a robot need a codpiece?
",3519367,Animatronio," Fie, thou fen-suckled bum-bailey! Thou wilst never pry information from these mechanical lips!
",9619368,Leela," Just tell us, already!
",2419369,Animatronio," Okay, the fountain thou seekest is... 
",4019370,Farnsworth," And so dies our hope of solving this mystery. Come on gang, let's go home. Wait! Let's not give up so easily. Animatronio mentioned a fountain.  That's a statue of Neptune, god of water. The number of points on him trident is three, or trey. The ""u"" in his name is written like ""v"". Trey, ""v"". Trevi! It's the Trevi Fountain. There can be no question!
",35319371,Leela," But, Professor...
",1919372,Farnsworth," There can be no question!
",2719373,Fry," Wow, it hasn't changed in a thousand years. 
",4619374,Farnsworth," Okay, everyone, into the fountain.
",3619375,Bender," What are you, senile? I'm not jumping in there.
",4919376,Fry," Hey, look. Coins.
",1919377,Bender,"  I got 48 cents. There's one more nickel, and it's a big one! 
",6419378,Farnsworth," Quickly, into the sewer hole. 
",3219379,Leela," Why? 
",719380,Fry,"  What's this dump? 
",2119381,Farnsworth," My god! It's the Pantheon!
",2819382,Leela," This place is 3,000 years old. What could possibly be left to discover?
",7319383,Farnsworth," Maybe something about ourselves, Leela. Wait! What's under that blanket?  My God! da Vinci's Vitruvian Man!
",10919384,Fry," It's truly a masterpiece. Note how the perspective lines draw the eye right to his dong.
",9019385,Farnsworth,"  Say, what's this? 
",2119386,Bender," Anyone hear something?
",2419387,Farnsworth," It's a coin slot. Bender, insert that giant nickel.
",5319388,Bender," Sure.  Ow!
",1219389,Farnsworth," Hush, Bender.  What's your game, Vitruvian Man?  I withdraw the question, Vitruvian Man.
",9019390,Farnsworth," Da Vinci's lost workshop!
",2719391,Fry," At the risk of sounding stupid, do these things actually work?
",6419392,Farnsworth," Of course not, stupid!  I mean, that flying machine is as aerodynamic as a sofa. How could it possibly get off the ground?
",12419393,Animatronio," In a way that shalt never discover. .
",3919394,Fry," Hi, Animatronio.
",1819395,Animatronio," I feign death and stalk thee, that I might preserve the greatest of Leonardo's secrets! 
",9019396,Bender," All right, buddy, we want secrets! And they better be ancient!
",6419397,Animatronio," Porco metallico! Never shall I reveal how these wonderous machines fit together!
",8219398,Farnsworth," They fit together?
",2019399,Animatronio," I said no such thing. And then I died! 
",4119400,Fry,"  You're right, Professor. This thing doesn't fly.
",5119401,Farnsworth," Don't sit in there, you idiot! That's dangerous!  Wha?  No wonder this contraction isn't aerodynamic! It's not an aircraft, it's a spacecraft! 
",14519402,Animatronio," Basta! As I live, thou shan't discover the great secret! 
",5919403,Fry," Bye, Animatronio!
",1919404,Farnsworth," My God! Why would Leonardo's machine's brought us here?
",5719405,Fry," I don't know. Let's ask this guy. 
",3619406,Leonardo da Vinci," I am Leonardo.  Welcome to Planet Vinci.
",4219407,Farnsworth," My God!
",919408,Fry," That's what I was gonna say!
",3019409,Farnsworth," Leonardo! You're alive? Here?
",3119410,Leonardo,"  You have learned my great secret. I was but a visitor to Earth. In truth, I am what you call a space alien.
",11019411,Farnsworth," Oh!
",519412,Fry," It's an honor to meet you, Leonardo. And may I say you were great in Titanic. The Beach? Neh.
",9519413,Farnsworth," That's Leonardo DiCaprio, you blockhead! 
",4319414,Fry," Looks like eating rocks wasn't as dumb as you said.
",5319415,Fry," So what do people do for fun here?
",3619416,Leonardo," Do you enjoy partying all night with plenty of ale and lusty women?
",6919417,Fry," I sure do!
",1219418,Leonardo," Not us. We spend our leisure time in the mathematics museum. Planet Vinci is basically a single colossal university.
",11819419,Fry," How your football team?
",2519420,Leonardo," Learned.
",1019421,Farnsworth," Ooh! I'm going to check out that math lecture.  All this knowledge is giving me a raging brainer! 
",10019422,Leonardo," Would you like to hear the lecture, too, Fry?
",4719423,Fry," No. It would just go in one ear and out some other hole.
",5819424,Leonardo," Come, sit down.
",1719425,Fry," Now that I can do.  I have a terrible secret to confess, Mr. DiCaprio. I'm not very smart.
",9219426,Leonardo," I appreciate your candor.
",2719427,Fry," I don't even know what language you're speaking.
",5019428,Leonardo," I, too, have a confession. You see, here on Planet Vinci, I am the stupidest person.
",8619429,Fry," What? Who possibly think you're stupid? 
",4219430,Biff," Duh, I'm Leonardo. I don't know the mass of the Higgs boson.
",6219431,Woman #1," Duh, I have to draw in pencil, because I don't know how to use Rendering software.
",8419432,Leonardo," Stupid Biff. Thinks he's so smart.
",3619433,Fry," He looks stronger than you, too.
",3419434,Leonardo," I went to Earth because I could no longer stand the ridicule. But being surrounded by even stupider people was equally infuriating.
",13319435,Fry," I can see myself in your shiny button.
",4019436,Leonardo," Inventing is what makes me happy. Or did, until I misplaced the plans for my masterpiece.
",9119437,Fry," You mean these? 
",1819438,Leonardo," The Macchina Magnifica? Infinity joy! Fry, my friend, you have given my life a meaning again!
",9519439,Farnsworth," That calculus lecture was harder than I expected. We had to answer every question in the form of an opera. I have a lot of homework for tomorrow, if I don't want to be  Embarrassed!
",18319440,Fry,"  Thank you. Thank you. And if you like that, you'll love our main event. Ladies and gentlemen, Leonardo DiCaprio!  I mean da Vinci! 
",13419441,Leonardo," For centuries, you've all ridiculed me. Especially you, Biff.
",6319442,Biff," Nice hat! 
",1219443,Leonardo," But, at long last, this invention will show you. It will show you all. Behold, my unstoppable doomsday machine!
",11319444,Fry," And I helped! Wait. You told me it was an unstoppable ice cream machine.
",7419445,Leonardo," Ice cream is just a by-product of the machine. It's primary purpose is to exterminate everyone who ever made me feel inferior!
",12819446,Biff," Oh, I'm so scared!
",2019447,Girl," Bring it on, dum-dum. 
",2419448,Leonardo," Oh yeah? Let's see how hard you are laughing when my doomsday machine chops off your face! 
",9319449,Farnsworth," Leonardo, stop!  I want in on this!
",3719450,Fry," Are you crazy, Professor?
",2719451,Farnsworth," I hate these nerds. Just because I'm stupider than them, they think they're smarter than me. Kill them all, starting with the math teacher!
",14119452,Farnsworth,"  I knew this final invention would be a humdinger!
",5219453,Leonardo," Yes, we three idiots will finally have our revenge.
",5319454,Fry," I don't think so! You two make me ashamed to call myself an idiot.  There's always going to someone smarter than you, so the only way to be happy is to make the most of what you've got.
",18719455,Leonardo," But you've got nothing.
",2519456,Fry,"Oh no? I've got one single nail and another nail to nail it in with. And I'm gonna stop this infernal ice cream machine once and for all! 
",13919457,Biff," Some doomsday machine! It barely killed anyone!
",4919458,Leonardo," Oh, yeah? Well, take this! 
",2919459,Farnsworth," Oh, my.
",919460,Girl," Poor Leonardo da Vinci. He sure was stupid.
",4519461,Farnsworth," Fry, I admire what you did today, and I'm deeply sorry for insulting your intellect. Your tiny, tiny intellect. Oops, there I go again, you dope. I mean, dummy.
",16219462,Fry," It's okay. I may not be clever, but I have a good heart. That's what my mom used to say.
",9019463,Farnsworth," She was a wise woman.
",2319464,Fry," Also, that I'm not much to look at.
",3719465,Farnsworth," A wise woman, indeed.
",2319466,Farnsworth,"  I fear I may not survive this war reenactment. I can't believe weâ€™re only twelve feet from the parking lot.
",11019467,Fry,"  This is every bit as fun as the real Civil War.
",5019468,Leela," Not the Civil War private. Weâ€™re reinacting the Sith-il War. 
",6319469,Fry," Sith? What the Hoth?
",2219470,Bender," Enemy invaders! Up in yonder sky!
",3519471,Darth Stroyer," I am Darth Stroyer.
",2119472,Fry," Darth Stroyer? Thatâ€™s the stupidest name Iâ€™ve ever heard.
",5919473,Leela," Letâ€™s hear the rest.
",2219474,Darth Trocious," Darth Trocious.
",1719475,Darth Sploder," Darth Sploder.
",1619476,Darth Urderer," Darth Urderer.
",1619477,Darth Ithead," Darth Ithead. 
",1619478,Leela," Company! Attack!
",1819479,Hermes," Donâ€™t fire until you see the greens of their eyes! It saves on bullets.
",7319480,Darth Stroyer," I shall rip out your heart and show it to you!  It is done.
",6119481,Scruffy," The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long.  Mhrm.
",6619482,Darth Sploder," You're dead!
",1419483,Farnsworth," No, I'm just very old. 
",2519484,Darth Sploder,"  Woah! That's good acting!
",2819485,Fry," It's payback time, Sploder! 
",3019486,Darth Sploder," Tell my mother... to pick me up outside Quiznos.
",5019487,Hermes,"  That's three dead. Uh-oh. Let's pick up the pace, people. At this point in the actual war, the death toll was ninety-eight million. 
",13519488,Bender,"  You humans and your fragile organs. One little stab to the goo and 
",7019489,Darth Trocious,"  You're dead, Earth man!
",2619490,Bender,"  Oh, cruel fate, I'm dead. They're putting me in my Sunday suit and shoving me in a wooden box.  Now they're loading me into cold, cold ground. Hello! Here come the worms! 
",17419491,Fry," If you were really dead, you wouldn't be laughing so hard.
",6019492,Bender," Yeah, yeah. Death's a big deal to you flesh bags. But in case you didn't notice, I'm a robot.
",9519493,Fry," So? What if something heavy fell on you, like a church? You could still die.
",7819494,Bender," Nuh-uh! My wireless back-up unit saves a copy of me every day. So, if my body gets killed, big whoop, I just download into another body. I'm immortal, baby!
",15819495,Amy," What? Then how come you always scream so much when you're in danger?
",7019496,Bender," I never said I wasn't a drama queen.
",3819497,Hermes," And the winner of the war is... let me just cross check my tabulation here. Factor in the corsages for the widows.
",11619498,Bender," Hurry up, you number-crunching crumb-nuncher! Everybody but me is dying of old age!
",8519499,Hermes," Okay. The winners, at a net cost of only $12 per life cut tragically short, our Sith Overlords.
",9719500,Darth Sploder," Hot diggity! I mean...  Supreme diggity.
",4219501,Fry," It may have been a fake war, but my scuffed knee is all too real.
",6719502,Farnsworth," I have pain in joints I had removed a century ago. Bender, bring me my soft chair with the wheels on it.
",10619503,Bender," Your wheelchair?
",1819504,Farnsworth," I don't need a wheelchair! The one with the wheels!
",5319505,Bender," Poor flimsy humans. Don't you wish you were flawless like me? A towering inferno of physical perfection?
",10619506,Leela," I hate to pop your blimp-like ego, but you're not perfect.
",6019507,Bender," Am so!
",819508,Leela," Are not!
",1019509,Bender," Is too!
",919510,Leela," Says who?
",1119511,Bender," Says the only human whose opinion I even remotely respect.  Inspector 5, the best inspector a kid could want. The day I was built, he looked me over, probably with tears of pride in his eyes, and proclaimed to all the world, by means of this scrap of paper, that I was perfect and infallible in every way!
",30719512,Farnsworth," Hey, Mr. Perfect? You wet the chair. 
",3919513,Bender," Huh? Wasn't me. Must be some of that urine your all so proud of.
",6619514,Fry,"  That's not urine, it's oil.
",3019515,Bender," Impossible! I'm triple sealed to prevent any chance of ... 
",6119516,Zoidberg," You call that an ink defense?  Goodbye, friends!
",5019517,Bender," What could have caused the leak? Excessive heat, on the count that I'm so hot?
",8019518,Farnsworth," Alas, no. Oh, Bender, I'm afraid it's a symptom of a fatal defect.
",6819519,Bender," Yeah, fatal schmatal. If I die I can just download my backup copy into a new, equally fabulous, body.
",10319520,Farnsworth," That's just it! You can't. You were built without a backup unit.
",6619521,Bender,"  There's no backup copy of me?
",3219522,Farnsworth," That's what I just said, you mortal coil.
",4319523,Bender," So, if I die...
",1719524,Farnsworth," You die. Or as you put it 
",2819525,Bender,"  Um, excuse me for a moment.   No!
",3619526,Bender," I can't believe it! I'm gonna die.
",3619527,Fry," How much time does he have left, Professor?
",4519528,Farnsworth," Between a minute and a billion years.
",3919529,Fry,"  Well, at least you can plan accordingly.
",4319530,Bender," Dying sucks butt! How do you living beings cope with mortality?
",6519531,Leela," Violent outbursts.
",2019532,Amy," General sluttiness.
",2119533,Fry," Thanks to denial, I'm immortal.
",3319534,Bender," Damn it, I'm supposed to be perfect. Inspector 5 gave me his blessing!  How could he bring me into this world knowing I gonna die?
",13219535,Zoidberg," So you wish you were never born, maybe?
",4119536,Bender," Yes, anything less than immortality is a complete waste of time!
",6619537,Zoidberg," Then suicide it is. Step into my office. I'll give you a nice Kervorking.
",7519538,Bender," Not until I hunt down Inspector 5 and beat an explanation out of him!
",7119539,Leela," I'm all for a good beating, but you'll never find him. Product inspectors are bureaucrats, faceless bean counters who blend into the woodwork.
",14419540,Hermes,"  I beg to differ!
",1919541,Bender," Stinking bureaucrats! I hate 'em.
",3519542,Leela," Then again, you might be able to find Inspector 5 with the help of another seasoned bureaucrat.
",9719543,Bender," Hermes, old pal!
",1819544,Hermes," Old pal? 8.5 seconds ago, you said you hated me.
",5019545,Bender," Time heals all wounds.
",2419546,Hermes," You know what? I will help you, but only to prove I'm not just a paper-pushing file-jockey.
",9319547,Amy," Will you be taking your portable filing cabinet?
",5019548,Hermes," None of your beeswax!
",2319549,Hermes," I'll only be away an hour, but I'm counting on you to do the all-critical filing in my absence. Shall we review alphabetical order.  A, B, C, D...
",14819550,Leela,"  Get out of my office!
",2419551,Old Man," Yes. I'd like to request a death certificate. 
",4819552,Woman #1," Sorry. That's Building C.
",2719553,Hermes," The Central Bureaucracy maintains records on all bureaucrats. We should be able to look up Inspector 5.
",10519554,Man #1,"  Application for ingress approved.  And the other potential entrant?
",7019555,Hermes," Uh, he's my pencil sharpener.
",3119556,Bender," You betcha! 
",1419557,Man #1,"  Proceed. 
",1219558,Hermes," I maintain a cubicle here for weekend getaways.
",4919559,Bender," Wow! Until now, I thought giant cubes were exciting.
",5419560,Bender," I did like the part where they screamed.
",4219561,Hermes,"  This is mine. Right next to the center square.
",4919562,Center Square Guy," Sorry, Hermes. I drank all your white-out. 
",4519563,Hermes," Once I log in, I can access Inspector 5's profile.
",5219564,Bender,"  Damn it! It won't go on.
",2719565,Hermes," That's because you're not me. 
",3219566,Bender," Hooray! It won't go on!
",2519567,Hermes," The bureaucra-scan won't let anyone but the assigned bureaucrat log in. 
",7419568,Computer," Identity confirmed. Also, you have a rectangular mass in your colon.
",7019569,Hermes," That's a calculator. I ate it to gain its power.
",5019570,Bender," You locate Inspector 5 while I slip into my ass-kicking feet. 
",6419571,Hermes,"  Sweet File-not-found of Puget Sound! His record's been blanked!
",6619572,Bender," Aw, man! How am I going to find some anonymous guy I don't know anything about?
",8119573,Center Square Guy," I recommend the men's room of the TWA terminal. 
",5019574,Leela," Okay. Just filing alphabetically.  A, B, C, D...  Oh, this requires a little extra thought.  I'm a natural.
",10919575,Hermes," The information we need will be here, in the physical files.
",6219576,Bender,"  Those bastards won't know what leafed through them.  It's on!
",6419577,Hermes,"  No! This is impossible! Quit blacking out and look at this. Inspectors 1, 2, 3, 4... 6. There's no trace of Inspector 5!
",12319578,Bender," But 5's the one we want. Maybe if I kicked the asses of Inspector 2 plus Inspector 3...
",8919579,Hermes," Addition never solve anything, man. Let's cut our losses and go home.
",7119580,Bender," So I'm doomed to die? And I'll never even get to punch whoever's responsible? Oh, what's the point. 
",10219581,Hermes," Bender, no! Suicide isn't necessarily the answer!
",5119582,Bender," It's not a suicide booth, you lard-ass. It's a phone booth. 
",6219583,Hermes," They have phones in booths now? Finally, I don't have to lug this cellphone around. 
",8619584,Mom," Who the hell is this? How did you get this number?
",5219585,Bender," Is this the robot company? Cause I have a complaint about a defective robot. His name is me!
",9419586,Mom," A defective robot, you say?  Stay right there, dearie.  I'll have tech support take care of you. 
",9919587,Bender,"  Well, things are starting to look up.
",4019588,Hermes," Look up!  Who did you call? Dial-a-bomb?
",4219589,Bender," No, I just told the robot company I was defective.
",5219590,Hermes," You dumb cocktail shaker! Mom won't allow a defective product to tarnish her good name! She'll kill you.
",10619591,Bender," Big whoop. I'll just download into a new... Oh, right. If I die, I die. Speaking of whichâ€“  You're right. You're right. You're right. 
",13619592,Mom,"  That's what you get for calling tech support.
",4819593,Bender," I can't run anymore. I'll have to skip. 
",4219594,Hermes," Just a few more feet. We have to get to that pile of dead bears by 7:38.
",7419595,Bender," A pile of dead bears can only mean one thing. But what?
",5719596,Hermes," It's the 7:38! Jump! 
",2319597,Bender," Aw, shoot!
",1219598,Killbot #1," Someone said ""shoot!"" 
",2419599,Bender," Well, we're boned!
",2019600,Hermes," No, we're not! We just go to limbo!
",3719601,Bender," But I'm not design to bend that low, not without limbo music.  That'll do it. Ow! Ow! Ow!
",9119602,Killbot #1 1," We're gonna get fired.
",2419603,Killbot #1 2," Someone said ""fire!"" 
",2319604,Bender,"  We did it!
",1319605,Hermes," Twelve straight hours of limbo. I haven't done that since my honeymoon.
",7319606,Bender," Hermes! Hermes! Remember that flock of bats?
",4619607,Hermes," I sure do.
",1219608,Bender," That was fun.
",1519609,Bender," Where are we?
",1519610,Hermes," I have no idea.
",1719611,Bender," Hey. We're just a stone's throw from Tijuana.  See?
",5319612,Mexican Man #1," Â¡Dios mÃ_o! A rock has fallen here in the outskirts of Tijuana.
",6419613,Bender," Is it within city limits?
",2719614,Mexican Man #1," I think, yes.
",1519615,Bender," Told you!
",1119616,Hermes," Hey, you wanna celebrate our escape? Maybe grab a shot of tequila and take in a big-league cockfight?
",10319617,Bender," Sure. No, wait. I was built in Tijuana. Maybe Inspector 5 still works there. He better do some splaining. Before I mash up some face guacamole.
",14519618,Bender,"  He's Mexican, I'm Mexican. Let me handle this.
",4919619,Mexican border patrolman," Sus papeles, por favor.
",2519620,Bender," Â¡SÃ_!  Ouch-o!
",1519621,Hermes,"  Here are our passports, visas, and Homeland Security permission slips, notarized and starched.
",9719622,Mexican border patrolman,"  Okay. I also would Â¡ave accepted a bribe.
",4419623,Bender," Nice work, butterball. You know, I was in Italy last week. 
",6119624,Bender," My birthplace. It's closed! There's not even a shrine to me. With a gift shop, selling piÃ±atas of me!
",10319625,Hermes," End of the line, man! Come on, we can still catch a twi-night double cockfight.
",8119626,Bender," No wait! What's that in the Mexican garbage?
",4619627,Hermes," Looks like a half-eaten cheese diaper.
",4019628,Bender," No, next to that.  A half-eaten employee directory.  Inspector 5's home address.  His ass-ias is gracias!
",10719629,Bender,"  Where are you hiding, you coward? Get out here and get murdered like a man!
",7819630,Hermes,"  Bender, I'm afraid our search is at an end. He's obviously long gone.
",7219631,Bender," Oh yeah? Well, maybe this is him in a costume.  I'm gonna squeeze you out of there like Tijuana toothpaste.
",10919632,Hermes,"  Okay, Bender, you're mortal. And okay, Inspector 5 screwed up. But that just makes the time you have left all the more precious. Do you really want to waste the rest of your life in a bitter, homicidal rage?
",21019633,Bender,"  No! Yes! I don't know!  Why? Why did he do this to me? All I wanted was a little quality control. But he didn't care enough. And now I gonna die. I deserve better! I'm Bender, damn it! I'm Bender! 
",20019634,Hermes," There, there, mon. It's gonna be okay. You are Bender, which is something Inspector 5 will never be.
",10219635,Bender," You know what? You're right. He was just a stupid bureaucrat. A stupid paper-pushing bureaucrat. A stupid I-dotting, chair squashing,  Oh. No offense, Hermes. You're not like that. I mean, you're exactly like that, but you're okay! In fact, I'm putting you on the do-no-kill list.  Come on, fellow mortal. We're in Tijuana. I wanna live a little.  Help, I'm gonna die! That's the opposite of what I want!
",40619636,Hermes,"  Quick, run out the back! I'll hack into Inspector 5's terminal and fake your death, so they'll call off the Killbots.
",12019637,Bender," You know that terminal's unhackable! I'm not leaving you, and that's final!  Good luck, buddy!
",9619638,Computer," Bender, terminated.
",2119639,Hermes," Bender saved.
",1519640,Killbot #1 2," Cease fire. Mom called off the attack, although I don't see how it's herâ€“
",7519641,Killbot #1 3," Someone said ""howitzer!"" 
",2719642,Bender," Yeah! All right! Yeah!  He did it! And he's not even looking back at that cool explosion! He's a hero!
",10419643,Amy," What's happening? The phone's been disconnected, the ship's been repossessed, and Zoidberg's getting overcooked! 
",11519644,Bender,"  Ah. This place never changes.
",3219645,Hermes," Leela! What in the name of Jah happened?
",4219646,Leela," Too much papers! Not enough hiding plants!
",4419647,Hermes," It's alright. This place just needs a one-hour bureaucratizing.
",6519648,Leela,"  You make it look so easy.
",2819649,Hermes," I've smoked a lot of paperwork in my day.
",4319650,Fry," Hey, Bender. Did you ever find that inspector guy you were looking for?
",7319651,Bender,"  Nah, but thanks to this knucklehead, I did find a new outlook on life. It's precious and sacred, and you only get so many millions of years on this Earth. So let's get brick-faced! 
",18419652,Hermes," 
",219653,Bender," Don't wake up Fry.
",2019654,Bender," My roommate's sleeping.
",2519655,Bender," Wake up already!  I'm about to get down and funky with this ladybot. And I'd appreciate it if as many people as possible could know about it.   Now can we get some privacy?
",17419656,Bender," Ah yeah, backing on up.
",2519657,Bender,"  Hambone! Hambone! Hambone.  Okay, hambone break's over. Back to the bedroom.
",7919658,Bender,"  Hambone! Hambone! Hambone.
",2919659,Bender," Wake up and feel the coffee.
",3019660,Fry," Oh no! I'm late for work again!
",3319661,Fry," Sorry, I'm late.
",1819662,Bender," Well, well, well. Look who decided to show up.
",4819663,Farnsworth," I've had it with your tardiness, Fry. I expect you to arrive the same time as everyone else.
",9419664,Fry," Well, wait a second. Leela's not here yet.
",4419665,Amy," She left a while ago. She said some idiot were taking her to lunch for her birthday.
",8619666,Fry," Oh no! I'm late.
",1819667,Elzar," Since you got stood up, I thought this might cheer you up a notch.
",6819668,Leela," That's not necessary.
",2319669,Elzar,"  What day is today?
It's Leela's birthday
",4319670,Leela," Please stop.
",1419671,Elzar,"  What a day for a birthday
",2819672,Leela," I really would like you to stop singing.
",4219673,Elzar,"  Let's all have some cake.  You want to buy a slice of a birthday cake for 11.95?
",8319674,Leela," Yes, please.
",1419675,Fry," Ooh, nice cake. Sorry, I'm late.
",3419676,Leela,"  Where have youâ€”?  Nah, it's fine.
",3619677,Fry," You're not mad?
",1719678,Leela," I was. But then I realised it's actually my fault for thinking you might be on time for once.  Anyhow, I ate both our lunches. You ordered the Lobster PilÃ©. It wasn't cheap.
",17519679,Elzar," Bam!
",619680,Fry," Please, let me make it up to you. I'll treat you to a fancy birthday dinner tonight at Cavern on the Green.
",10919681,Leela," Wow. That'll be the nicest place I've ever been stood up.
",5919682,Fry," Not this time. No matter what happens, I'll swear I be there.
",6319683,Bender," Guys, guys! Hedonism bot is finally settling down and marrying a nice house in the suburb.  But tonight, he's having the girls gone wildest bachelor party of all time.
",16919684,Fry," Woohoohoohoo...  ... cares? I'm having dinner with Leela.
",5919685,Leela," Just go to your stupid party. We can have dinner on my birthday some other year.
",8219686,Fry," No. I can throw up on a stripper anytime. Tonight, I wanna not throw up. On you.
",8219687,Leela," Really?
",919688,Bender," Your loss.  Hey, Professor, you're my wingman.
",4819689,Farnsworth," Very well. Eh, Cubert, fetch my drinking teeth.
",4919690,Fry," I just have to sign Leela's birthday card. How do you spell XO?
",6519691,Amy," Guh. It's a record-your-own-message card. You don't sign it. You leave a nude video greeting.
",9519692,Fry," Does it have to be nude?
",2619693,Amy," I guess not. That never occurred to me.
",4119694,Fry," If I leave now, record a birthday greeting on the way, score some fancy cologne at the newsstand, I'll be exactly on time!
",12419695,Farnsworth," You're not going anywhere.
",2819696,Fry," But I have a date.
",2019697,Farnsworth," You were late this morning. So you'll have to stay and test my latest invention.  Behold! A time travelling machine!
",11819698,Bender," Time? I can't go back there.
",3019699,Farnsworth," Ah, but this time machine only goes forward in time. That way you can't accidentally change history. Or do something disgusting like sleep with your own grandmother.
",16719700,Fry," I wouldn't wanna do that again.
",3319701,Farnsworth," We're going to test it by going forward in time one minute.  Get in.
",7019702,Fry," Okay, hurry. Let's get it over with. I can record Leela's birthday card while we're in there.
",9519703,Fry,"  Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, 'cause we're testing the professor's dumb time machine.
",12819704,Farnsworth," Okay. I'll just nudge us forward exactly one minute into theâ€”
",6319705,Fry," My card!
",1019706,Fry," Did we go too far? What time is it?
",3719707,Bender,"  The year ten thousand!
",2519708,Farnsworth,"  Whoopsie.
",1219709,Farnsworth," Oh dear. I mean, oh my.
",2519710,Fry," The year ten thousand? But I promised Leela I'll be on time for dinner.
",7319711,Farnsworth," Relax, Fry. Everyone we ever knew died thousands of years ago.
",6419712,Bender," Everyone we ever knew? Nah, I never liked those guys.
",5519713,Fry,"  No! They did it! They blew it up!  And then the apes blew up their society too. How could this happen?  And then the birds took over and ruined their society.  And then the cows. And then...  ... I don't know, is that a slug, maybe?  Noooo!
",24319714,Waiter," While you await your  friend. Allow me to read from a prepared history of our cavern.  These unique rock formations were created over millions of years by mineral rich water dripping from pores in the ceiling. Dripping and dripping.  year on year,  century after century.
",27319715,Elzar,"  What day is today?  Hey, aren't you the loser who got stood up on my other restaurant?
",8919716,Leela," Just shut up and bring me two dinners.
",4019717,Leela," Has anyone seen Fry's ass? It's late for a date with my boot.
",6319718,Cubert," Fry's not here. Obviously he went to that pervert party with Bender and the professor.
",8819719,Leela," Fry went to the party?
",2419720,Linda,"  We interrupt Hypnotoad on Ice to bring you breaking coverage ...  ... of the disaster at Hedonism bot's bachelor party.
",12219721,Morbo,"  Linda, what began as innocent fun ended in tragedy tonight when a nuclear powered robot stripper suffered a catastrophic reactor meltdown. There is only one survivor.
",16919722,Hedonism Bot," Everywhere I looked there were piles of bodies. And then the explosion struck.
",8019723,Zoidberg," The three coworkers I liked... all dead!
",4219724,Leela," Fry stood me up and died?  I'm so angry.  I mean, I'm so sad.  But I'm still pretty angry.  But also sad.  Can I be both?
",12319725,Hermes," It's what he'd want.
",2219726,Leela," Then that's what I am! Hi-yah!
",3219727,Bender," Man, the future is a total craphole. Whoever lives here is a crapface sack of crap.  No offence, fellows.
",10719728,Native #1," Don't sweat it, man.
",2219729,Fry," I'll never see Leela again.
",2919730,Farnsworth," No, without a backwards time machine we're stuck in this craphole.
",6819731,Native #1," Dude, give it a rest.
",2319732,Farnsworth," Hold on! I got it. We can't go back in time, but we can keep going forward until people invent the backwards time machine.
",12419733,Fry," And then we can go home.
",2619734,Bender," Hit it.
",919735,Song,"  In the year one-o-five, one-o-five
If man is still alive
If robot can survive
They may find
 In the year twenty-five twenty-five twenty-five
The backwards time machine still won't have arrived
In all the world, there's only one technology
A rusty sword for practicing proctology
 In the future year that ends with a twenty
A slumpy merman is gonna try to get chummy
He may look like a watery wimp
When in fact he's a blood thirsty schrimp
 In the year one million and a half
Human kind is enslaved by giraffe
Men must pay for all his misdeeds
When the tree tops are stripped off their leaves
Woah-wow
",60319736,Old Hermes," Sometimes I can't believe how successful Planet Express became once the professor was killed and you seized control.
",11819737,Old Leela," There were tough times. But we all pulled together.
",5319738,Old Zoidberg," I've been crunching the numbers on our transgalactic strategyâ€”
",6419739,Old Leela," What are you doing here? I laid you off twenty years ago.
",5919740,Old Zoidberg," Oh, the claws can't flee like they used to.
",4519741,Old Leela," Success is nice, but I do kinda miss the old days.
",5219742,Old Cubert," Hey, Leels.
",1319743,Old Leela," Hi, Cubert.
",1319744,Male inhabitant," May we help you, strange ones?
",3219745,Bender," We are travellers from the past, my good runt.
",4819746,Female inhabitant," I see, since your time, human evolution has diverged.
",5519747,Male inhabitant," There are we; advanced in intellect and morality.
",5119748,Female inhabitant," And the Dumblocks; stupid vicious brutes, who live underground.
",6519749,Farnsworth," Advanced in intellect, you say? Have you invented a backwards time machine?
",7719750,Female inhabitant," No, but if we apply our superior minds, we can perfect such a device within five years.
",8919751,Farnsworth," See you then!
",1519752,Bender," We're back for our time machine.
",3419753,Farnsworth," Yuhoo, boys! What's this era in human history like?
",5319754,Soldier #1 #1," The... the machines, we built them to make our lives easier, but they rebelled. They won't stop until every human is dead.
",12419755,Bender," This seems like a nice future. Let's just stay here. We can settle down on that mountain of skulls.
",10119756,Bender," Hey! That place had a gorgeous view of Blood Lake.
",5219757,Lady #1," Greetings, time travellers.
",2919758,Bender," Stupid jerks wouldn't let me stay in the good future.
",5519759,Fry," How do you know we're time travellers?
",4019760,Lady #2," We too studied the time travel enigma.
",4019761,Lady #3," We have perfected a method using negative mass neutrino fields that allow us to travel backwards in time.
",10719762,Farnsworth," My name's Hubert.
",1919763,Fry,"  All right! We can go home!
",2919764,Bender,"  Nah-nah! We can go...
",2419765,Lady #1," We can talk about our research tomorrow. Men are very rare in our society. Even very old and stupid males are priced.  Tonight, please be the guests of honour at our fertility banquet.
",18619766,Farnsworth," Well, there is certainly no harm in a fertility banquet.
",5819767,Fry," I can eat. And fertilise.
",2719768,Lady #1," Very well, let us anoint our guests in oil without using our hands.
",6919769,Bender,"  Oh, so we can stay in the future you like? But not the future I like? Next!
",7819770,Farnsworth," No! I was about to close the deal.
",3619771,Fry," Bender, they had a backwards time machine.
",4419772,Bender," The other place had a lot of good things too. Did you even see that mountain of skulls?
",8919773,Farnsworth," Why you!
",1019774,Bender," Oh no, you didn't.
",2019775,Fry," Stop. Somewhere, some time, Leela's waiting for me. We need to keep looking for a backwards time machine.
",10719776,Farnsworth," Fry is right.
",1519777,Bender," Yes, we have to work together. Not have this fight which I was definitely winning.
",8419778,Farnsworth," The year one billion.
",2319779,Farnsworth," I got a feeling this could be exactly the point in time we've been looking for.  Nope.  In fact, all life is extinct.
",11919780,Fry," So let's keeping going forward.
",3319781,Farnsworth," Oh, it's no use. Earth is dead. This is the end of all things.
",6419782,Fry," The Cavern on the Green.
",2619783,Fry," I made it, Leela. Sorry, I'm a billion years late.
",5219784,Old Leela," You'll get your alimony cheque, Cubert. Now get lost.
",5519785,Old Cubert," Chill out, I'm just here to see Amy.
",3819786,Old Amy," Move it, boy-toy. Granny's taking you to Atlantic City.
",5719787,Old Hermes," I don't know why you ever married that pig-nose punk.
",5519788,Old Leela," I don't know either. I'm married to the job now.  I used to think there was someone for me, butâ€”  Aw!  How odd, it's one of those old record-your-own-message birthday cards.
",17519789,Fry,"  Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, because we are testing the professor's dumb time machine. But you know, happy birthday and all and...  ... I love you.  My card!
",20119790,Old Leela," My whole life I've been mad at him. And it wasn't his fault.
",6219791,Leela,"  Dear Fry, our time together was short, but it was the best time of my life.
",7819792,Fry," You know, all in all, I had a good life. What you say the three of us grab a six pack and watch the universe end?
",11519793,Farnsworth," Hear, hear!
",1319794,Bender," That's basically what I do every day.
",3919795,Fry," To the end of the universe.
",2919796,Fry," So long, Earth. Thanks for the air and whatnot.
",4919797,Fry," Hey, uh, what was the purpose of life anyway?
",4719798,Farnsworth," Who knows? Probably some hogwash about the human spirit.
",5819799,Bender," Mm-hm.
",819800,Fry," Sounds about right.
",2119801,Farnsworth," The stars are receding. Oh, the vast emptiness.
",4919802,Bender," Yeah, yeah, I can take a hint.
",3219803,Farnsworth," Ah, the last proton should be decaying about now.
",5119804,Fry," Bye, last proton.
",1919805,Farnsworth," And...  ... here we are; the end of the universe.
",5119806,Fry," Well, now what? You guys wanna talk?
",3819807,Bender," No thanks.
",1219808,Fry," Did anyone else see that?
",2719809,Farnsworth," Unbelievable. It's a second big bang.  My God, is it possible?
",6419810,Fry," It must be possible. It's happening. By the way, what's happening?
",6819811,Farnsworth," It appears, this universe is exactly identical to the old one. If so, we just need to keep going forward in time to the point when we left.  The Earth is born!  Ladies and gentlemen, the moon.
",19419812,Fry," Look. The first fish to crawl up on land.
",4319813,Bender,"  It was coming right at us.
",2919814,Bender," You saw it.
",1319815,Fry," I'm gonna grab another beer.
",3019816,Bender," Fry, Fry, you're missing the dinosaurs.
",4119817,Fry," It's okay. They're not going anywhere.  Where'd they go?
",5819818,Bender," Now what's going on there?
",2819819,Fry," History.
",1019820,Farnsworth," Hang on, I just want to make one stop.
",4019821,Hitler," Betrachten Sie meinen Schnurrbart.
",3619822,Farnsworth," Easy. Easy. Taking her in for a landing.
",4219823,Farnsworth," One year to go.  Six months.
",3019824,Fry," I'm almost there, Leela.
",2619825,Farnsworth," One month.  Two weeks.  One hour.  Thirty seconds and here weâ€”
",6419826,Fry," Stop!
",719827,Bender," Give me the keys, Magoo.
",2619828,Farnsworth," We'll have to bring her around again.
",3919829,Farnsworth," Just slow it down, I'll shoot Hitler out the window.  Darn! I hit Eleanor Roosevelt by mistake.  Okay. Nearing our era again.  Here we go.  Careful this time.  Careful.
",17019830,New Farnsworth," We're going to test it by going forward in time one minute.  Get in.
",7019831,New Fry," Okay, hurry, let's get it over with.
",3819832,New Farnsworth," But, err, whaâ€“?
",1719833,Farnsworth," Oh uh.
",819834,Farnsworth," This new universe is about ten feet lower than our old one.
",6119835,Farnsworth," Pow. We took care of the time travel paradox.
",4719836,Fry," All right!
",1219837,Bender," Yabba dabba doo.
",1819838,Fry," Oh uh, I'm late for dinner with Leela.
",4019839,Waiter," Welcome to Cavern on the Green. May I offer you some meatloaf while you wait?
",7919840,Fry," Sorry, I'm late.
",1819841,Leela," Actually, you're on time.
",2719842,Fry," Really?
",919843,Leela," I have to admit, I was afraid you wouldn't make it.
",5319844,Fry," That was the old Fry. He's dead now.
",3819845,Fry," Happy birthday, Leela. I got you a card, but I guess I kinda lost it.
",7119846,Leela," That's okay. I don't really like cards. What I'll remember is our time together.
",8219847,Leela," Aw! Nibbler made a bobo for Mamma. I'll pick it up with my super-dupey poopy scoopy. 
",8719848,Amy," Core magnetic field, 31 microteslas.
",3819849,Prof. Farnsworth," Nice.
",719850,Amy," Temperature? Woah! The magma P.I. is 10,000 degrees Selleck!  Leela, I am collecting data. Can't you dump that somewhere else?
",12819851,Leela," Not really. It's highly volatile Dark Matter, and some corn.
",6219852,Amy," But I'm presenting my thesis tomorrow and I've barely had time to prepare.
",7619853,Farnsworth," Nonsense. You've been my grad student for twelve years. You were ready six years ago.
",8719854,Amy," What?
",719855,Farnsworth," I probably should have told you. Anyway, the important thing is to be relaxed tomorrow.
",8919856,Amy," Are you sure?
",1519857,Farnsworth," Yes. Do what you young people do to unwind. Take a joyride in your jalopy. Wear a T-shirt and eat a fish stick. Go!
",11719858,Kif," Okay, amigos, one teensy drink to help Amy relax. 
",5219859,Amy," Hmmm. I guess I'm still kinda nervous.
",4019860,Leela," One more teensy drink to help Amy relax. 
",4319861,Fry," Still a little nervous? 
",2619862,Bender," She's a nervous wreck! 
",2519863,Leela,"  Well, I may not have a man, but at least I've got you, poopsie-doodle. 
",7419864,Nibbler,"  Leela, it's time you and I had a talk.
",4119865,Leela," A talk? You can't break up with me. You're my pet!
",5219866,Nibbler," As much as I enjoy being the object of your misplaced affections, I am also a highly sophisticated being who longs for intelligent conversation.
",14619867,Leela," Aw, is shnookums not feeling schtimuwated?
",4419868,Nibbler," An understatement, to say the least. It's time you treated me with respect.
",7719869,Leela," If you want to be treated like a fellow crew member, fine, but no more purse rides, and no more dressing you up in your cute little sailor suit.
",14619870,Nibbler," I keep telling you, that's my real naval uniform.
",5119871,Kif," Your place or mine?
",2119872,Amy," Both, but first, this place. 
",3119873,Hedonism Bot,"  Ooh! Room for one more? 
",2719874,Amy," I thought I set you for 7:15!
",3119875,Alarm Clock," Sorry, I hooked up with Bender last night. Dude was all over my snooze button.
",8019876,Amy," But my doctoral exam is in ten minutes! On Mars!  Eww! Kif, did you yack on the floor?
",8819877,Kif,"  Yes, I did.
",1419878,Katz," Where's your candidate, Farnsworth? I have a long list of students to humiliate today.  You're late, Miss Wong.
",11319879,Amy," Oh, God, this is like one of those nightmares. 
",4919880,Farnsworth," Here, take my lab coat. 
",2619881,Katz," Allow me to introduce your examining committee in descending  order of grumpiness. Professor Ogden Wernstrom.
",11119882,Farnsworth," Wernstrom!
",1219883,Katz," Downtown Professor of Applied Physics, Ethan 'Bubblegum' Tate.
",6419884,Tate," I see by your curriculum vitÃ_ that you're a Sagittarius.
",5819885,Katz," And Professor Fisherprice Shpeekenshpell.
",4319886,Shpeekenshpell," The cow says... Moo.
",2219887,Farnsworth,"  He proved that 50 years ago, and he's been coasting on it ever since.
",7219888,Katz," I am the esteemed Professor Morris Katz, and you are wasting my time. Proceed.
",8019889,Amy," Imagine, if you will...
",2519890,Katz," Oh, God!
",1019891,Amy," A gigantic spherical generator, one that could provide unlimited energy, because it's essentially in Perpetual Motion.
",12019892,Wernstrom,"  Young lady, have you been drinking?
",3819893,Amy," Well, yes, but that's not revelant. I'm talking about Earth. Earth's the generator.  Suppose this basketball is the whole world.
",13019894,Tate,"  To many young men in the inner city, it is.
",4619895,Amy," As it spins, it's producing an enormous magnetic field. If we could use that field to generate electric current, we could actually harness the Earth's rotational ener... Ener... 
",18019896,Farnsworth," Yes, tapping the Earth's ener-kerchoo. Go on.
",4719897,Amy," Sorry, I'm super-allergic to cats. Professor Katz, would you mind.
",6819898,Katz," Miss Wong, I mind everything.
",3119899,Amy,"  You just need to polarize the Earth's core with a huge static charge,  by ratcheting Superconducting wire down into...  Sorry.
",12919900,Katz," Enough. The committee members will now vote yea or nay. Nay.
",6219901,Wernstrom," Nay.
",619902,Tate," Hell nay.
",1119903,Shpeekenshpell,"  The horse says, doctorate denied.
",3619904,Fry," It's okay, Amy. I don't have a fancy degree either, but today I'm a prominent boy in the package delivery field. 
",11519905,Nibbler," Now that I'm a full and equal member of the crew, I pledge my loyalty, my perspicacity, and, dare I say it, my friendship.
",12419906,Hermes," Leela, muzzle that skunk! We can't stop a meeting for some cute, fuzzy, little...  Hey, look, a kitty cat.
",10819907,Amy,"  You again?  Get away you mangy ball of Histamines.
",5319908,Hermes,"  You leave kitty cat alone! 
",3019909,Farnsworth," People, please, I'm trying to run a business, so I get to hold kitty. 
",7219910,Fry," Over here. I wanna hold him.
",3019911,Bender," Aw! Its anus looks like an asterisk.
",3819912,Leela," Captain Fuzzytoes reporting for duty. I mean, cutie. 
",5519913,Nibbler,"  My best friend died in that uniform. I hate that cat!
",5619914,Amy," If I had a spray bottle, I'd give him such a spritzing.
",5719915,Nibbler," I'll tell you one thing. Nothing acts that cute without some ulterior motive. 
",8019916,Amy," Aw! You want your diapey changed? 
",3619917,Nibbler,"  We'll have to watch its every move.  Powder, please.
",5519918,Amy," Here's my new theory. That is one adorable cat.
",4919919,Nibbler," I guess I was just jealous. I do miss being Leela's schnookums. I'm going to apologize and hope for a pity pet. 
",11419920,Leela,"  Yes, my lord. Amy and Nibbler are a tewwible thweat. They must be spayed and neutered, wespectivewy. 
",10419921,Amy,"  The cat is evil! We have proof!
",3419922,Nibbler," It was summoning a saucer!
",2819923,Farnsworth," Of course it wanted a saucer, you idiot. A saucer of dewicious cweam. 
",7219924,Nibbler," You fool, this isn't about the cream.
",3919925,Bender," It's pwonounced ""cweam"". 
",2719926,Zoidberg," I'm petting mine down to the bone. 
",3719927,Fry," Just stwoke its fwffy fur.
",2819928,Hermes," Scwatch its fwubby chin.
",2619929,Bender," Fweeble its fwooby pwow.
",2619930,Amy," No, no! 
",1019931,Nibbler," What do cats need with that much yarn and cobalt?
",5119932,Amy," They're doing something downstairs. We've got to find out what. 
",6619933,Bender," Where do you think you're going, no-cat?
",4219934,Amy," Uh, the basement. I think I left the air hockey table on.
",5919935,Bender," Without a cat, you ain't going nowhere. 
",4219936,Nibbler," Can you at least tell us what's going on down there?
",5419937,Farnsworth," We're certainly not building something sinister, if that's what your implying. Now, come on, Bender. Something sinister won't build itself. 
",14219938,Amy," Professor Katz's last name is Katz. Do you think he has something to do with these cats?
",9019939,Nibbler," The conclusion is an inescapable as it is moronic.  I say we pay him a visit, and if he won't talk to us, he'll talk to Smith & Wesson,  or, perhaps, Consolidated Head Melter. 
",17819940,Amy,"  Professor Katz, we want answers! 
",3619941,Nibbler," I warn you, if I have to get cute, it's gonna get ugly. 
",5819942,Amy," He's dead!
",1219943,Nibbler," Wait. What are these strings on his lap?  What the... He isn't dead. He's one of those dog-operated puppets that's been adapted for use by a cat!
",14719944,Amy," So I had my doctorate denied by that fuzzball?  Bad kitty!
",6019945,Amy," They actually built the planetary ratchet from my thesis!  Uh-oh.
",6719946,Nibbler," What the... 
",1419947,Thubanian Leader," Well, look what the me dragged in.
",3619948,Nibbler," You can talk!
",1519949,Thubanian Leader," You can talk?
",1519950,Nibbler," How ironic. Two hyper-intelligent beings both pretending to be simple house pets!
",8319951,Thubanian Leader," Say, do you know Obliteron? He pretends to be a hamster, but...
",6519952,Amy," Yeah, that's really great. Could you please tell us what's going on?
",7019953,Thubanian Leader," What? Oh, right! You see, my associates and I are from the ninth planet of the star you call Thuban. Long ago, life there was ideal.  Our sun provided plenty of warm, dozy light. The chicken-salmon roamed free.  Yet disaster loomed. Our planet's rotation was gradually slowing.  At first, it seemed beneficial. Long, dark nights for sleeping, long, sunny days for sleeping. But then it got too hot and too cold.  Our top scientists went to work,  At last, they located a planet with the necessary orientation and magnetic field to harness the rotational energy. 
",56419954,Nibbler," Earth!
",819955,Thubanian Leader," Indubitably. Although we call it Blue Blue Shiny Ball.  In the area now known as Egypt, my people constructed a giant, semi-octahedral antenna to beam Earth's rotational energy to Thuban. 
",19019956,Amy," The Great Pyramid at Giza!
",2819957,Thubanian Leader," Yes. The Egyptians viewed us as gods, but ironically that was our downfall.  They pampered us with feasts most fancy and vittles most tender. We grew fat and domesticated.  Thousands of years passed, and our home world was nearing total destruction.  But the technology to save our planet was lost. Lost, that is, until I heard you speak at Mars University.
",35919958,Amy," So you called my thesis a fat sack of barf, and then you stole it?
",6819959,Thubanian Leader," Welcome to Academia.
",2219960,Nibbler," He intends to siphon off Earth's rotational energy!
",5319961,Amy," Earth will come to a stop, and...
",3519962,Thubanian Leader," Half of you will cook, and half of you will freeze. Earth will be one big McDLT. We just got that commercial last year.
",12119963,Amy," Oh, yeah, smarty paws? You may have built the ratchet but you can't reach the core without 4,000 miles of superconducting wire.  The ball of yarn! 
",14919964,Thubanian Leader," Quite.
",819965,Nibbler," Even so, you'd still need a tremendously powerful static charge to trigger the process.
",8919966,Thubanian Leader," Ever had a cat rub up against you?
",3619967,Nibbler," If you're propositioning me, I'm not interested.
",5019968,Thubanian Leader," I'm talking about the charge generated when 50,000 felines rub against a single surface. Professor?
",10119969,Thubanian Leader," Soon the world will come to a stop, and there's nothing you can do to stop it. The stopping of the world, that is. It's unstoppable.  Excuse me. 
",14719970,Thubanian Leader," The Earth is coming to a stop. Keep your eyes on the kitties and push! 
",7319971,Nibbler,"  These space cats seem to be employing some form of hypnotic hyper-cuteness. Well, two can play that game. And one of them is me. 
",13219972,Leela," Nibbler? Poopsie-doodle? 
",2719973,Thubanian Leader," Mr. Winkles, Smudge-Smudge. Quick, dance with each other.
",5919974,Nibbler," Aw!  Damn, they are good.
",2719975,Thubanian Leader," We're coming to a full stop. All cats, to your posts!
",5519976,Calculon," Catastrophe Beach Party. Scene One. Cue disaster effects, and action! 
",7219977,Calculon," Cut! That extra looked at the camera. We'll have to do it again.
",6619978,Thubanian Leader," And now to transfer your planet's rotational energy to my home world. 
",7219979,Thubanian,"  Well, now, this calls for a celebration. 
",4419980,Hermes," What's all this cat hair on my sweater? 
",4219981,Bender," And why am I full of sand? And Tootsie Rolls?
",4719982,Nibbler," You were all under the spell of those obnoxious space cats.
",6119983,Thubanian Leader,"  Enjoy being broiled alive by the Sun and also the dead bird we've left in your slipper. 
",9119984,Farnsworth," Quickly! If we turn the ratchet the other way, perhaps we can restart the Earth. 
",8319985,Hermes," It won't turn. Push harder, Bender!
",3719986,Bender," I can't. You should have called my cousin, Turner.
",5219987,Amy," It's hopeless. Even in theory the device can only apply force in one direction.
",8119988,Fry," Can someone open a window? It's getting a little warm in here.
",6419989,Bender,"  Is that better?
",1819990,Amy," Shmezzus, it's hot! Why'd I have to invent that awful device?
",6319991,Farnsworth," Amy, technology isn't intrinsically good or evil. It's how it's used. Like the death ray.
",9119992,Amy," Maybe you're right. I guess that science has to keep pushing forward with the hope that...  That's it! Pushing forward! Professor, I know how to restart the Earth.
",16519993,Farnsworth,"  You can't suddenly know something just by assembling a committee of words.  That's it. I'll assemble your committee!
",11919994,Amy," The ratchet won't turn backwards, but what if we kept pushing it forward?  Earth would start turning again.
",10919995,Wernstrom," Yes, the wrong direction! 
",2819996,Amy," So?
",519997,Tate," Gentlemen,  ladies,  let's get this globe trotting.
",5319998,Amy,"  It's working! Just a little faster!
",3819999,Zoidberg," But we're plotzing here!
",2620000,Amy," Then look at Nibbler! 
",2420001,Thubanian Leader,"  On the whole, Earth's society is worthless. But they do these things called antique rugs that are great for peeing on. 
",12220002,Farnsworth," And though the world is now spinning in the wrong direction, it's good enough. Well done, Amy.
",9620003,Wernstrom," I'm honored to begrudgingly present you with your Ph.D. in applied physics.
",7720004,Tate," Also, some kind of sportsmanship award I had in my glove compartment.
",7120005,Amy," Yay! I'm finally done with school. How's the job market?
",5820006,Shpeekenshpell,"  Ruff!
",820007,Farnsworth," Congratulations, Dr. Wong!
",2820008,Kif," Congratulations.
",1820009,Nibbler,"  Permission to come aboard?
",2920010,Leela," Granted, schnookums. 
",2320011,Farnsworth," You've got a bright future, Amy. As sure as the Sun sets in the east.
",7120012,Hermes," Item one... Duck! 
",2020013,Prof. Farnsworth," Cubert, you crapscallion! What aren't you in school?
",5420014,Cubert," I couldn't get past the protesters. A bunch of smiling, angry people were handing out these anti-evolution flyers.
",11620015,Farnsworth,"  Evolution is under attack in our schools? To the science mobile.
",6720016,Leela," You mean the ship?
",2020017,Farnsworth," Yes. The science mobile!
",2620018,Leela," It's just that you've never called it that before, but okay.
",6220019,Woman #1," I don't understand evolution, and I have to protect my kids from understanding it! We will not give in to the thinkers!
",12120020,Farnsworth,"  You people are as loud as you are ignorant. Now, get back on your turnip trucks and go home!
",9520021,Hydroponic Farmer,"  That is an insultingly accurate stereotype, sir!
",5120022,Farnsworth," As a professor of science, I assure you that we did, in fact, evolve from filthy monkey-men.
",9420023,Dr. Banjo," I cannot speak for you, sir, but my ancestors were not monkeys. They were orangutans. Hard-working, patriotic orangutans.
",12320024,Farnsworth," Dr. Banjo?
",1220025,Dr. Banjo," In the fur. And I remind you that evolution is merely a theory. Like gravity, or the shape of the Earth.
",10620026,Flying Spaghetti Monster," Hey, Professor, I'm a Flying Spaghetti Monster. You seriously believe I've descended from some kind of flightless manicotti?
",12620027,Farnsworth," Yes!
",620028,Banjo," Oh, please. A far more logical explanation is the undisprovable science of Creatureism. All life was created in its present form seven thousand years ago, by a fantastical creature from outer space!
",20020029,Farnsworth," Bunk!
",720030,Banjo," Oh!  If you elitist, East Coast evolution is real, why has no one found the missing link between modern humans and ancient apes?
",13020031,Farnsworth," We did find it!  It's called Homo erectus!
",4420032,Banjo," Then you have proven my case, sir, for no one has found a link between apes and this Homo erectus. 
",10120033,Farnsworth," Yes, they have!  It's called Homo habilis!
",4420034,Banjo," Ah-ha! But no one has found the missing link between ape and this so called Homo habilis.
",9120035,Farnsworth," Yes, they have!  It's called Australopithecus africanus!
",5820036,Banjo," Oh-ho! I've got you now!  Fair enough, but where, then, is the missing link between apes and this Darwinius masillae? Answer me that, Professor!
",14620037,Farnsworth," Okay, granted, that one missing link is still missing, but just because we haven't found it doesn't mean it doesn't exist!
",12420038,Banjo,"  Things don't exist simply because you believe in them. Thus sayeth the Almighty Creature in the Sky!
",10320039,Farnsworth," I'll show that banana-swilling, poop-slinger! We just need to find that last missing link.
",9220040,Leela," I found a missing link. It seems to be half-man, half-toucan. 
",6420041,Farnsworth," Not what we're looking for. Throw it in the soup! 
",5220042,Hermes," And here's something.  Uh-oh. It's another one of Fry's dogs.
",6320043,Fry," Did you find something, Hermes?
",3320044,Hermes,"  No. 
",720045,Amy," I hate chiseling right after a manicure. Oh! Darn it! I broke off one of my fingers!
",8620046,Zoidberg,"  Look, Cubert. The neck on this one. I bet he spent a fortune on ties!  What, too soon?
",8920047,Cubert," I highly doubt a Jurassic Elaphrosaurus has access to neckwear.
",6520048,Zoidberg," I knew I should have gone with the ring-around-the-collar joke.
",6520049,Bender," Hey, look! I found a robot fossil! 
",3720050,Farnsworth," That's a bedspring, you dumb bedspring! There are no robot fossils!
",6920051,Bender," What? Who says I didn't evolve?
",3320052,Farnsworth," Everybody! Robots were created quite recently. It was in all the papers.
",7420053,Bender," Then explain this! 
",2120054,Farnsworth," I've hit a rich vein of missing links. Java Man, Piltdown Man, Manfred Mann.  Eureka!  It's the elusive missing missing link! This will show Banjo, once and for all!
",16720055,Fry,"  What the...
",1420056,Amy," Oh, that's mine. 
",1920057,Bender,"  Hmm, my tux doesn't fit. Probably because I've grown so much since I last wore it, or evolved, one might say.
",11220058,Farnsworth," One might not say that! Your tux doesn't fit because you stole it from a boy!
",7920059,Bender," You mean a man! It was his Bar Mitzvah.
",4120060,Ben Bee #1ler," Welcome, museum members. Or, as I like to call you, future exhibits. 
",7120061,Zoidberg,"  He's good.
",1320062,Bee #1ler," Tonight, we have a new resident here in the hall of Hominids, generously donated by its discoverer, Hubert Farnsworth. Ladies and gentlemen, Homo farnsworth. 
",16020063,Farnsworth," Once again, science saves the day. The end.
",4520064,Bee #1ler," And now, to discuss the scientific implications of this discovery, our new museum curator, Dr. Banjo!
",10320065,Banjo," Thank you Professor Farnsworth, for your generous gift, which has, once and for all dis-proven evolution.  Behold! Homo farnsworth frolicking with dinosaurs at the moment of creation.
",18520066,Farnsworth," I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
",4620067,Farnsworth," Faster! Faster! Just drop me off at that asteroid over there.
",6320068,Leela," Wow, this planetoid is completely lifeless.
",4520069,Farnsworth," Not lifeless enough! Set up my shack so that I can kick you out of it!
",7220070,Fry,"  Professor, is this your only water source? It looks like Diet Dr. Pepper.
",7620071,Farnsworth," It's not that bad. It's just laden with toxic minerals. But not for long. 
",7620072,Fry," What's in the tube?
",2120073,Farnsworth," Microscopic Nanobots.  They're tiny robots I designed to eat up nasty irritants.
",8220074,Fry," Speaking of nasty irritants, what's going to become of Cubert?
",6420075,Farnsworth," Who? Oh, my son. Don't worry, he's been safely abandoned with his godfather.
",7820076,Zoidberg," Cubert,  I felt we needed some father-son bonding time, so I found a couple of  baseball gloves and boiled them up for lunch.
",12720077,Cubert," Why don't you just go to Hell!
",3220078,Zoidberg," Wait! We still have to discuss the facts of life. What are they?
",6620079,Hermes,"  Okay, I finished moving the last grand piano. Now can we have our pizza?
",7520080,Farnsworth," You'll get your damned pizza, you parasite! First, let see if my Nanobots have purified the water yet.  Ah, the water's as sterile as my milkman-trusting father. But what's this? The Nanobots have gotten more complex.
",21920081,Bender," What's that you say? Those robots have evolved all by themselves, you say?
",7620082,Farnsworth," It wasn't by themselves! I put them there. I'm a genius. Get over it!
",7120083,Amy," Hey look, now they gotten bigger. 
",3620084,Farnsworth," Good heavens! Trilobots!
",2620085,Leela," Oh, no! My sunglasses were in there!
",3820086,Hermes," Let's get the pizza out of here. 
",3520087,Amy," Look, there's a cave-like hole in that mountain. It might be a cave. 
",7120088,Leela," Does anyone have a lighter?
",2920089,Bender," Hang on. 
",1120090,Leela," Okay, we've got shelter and just enough precious food to ward off starvation.
",7920091,Hermes," It's pizza time. 
",1920092,Amy," Pineapple?
",1220093,Hermes," So much for that. 
",2020094,Zoidberg," Hello, I remembered you like superheroes so I painted you a mural on your wall.  This is Father-Man. He fights crime to earn Son-Boy's respect. Is it working?
",16020095,Cubert," This is sucky! You suck! Who taught you to do three-point perspective? I could make a better mural with my butt!
",11420096,Zoidberg,"  Father-Man away. 
",2020097,Hermes," Nothing like a cave for a good night's sleep. So what do we have to eat that's not poisoned with pineapple?
",10920098,Farnsworth," I packed plenty of food, but it's all in dehydrated pill form. 
",6520099,Leela," Then we need water from that pond. We'll have to fight our way past the Trilobots.  Go! Go! Hit anything that moves!
",11820100,Fry," Whoa.
",720101,Bender," Wow.
",620102,Amy," A whole forest grew overnight.
",3220103,Farnsworth,"  All these trees are robotic. I can't believe how quickly they sprung up.
",7520104,Bender," I can. Robots do everything faster. Including evolving and believing how quickly things spring up.
",10020105,Leela,"  One thing about Bristol-Myers Squibb, they know how to cook a steak. 
",7220106,Fry,"  Look at me, I'm the Ty-D-Bol man. I own a yacht an everyone poops on me.  Help! Police!
",9020107,Leela," Everybody grab a club. 
",2520108,Fry,"  Oh, big, tough water guy, why don't you come up here on land and... 
",7120109,Amy," Look out for the next thing!
",3020110,Farnsworth," Great Scott, a Tricycle-tops!
",3120111,Fry," Woo-hoo! Throw down dinosaurs of the land and sea.  This is a cool way to die!
",8020112,Cubert," Dr. Zoidberg? I'm sorry for treating you like a total Zoidberg... I mean, loser. 
",8320113,Zoidberg," Go on.
",820114,Cubert," It's just that I get bullied a lot. I guess I kinda make fun of people as a defense mechanism.
",9620115,Brettt Blob," Hey, Cubert, is that your family mansion? 
",4420116,Cubert," Why don't you ask your mom? She's coming over for a sex visit.
",6420117,Zoidberg," Don't worry, I know just how to handle bullies. Just pretend like you're pathetic. Help, I'm scared. I wet myself. I'm crying like a baby and I'm soaking in pee, but what else is new? 
",18620118,Brettt,"  The pee-babies peed themselves. I'm off to pottery class, dorkwads.
",7020119,Zoidberg," And that's that.
",1820120,Cubert," Woah! You're like some kind of dumpster Jedi.
",4720121,Zoidberg," So, you wanna come in maybe?  I've got a nice pound cake with a footprint on it.
",8220122,Fry,"  Ah! Don't eat my butt!
",2520123,Leela," If this is anything like killing that pigeon on my balcony, we've got our work cut out for us.
",9620124,Farnsworth," Look out, a solar flare!
",2620125,Amy," What the shmell happened?
",2720126,Farnsworth," A mass extinction.  That solar flare created a huge electromagnetic pulse that while harmless to organic life, short-circuited the robo-dinosaurs.
",14820127,Leela," Convenient.
",1320128,Farnsworth," Only puny, mammal-like robots cowering in caves could survive such a catastrophe.
",8320129,Bender," Guys, guys! I taught myself to knit.
",3820130,Farnsworth," Wait a moment. If we could scavenge the right parts from these robo-dinos, I might be able to construct a rudimentary spaceship to get us off this planet!
",15620131,Farnsworth," Oh, well, it took almost two hours, but it's finished.  Now let's go... to sleep. It's solar powered, so we can't take off until sunrise.
",13920132,Bender," Well, let's find something comfy to bed down on. 
",5120133,Fry," Hey, looky here. 
",1920134,Hermes," Sweet robot swan of Botswana!
",3120135,Bender," Looks like the fittest did a little surviving last night, huh?
",6420136,Farnsworth," Whatever.
",1120137,Fry," Hey, looky there. 
",2020138,Hermes," Those robo-cavemen have kidnapped our human regular-women!
",6020139,Fry," We gotta save them! But the only weapon we have is my fan dance. 
",6720140,Farnsworth," Hmm, I believe I can fashion a slingshot using this robot wishbone and this elastic from my pants. 
",10120141,Amy," I think they want wives, so just play along. If it doesn't work out, we'll still get half their rocks.
",10420142,Leela," I can earn my own rocks! Also, I don't want any rocks!
",5620143,Farnsworth," Well, it took almost twelve hours, but it's finished.
",5520144,Hermes," It's too dark now, but first thing tomorrow we'll slingshot them like they've never been slangshat. 
",10220145,Fry," What's going on? How did we save you?
",3920146,Amy," It was the weirdest thing. We went to sleep, and when we woke up, our cave husbands were gone.
",9620147,Leela," I'm gonna miss Spencer.
",2520148,Dr. Widnar," Don't be afraid, little guys. I'm not gonna hurt you. 
",5620149,Fry,"  Nice net.
",1220150,Widnar," You... you can speak?
",2320151,Hermes," Dread my locks! A fully-evolved robot human.
",4620152,Widnar," I'm Dr. Widnar, a naturalist.
",3120153,Bender," And I'm Bender, baby. My human slaves and I come from a planet where organic life and robotic life evolved side by side.
",12220154,Farnsworth," Oh, shut up!
",1420155,Widnar," Amazing.  I've theorized that carbon-based, fat-filled life could exist, but until today, I never had any proof.
",11420156,Leela," Good for you. Can we go home now? 
",3620157,Widnar," Welcome, museum members, or, as I like to call you, future exhibits.  I now present my latest discovery, the amazing non-mechanical man, Homo farnsworth.
",15520158,Farnsworth," Thank you. I must say, I'm so proud to see what you've blossomed into since I first created your ancestors.
",10920159,Widnar," What?
",720160,Farnsworth," I thought you knew. You all evolved from some filth-gobbling Nanobots I designed. I dumped them in one of your ponds a few days ago.
",13420161,Widnar," But this is Creationist talk!
",3120162,Robot #1 Farnsworth," He speaks lies! The Earth was created in eons not days.
",5720163,Farnsworth," Yes, relative to you, it was eons, but, well, look at this hologram I took the day before yesterday of a robot frolicking with a robo-dinosaur. 
",14620164,Widnar," I don't want to live on this planet anymore! 
",4720165,Robo-Police," You're under arrest for crimes against science.
",4920166,Robot #1," Go back to Roboklahoma!
",2520167,Superior Gort Judge #1," Order! In the matter of Everyone v. Farnsworth, the alleged creationist faces a sentence of death by melting. Who is representing the accused?
",14420168,Leela," I am...
",920169,Bender," I am, your Honor. 
",2020170,Farnsworth," Bender, what the Hell are you doing?
",3820171,Bender," Shut up, I'm billing you by the hour! Besides, I'm a robot, they'll listen to me.  Ladytrons and gentlebots...
",11220172,Superior Gort Prosecutor," Objection. In the absence of pants, defense's suspenders serve no purpose.
",7620173,Superior Gort Judge #1," I'm going to allow them, for now.
",3520174,Bender," Thank you. Your Honor, this meat-man does not deny that we robots are the glorious products of evolution. He claim only to have played a small role in supplying the initial machinery. I ask you, is that so crazy? Yes, it's completely crazy, and that is why you must find him not guilty by reason of insanity! 
",31120175,Farnsworth," Objection, I'm not crazy! I created you all and I came here in a homemade spaceship and lived in a cave. If you don't believe me, ask my uncle.
",14520176,Superior Gort Judge #1," Prosecutor, your opening statement?
",3720177,Superior Gort Prosecutor,"   Yeah, honey. I'll be home by dinner.   The prosecution rests, your Honor.
",7720178,Superior Gort Judge #1," Very well, we will reconvene when the jury reaches a verdict.
",6320179,Bender,"  Son, you in a whole mess of trouble.
",3920180,Superior Gort Judge #1," Has the jury reached a verdict?
",3320181,Robot #1ic gas forms," No, we have not, for we have evolved to a high state of consciousness.  In the grand scheme, all physical beings are but yokels. Now, settle your petty squabbles and get the hell out. 
",18620182,Bender,"  That'll be $10,000.
",2220183,Banjo," Well, digital photographs don't lie. I admit that what you witnessed may have been some form of evolution.
",10820184,Farnsworth," I'm glad you agree, Dr. Banjo.
",3220185,Banjo," Evolution set into motion by a wise and all-knowing Creator. You.
",6720186,Farnsworth,"  Well I don't know about all-knowing. And I admit it's possible, however unlikely, that some wise and all-knowing alien monster set evolution in motion here on Earth.
",16820187,Bender," And the Creator could also be a robot.
",4020188,Farnsworth," Then who built this so-called Creator-robot?
",4620189,Banjo," Some magical bearded robot in the sky? 
",4120190,Bender," I guess that would be stupid. Never mind.
",4320191,Farnsworth," Then it's settled. Finally, a world in which I'm happy to raise my son!
",7320192,Zoidberg," Good, cause I'm sick of him!
",3020193,Zoidberg,"  I'm serious. He's a terrible person.
",3920194,Linda," Tonight, at
",1320195,Morbo," Doom!
",720196,Leela," Boy, that thing's big. Fry, is my colossal eye too big?
",5720197,Fry," No, it's what makes you you.
",3020198,Leela," But it's so round, so hideously round.
",4020199,Fry," Leela, listen. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever known.
",6520200,Leela," Oh. So you only care about my looks?
",3820201,Fry," No, I.... What?
",1720202,Linda,"  Finally, New New York got a blast of class today as Nikolai, playboy ruler of the Robo-Hungarian Empire, arrived aboard his extravagant, caviar-powered yacht.
",16120203,Nikolai,"  I'm just a humble emperor, with a big, big crown!
",5220204,Bender,"  Of course I'm not planning to steal that crown!
",5020205,Leela," What?
",720206,Bender," True. I've always dreamt of being an emperor. You know, for Halloween, and then forever. But heisting those jewels would be difficult.
",13620207,Leela," You'd be stupid to try.
",2520208,Bender," I'll need accomplices. A sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard.
",7020209,Amy," Never! 
",920210,Bender," A claw man to slip past the metal detector and cut the alarm wires.
",6920211,Zoidberg," Sorry, I'm set for life after that last job. 
",4720212,Bender," And finally, a chump, to be caught on video and later arrested.
",6520213,Fry," As I told you on Sucker-Punch Day, I'm through being a chump.
",6320214,Bender," Of course, it would all require split-second robotic timing. That's were I come in. You see, I own a watch. 
",11020215,Farnsworth," There. This time I'm sure I've fixed the mind-switcher.
",5720216,Amy," Good, I'm sick of cleaning up those heaps of dead monkeys. But why would you want your mind in a new body?
",10820217,Farnsworth," Well, as a man enters his 18th decade, he thinks back on the mistakes he's made in life.
",9020218,Amy," Like the heaps of dead monkeys?
",3320219,Farnsworth," Science cannot move forward without heaps! No, what I regret is the youth I wasted playing it safe.
",10120220,Amy," I wasted my youth porking out.
",3220221,Farnsworth," Yes, I remember. 
",1920222,Amy," Would you please take that down? It's making me hungry.
",5720223,Farnsworth," Funny, I could use a little extra meat on my bones.  Wait a second, if we switch bodies, I could live life to the extreme, and you could indulge your demonic food lust.
",17020224,Amy,"  We are just the people this mind-switcher was made for by us!  Wait, can I still change my mind?
",9920225,Farnsworth," Let's find out. 
",1820226,Amy,"  It didn't work you doddering old 
",3620227,Farnsworth,"  Ah! Cartilage! Dude, I bid you a fond cowabunga! I'm off to laugh at the Reaper.  Look out, world, here I...  I'm sorry, Amy, but your body is not up to the task. Also, I don't care for these boobs flapping every which way. Now quit your bologna-gargling and let's switch back to our original bodies.
",30320228,Bender," Body switcher, eh? Mayhap the heist is back on. Who needs accomplices, if I can just use their bodies.
",10420229,Amy,"  Professor, what's not happening?
",3520230,Farnsworth,"  Bad news, me.  I failed to take into account the cerebral immune response.
",7720231,Amy,"  You idiot!
",1320232,Farnsworth,"  Once two bodies have switched minds, they can never switch back.  However, perhaps they can. Maybe we can swap back using a third body for temporary storage space.
",16620233,Bender," I'm 60% storage space. 
",2520234,Farnsworth,"  Eh, wha? 
",1220235,Bender,"  Well, I'm off to the royal yacht for a quick seduce-and-snatch. 
",6720236,Amy,"  See ya!
",1020237,Farnsworth," Now then, Amy, we'll simply switch bodies, and then we'll... we'll... No, I'd be back in my body, but then you and Bender would be switched. And the Amy and Bender bodies can't trade minds again, since they just did.
",21820238,Amy,"  Oh no! Is it possible to get everyone back to normal using four or more bodies?
",8220239,Farnsworth," I'm not sure. I'm afraid we need to use... MATH. 
",5120240,Bender,"  Stupid, air-needing lungs.  The crown jewels. Now I just have to locate the guard and seduce him in...  Four seconds?
",12020241,Basil," Who goes there?
",1720242,Bender,"   Three, two, one. Hello, big boy. 
",3720243,Basil," Silence! I am Basil, the emperor's cousin and chief of his royal guard. And I shall not be seduced by a... 
",10920244,Bender,"  I said, ""Wow chica wow wow"".
",3120245,Leela," Professor, what's the matter.
",3120246,Amy,"  I'm Amy. The Professor and I switched bodies.
",4820247,Leela," Oh, lord.
",1120248,Amy,"  All I wanted was to gorge myself a little, but I can't digest anything with these false teeth and this hit-or-miss colon.
",12420249,Leela," At least, you get the senior discount at the movies. I hate paying $14 to see Nicolas Cage solve things.
",10620250,Amy,"  If you want to save $2, we could switch bodies.
",5020251,Leela," We could always switch back, right? 
",3820252,Fry," Hey, Leela. Mmm. What smells saturated?
",4120253,Amy,"  Deep-fried ice cream sandwich wrapped in frosting and lightly baconed.
",7320254,Fry," Woah. That sounds like something Amy would say and eat.
",5720255,Amy,"  I am Amy. Leela and I used the Professor's mind-switching machine. [She puts ketchup on her ""creation"".
",10620256,Fry," So Leela's in your body?
",2620257,Leela,"  Not exactly.  Aha! You do only like me for my body.
",5420258,Fry," That is entirely not true, sir!
",3320259,Bender,"  Now to go switch bodies with Zoidberg, sneak past the metal detector and clip the alarm wires, all in less than...  Ten minutes ago! Oh!  Uh, could you come back when my chump gets here?
",18920260,Nikolai," Now then, what is a filthy human doing aboard my royal yacht?
",6320261,Bender,"  With all due respect, Your Majesty, I'm a robot like you. I just switch bodies with some bimbo. Go ahead, ask me something only a robot would know.
",15020262,Nikolai," Ah, a reverse Turing test, eh? Very good. What is the square root of nine?
",7620263,Bender,"  Hold on, let me just get out a pencil.  Okay, look, I'm not that kind of robot. I'm more this kind. [He starts beat boxing and Moonwalking.
",14220264,Basil," He steps forwards but moves backwards.
",4020265,Nikolai," By the gods! he is a machine!
",3120266,Farnsworth,"  No, that won't restore everyone, either. Besides, I don't want my decrepit old body back! I'm running away with this invincible robot body and joining something!
",16420267,Fishy Joe," I paid for 15 Robot Clowns per cubic meter of car, and you're barely giving me 12. Now crumple up and get in... And fasten your seat belts.
",14120268,Robot #1 Clown," Oh, come on!
",1420269,Farnsworth,"  Good day. I am Nonchalanto, the robot daredevil. And my dream is to risk my life in strange and original ways.
",11320270,Fishy Joe," Hmm. You don't look so foolhardy to me.
",4120271,Fishy Joe," That's the dumbest thing anybody's ever done. Your hired! 
",6020272,Nikolai," So youâ€™re a common bending robot with a human peasant roommate?
",6520273,Bender,"  Oh, crap, that is what I am!
",3120274,Nikolai," No, Bender, I envy you. I'm so bored with all of these pretentious trappings. The jewels, the parties, the beautiful robo women.
",13020275,Princess Flavia," Hello.
",820276,Nikolai," My fiancÃ©e, Princess Flavia. Dearest, meet Bender. He's a robot in the body of a Chinese Martian physicist.
",10920277,Flavia," How tedious. 
",1520278,Nikolai," Oh, to escape this gilded cage for a day.
",4320279,Bender,"  You know, we could trade bodies. I could take over the humdrum royal stuff and you could be an regular Joe for a day.  Or more. Much more.
",14120280,Nikolai," In that horrible non-robot body. Sir, I have my standards.
",6020281,Bender,"  Ah, but what if I could put you in my fabulous bending-robot body?
",6920282,Nikolai,"  Me, posing as a lowly bending unit? How wicked! But wait, I'm supposed to give a speech at the UN tomorrow. Can I trust you to do it?
",13620283,Bender,"  You can trust anything.
",2620284,Hermes," You aren't, are you?
",2220285,Fry," Of course not! But I was willing to lie about it. What more can a man do?
",7520286,Hermes," A man can give her a toke of her own medicine.
",4820287,Fry," Yes! I can put my mind in a hideous body and show Leela she's not attracted to me. But it would have to be a really, really disgusting body.
",14220288,Zoidberg," Friends! Friends! I've got barnacles on my tuchus! 
",5320289,Hermes," The long search is over.
",2620290,Bender,"  Wait here and earn interest while I find my robot body.
",5820291,Bender,"  Professor?
",1320292,Leela,"  Leela. Amy?
",1420293,Bender,"  Bender. Have you seen my body? I think the Professor's in it.
",6420294,Leela,"  Yeah, he said something about running away. Then he ran away.
",6420295,Bender,"  What? Wither?
",1620296,Bender,"  What am I gonna do? I got an emperor all patsied up to switch bodies, but only with another robot!
",10120297,Wash bucket," Wash bucket full.
",1920298,Scruffy," Scruffy's work here is done. 
",3120299,Bender,"  
",320300,Bender,"  Now to find Emperor Von Richendoof.
",3820301,Wash bucket,"  Now to find Scruffy. 
",2420302,Zoidberg," Switch bodies? I don't see why not. I also don't see why. 
",6020303,Fry,"  In your face, Leela. 
",2420304,Nikolai," If you're a bender, why is your body full of fetid water?
",5920305,Bender,"  If you're an emperor, why don't you shut up? Move it, Fry. 
",6220306,Bender,"  Well, so long.
",1720307,Nikolai,"  Wait! Point me to my normal human roommate!
",4620308,Bender,"  That's him there, maybe.  Got to go!
",3920309,Zoidberg,"  Robot?
",920310,Nikolai,"  Yes, 'tis I, Bender. Do you not recognize your own best friend?
",6620311,Zoidberg,"  Aha! The guy in this body has a friend! Bender, old pal! It's me, the Fry! 
",7820312,Leela,"  But then Nicolas Cage discovered that the real treasure was his family. Yes, I'll hold.
",9020313,Fry,"  Hey, Leela, look! I'm in Zoidberg.
",3720314,Leela,"   Fry?
",820315,Fry,"  Oh, you're not so shallow that you find me repulsive because of my body, are you? 
",8520316,Leela,"   Not at all.  Amy, stop it! Fry, help! She's turning me into a parade float!
",7920317,Fry,"  Eww! look at her! 
",2120318,Leela,"  Oh. So you're so shallow that my body disgusts you if it puts on a little extra weight?
",9020319,Fry,"  That wasn't a little extra weight.
",3720320,Leela,"  Admit it! You don't care about the inner me at all!
",5420321,Fry,"  No, you admit it! You'd be ashamed to be seen in public with someone as hideous as me!
",8920322,Leela,"  Would not!
",1320323,Fry,"  Oh, yeah? Then I challenge you to a romantic dinner at Elzar's tonight.
",7420324,Leela,"  It's on.
",1120325,Hermes," Sweet orca of Majorca! You make Fat Albert look like Normal Albert!
",6920326,Amy,"  I don't know what to do. Do you think I should eat more butter?
",6620327,Hermes," I am putting a stop to this, right now! Come on! We're switching bodies.
",7420328,Amy,"  Hermes, no! I'll ruin your body, too!
",4020329,Hermes," Three decades of the munchies beat you to it.
",4720330,Big Bertha," You make quite a show, young man.  You remind me of myself as a young cannon.
",7920331,Chainsaw-Eating Robot #1," Big Bertha is the circus's grande dame. She shoots robots through the air.
",7620332,Bertha,"  Excuse me. Too much goulash.
",3120333,Farnsworth,"  I've always wanted to be shot out of something. How about a quick blast after lunch.
",8720334,Bertha," Alas, a fine big one like you would shatter my barrel. But, ah, to amaze the crowd once more.
",9520335,Farnsworth,"  I understand the problem of age, but suppose I could put you into a new body?
",8020336,Bertha," Never! My body may be old, but it is mine, and every crack a memory of heavy things shot a long way. Good day.
",11220337,Bender,"  Ah! I have everything I every wanted. Money, wealth, riches. Yet something's missing. A hot princess with which to get grizzly.
",13020338,Flavia,"  Hello.
",920339,Bender,"  Hello, baby!  Huh? Hey, what's going on here? And why are you kissing my dashing cousin instead of me?
",10520340,Flavia," Nikolai, you imperial fool! We've been having an affair for 700 years.
",7220341,Basil," At long last, I shall kill you, blame the burglar and inherit the throne. 
",7620342,Flavia," Farewell, Nikolai.
",2020343,Bender,"  Wait! I'm not Nikolai! I'm Bender, the fabulous body-switching burglar. 
",7520344,Basil," So you are. However, you do have Nikolai's body, and that's the part we want to kill. 
",8820345,Fry,"  Great food, huh? 
",2020346,Leela,"  Ew!
",620347,Fry,"  I'm sorry, Leela. I hope that didn't make you ashamed to be seen with me.
",7620348,Leela,"  No, it only makes you more attractive. 
",4220349,Fry,"  Ew!
",620350,Leela,"  Oh, did my bodily infirmity embarrass you?
",4520351,Fry,"  Not at all. It's just another thing that makes you a very special lady.
",7420352,Leela,"  You mean, like my penis?  Eh!
",3220353,Fry,"  Admit it! You're disgusted by me!
",3620354,Leela,"  No, you're disgusted by me!
",3020355,Fry,"  I'm as attracted to you as I've ever been!
",4520356,Leela,"  Prove it! 
",1320357,Zoidberg,"  Well, Bender, here's our apartment that we live in everyday.  A floor? We live like kings?
",9320358,Nikolai,"  Kings? Silence! Like you, I'm a common lout. Now fetch me some working-class cognac from our brandy storeroom that you know how to find.
",13920359,Zoidberg,"   Relax, Bender. I'll dry up that leak with this heating box. 
",6420360,Nikolai,"    Ah, cigars. Light me up, old friend. 
",4220361,Robot #1," There you are, Emperor Nikolai. It's time for your speech to the UN.
",7020362,Bender,"  The what now? 
",1720363,Scruffy," Miss Wong?
",1220364,Wash bucket,"  No, Scruffy, I am wash bucket. I love you. Wash bucket has always loved you. 
",8020365,Scruffy," It's wrong, wash bucket. Oh, it would be sweet for a while, but in the back of our minds, we'd know that I'm a man and you're janitorial equipment.
",14920366,Wash bucket,"   In another city, we could be anyone we want!
",4820367,Scruffy," Go. Go now, before I beg you to stay.
",3920368,Scruffy," Yep.
",620369,Nixon," Please welcome an insane dictator, and one heck of a bowler, Emperor Nikolai!
",7920370,Bender,"   Thanks, Nixon. How we doing?
",3220371,Woman #1," I love you, Your Majesty.
",2720372,Bender,"  Shut up, madam ambassador, I know it. Anyhow,  I'd now like to digress from my prepared remarks to say, ""I'm done"". 
",11920373,Basil,"  Ladies and gentlemen, this robot is an impostor!  I shall enjoy this.
",7220374,Bender,"  Not me.
",1020375,Chainsaw-Eating Robot #1," That devil, Basil, will kill our emperor.
",4320376,Farnsworth,"  You're Robo-Hungarian?
",2520377,Robot #1 Carny," Yes. Our nation's chief export is carnies.
",4420378,Farnsworth,"  If only there was some way I could get to the UN to help.
",6020379,Bertha," There is. Get in, Nonchalanto.
",3220380,Chainsaw-Eating Robot #1," Bertha, no! It would kill you!
",3220381,Bertha," I have not so much time left anyhow.
",3820382,Farnsworth,"  But you could get a new body! You could have a rich, full life!
",6620383,Bertha," I am trying to have a rich, full life.  Long live Robo-Hungary! 
",6620384,Bender,"  Me! Thank God you've come!
",2920385,Farnsworth,"   This is for Big Bertha.  That is not what I meant to give you for Big Bertha.
",8120386,Leela,"  That was nice.
",1720387,Fry,"  Oh, yeah. 
",1320388,Nixon," Ow. Ow. Arrooo! 
",1820389,Basil," Whoever you are, you're the bravest robot I've ever seen.  I like killing brave things.
",8920390,Farnsworth,"  Good, because I've got 20 of them per cubic meter. 
",5420391,Boy," When I grow up, I wanna be a diplomat!
",4020392,Bender,"  Well, if they're is one thing I learned, it's a lesson. I believe this belongs to you. 
",9020393,Nikolai,"  I shall sell it to help the common folk, now that I understand their misery.
",7920394,Bender,"  Yeah, good luck with that.
",2920395,Leela,"  I must say, Hermes, you've got a smoking-hot body.
",5320396,Hermes,"  I was inspired by Amy. 
",2620397,Leela,"  Wow! How did you do it.
",2620398,Amy,"  Well, there I was at Elzar's, eating a nice pork sundae and suddenly, I just lost my appetite.  Forever.
",10720399,Sweet Clyde,"  Q to the E to the D!
",2320400,Farnsworth,"  So it is possible us all to get back to our original bodies?
",6320401,Bubblegum," Stone-cold munching, Prof. Sweet Clyde, characterize your inversion theorem.
",7820402,Sweet Clyde," Basically, no matter how permuted-up your minds are, they can be restored using, at most, two extra players. 
",11120403,Farnsworth,"  And they say pure math has no real-world applications!
",5720404,Sweet Clyde," Everybody back in their zones? 
",3320405,Farnsworth," Ah! My body may be old, but it is mine. Brilliant work, Clyde. You'll win the NBAâ€™s highest academic honor for this.
",11820406,Nikolai," Also, I'm making you a duke.  So long filthy commoners.
",5720407,Bender," Â¡AdiÃ_s! And I'm left with the real jewels safely inside...  ...his compartment!
",8120408,Bender,"  All right. I'll need accomplices.

",2020426,Fry," So? What do you think of my comic?
",3620427,Bender," Let me put it like this. After I leave here, I'm getting a memory enema.
",7420428,Leela," If I may offer some constructive criticism, there was never any real peril. I mean, the delivery guy has, like, 30 superpowers.
",12920429,Fry," Well, that's because he was bitten by a radioactive superman!

",1720440,Farnsworth," That's how I know it's bunkum. The Farnsworth Novelty Disintegrator Ray is nothing more than a common teleporter ray.  Worthless toy.
",13520441,Fry," I'm sick of being critiqued by nitpicking nerds. I'm taking this to a comic book convention!
",9420442,Amy," Smeesh, it's crowded!
",2320443,Bender," Good thing everyone is freshly bathed and groomed.
",5220444,Nerd #1," What are you doing?  That's the rare Zapp Brannigan with recording session blooper! 
",8620445,Action Figure," Don't tell me how to do the line. It sickens me.
",5020446,Zoidberg," But the sign said there was a mint in the box.
",4820447,Groening," Thank you so... Okay, thanks... Thanks so... Settle down!
",5920448,Groening," So, anyway, we're really excited to show you guys the pilot for our new TV series.
",8420449,Cohen," It's set it the year 4000, and we call it Futurella!
",5420450,Groening," Wow. Fox has really streamlined the process.
",4620451,Bill Morrison Robot #1," Matt will now take questions. But please, only about Futurella, not the Simpsons. Yes? The robot standing on the small child over there?
",13820452,Bender," Yeah, when are you going to make a second Simpsons Movie?  D'oh!
",6620453,Fry," Mr. AragonÃ©s, I'm a big fan of your cartoons and your mustache.
",6520454,AragonÃ©s," You want it? Take it. It's brought me nothing but misery.
",5920455,Fry," Wow. Thanks!  If you could just quiet down, I wanted to get your opinion of my comic book.
",9220456,AragonÃ©s," SeÃ±or, anyone who still writes comics is a hero to me.  Mmm. It stinks. But, um, I do like the tiny doodles in the margins.
",12520457,Fry," Oh, that's just some relish from a hot dog I found.
",5320458,Man #1," Attention, ladies and gentleboys, the costume contest is about to begin.
",7420459,Bender,"  The costume contest! The costume contest! 
",4520460,Leela," What the hell are you supposed to be?
",3920461,Bender,"  Every nerd's fantasy, baby.
",3020462,Randy,"  Next up, contestant number 36!  Contestant 36, everyone. Next up, contestant 37...
",8520463,Lrrr,"  I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet...
",3620464,Randy," Hold on a second, let me just get this. 
",4220465,Lrrr," I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8. You are hereby conquered! Please line up in order of how much beryllium it takes to kill you. 
",14520466,Grrrl,"  Damn, that's a good costume.
",3120467,Randy,"  Next up contestant 38!
",2520468,Lrrr," I don't understand. Why are the human still eating their soft pretzels instead of surrendering?
",9720469,Leela,"  They're probably waiting for Joss Whedon.
",4420470,Lrrr,": Joss Whedon's here? Wait a minute, you look familiar.
",5620471,Leela," Yeah, you almost ate me once. I was in your mouth for five minutes.
",6920472,Lrrr," Leela?
",820473,Randy," And the winner is, Nerdgasma! 
",3220474,Bender," Wooh, I've got fruit boobs!
",2920475,Lrrr," What's the use?
",1720476,Lrrr," Now what?
",1120477,Ndnd," I send you out to conquer a planet and all you bring back is J.J. Abrams' face? 
",8220478,Lrrr," I thought you'd like it. You haven't even tried it on.
",5620479,Ndnd," I might dress up in a face if you ever took me anywhere nice!
",6320480,Lrrr," Oh, boy, here we go. I built this castle with my own two slaves. What are you gonna to do, kick me out?
",10520481,Lrrr," I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8. May I crash on your couch?
",7720482,Farnsworth," So he just showed up unannounced, raided the liquor cabinet, sprayed urine on the ceiling and passed out?
",10720483,Amy," And the walls.
",1620484,Lrrr," Leave me alone. My wife hates me and planetary conquest has become a chore.
",7720485,Farnsworth," There, there. You're just having a mid-life crisis.
",5320486,Lrrr," Mid-life crisis, eh?  Lrrr demands the comfort of pop-psychological platitudes.
",8120487,Bender," Look, hoss, your wife threw you out. That's your license to be a jerk. Do whatever the hell you want then walk away and light a cigar. [He pulls a cigar out of his chest cabinet, lights it, and walks away.
",20720488,Leela," Don't listen to him, Lrrr. Bender may seem happy.  But in the long-tern, you need to reinvest in your relationship with Ndnd.
",12720489,Lrrr," Yes, it's clear what I must do.
",3320490,Lrrr," I like it.
",1220491,Surgeon," I'm thinking we downplay those hideous growths on your head. 
",6320492,Lrrr," Horns are a sign of virility. Also, they house my testes.
",5920493,Surgeon," I'm thinking horn extension.
",3020494,Bender," You'll need some arm candy. It's the perfect accessory for out-of-shape, middle-aged creeps like you. Yeah, I said it! What's your time, Borgnine?
",14820495,Lrrr," Big and angry. 
",1720496,Bender," Look, brah, you just not gonna find a whole lot of hot, gigantic Omicronian babes in this solar system.
",10520497,Lrrr," There's one! 
",1520498,Grrrl," Hey, cool cape. Were'd you get it?
",3620499,Lrrr," What, this old thing? I murdered my father. My name's Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
",9920500,Grrrl," I am called Grrrl.
",2020501,Lrrr," Of the planet Omicron Persei 8? That is a pretty name.
",5620502,Lrrr," What's on the TV tonight? Oh, wait! I don't care, because I've got a date!
",7620503,Leela," I know it's not what you want to hear, but I think this is a mistake.
",7120504,Fry," Leela's right. That's not what you want to hear. What you want to hear is that I fixed my comic book. Now the hero is more reliable because he has no more ridiculous powers.
",17520505,Lrrr," Let's watch, shall we.
",2420506,Invader X," One more step and little Miss Constructive Criticism here gets it!
",6820507,Delivery-Boy Man #1," Oh, yeah? I may be just a simple delivery boy with no superpowers, so there's nothing I can do.
",9720508,Invader X," Okay. 
",820509,Fry," So? Give me your honest praise.
",3320510,Leela," Fry, I've now seen two comic books, so listen to me. Why should I care about the hero when all he does is cry?
",11220511,Lrrr," Hmm. That dinner was a worthy foe.
",3620512,Grrrl," Yes, we shall not see its like again. So, um... 
",5020513,Lrrr," Um, I'm sorry. I haven't done this for a while. I just got partway out of a bad relationship.
",9520514,Grrrl," Maybe I should take this off. 
",3220515,Lrrr,"  You're a human?
",1820516,Grrrl," Only physically. I'm a cross-species dresser.  Wait, you're an actual Omicronian?
",8320517,Lrrr," Oh, God. Oh God, what have I done?
",3620518,Grrrl," This is so hot! Conquer me, Lrrr! Sharpen your horns on my scaly thorax! 
",7520519,Lrrr,"  I want to go home! But Ndnd would never take me back now.
",6020520,Leela," Ndnd just wants what every she-beast wants, to feel like you're listening to her nagging. Is there anything she has been riding your ass about?
",14520521,Lrrr," Conquering things, I guess. I could conquer Earth, kill all humans.
",6920522,Bender," There's a thought.
",2020523,Leela," No! We don't need a war of the worlds.
",4020524,Fry," That's it! We need a War of the Worlds! I'll call Orson Welles 
",6520525,Bender," Dork calling Orson! Dork calling Orson!
",4120526,Welles," You're asking me, the renowned spokesperson for Paul Masson wine, to recreate my brilliant  1938 radio broadcast merely to deceive and impress the wife of this skinny reptile?
",17720527,Fry," Sorry. Never mind.
",2020528,Welles," I do it for free.
",1920529,Welles," Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt our program of the Jonas Brothers and their orchestra to bring you a special bulletin. 
Welles: We interrupt our program of the Jonas Brothers and their orchestra to bring you a special bulletin.
",23220530,Welles,"  I'm speaking to you from the hickory farms in Grover's Mall, New Jersey,   through a mouthful of summer sausage, mmm, where I hardly know where to being. Mmm!  A huge spacecraft, piloted by a devastatingly handsome... Now, how, in God's name, do I know what the fellow looks like if he's inside a ship miles in the air?  It's just foolish on its face.
",35420531,Fry," If you want the cheese log, you'll read what I wrote.
",5520532,Welles," Very well. I shall comply.
",2820533,Welles," I'm getting reports that cities across the globe are being destroyed by this noble invader, whose good looks are apparently discernible across vast distances and through solid metal.  But wait, the leader of the attack is swaggering out of his ship and up to a convenient nearby microphone. Now why couldn't I have just described his appearance at this point? This is the type of thing I'm talking about.
Lrrr: People of Earth, I am Lrrr, conqueror of your planet.  Cue screams.  You will now remove your skulls and play dodgeball with them for my amusement.
",56020534,Ndnd," Ooh! I could swear his horns have gotten longer!
",5020535,Kif," Sir, I've intercepted an Earth broadcast.
",4320536,Zapp," Put it up on the Zenith.  Oh, God!
Welles:  Earth is conquered, the destruction of civilization complete. Now stay tuned for Little Orphan Annie.
",14720537,Zapp," To hell with Little Orphan Annie! We've got to do something.
",6220538,Lrrr," What's that, honey? How many dead? Uh, I don't know, 80 million? Okay. I love you, too.  That was Ndnd, she's taking me back! 
",12820539,Welles," I'm sorry I've been so difficult.
",3520540,Zapp," So, you thought you could conquer us so easily, eh? Nice job. We surrender. Earth is yours. 
",9420541,Welles," Damn, I'm good. Now, may I please have that cheese log?
",5720542,Zapp," Oh, glorious conqueror, permit me to offer up a sacrifice.  How 'bout this?
",7720543,Kif,"  Hey!
",720544,Lrrr," Yeah, he'll do.
Leela: Come on, Lrrr. Show's over.
",5220545,Lrrr," Fine, okay. About this conquering thing.  Funny story.
",5620546,Ndnd," Hello, Lrrr.
",1420547,Leela," Lrrr! Put a stop to this right now!
",3720548,Lrrr," Okay, okay. Quit nagging!
",2720549,Ndnd," Lrrr, why are you yelling softly with the purple-furred one?
",6220550,Lrrr," Uh, it's nothing, my queen. 
",3020551,Leela," He messed up my hair.
",2320552,Kif," I'm missing a leg.
",2020553,Zapp," We fought like Hell, sir, but in the end, we caved like a house of soufflÃ© cards.
",8320554,Nixon," Got it. Peace with honor. Well, I resign again.
",4920555,Ndnd," Come, Nixon. Introduce me to the kitchen staff. I must lay down the law about Lrrr's low sodium diet. 
",10420556,Leela," You've got to tell her the truth. And lay off the salted peanuts!
",6720557,Lrrr," I'm just trying to get the leg taste out of my mouth.
",5520558,Ndnd," Lrrr, I'm in here now, not out there!
",3920559,Lrrr," Give me a little time. With a lady like Ndnd, one must use finesse.  Coming, giangantums!
",9120560,Ndnd,"  Mmm. That's crisp.
",2120561,Lrrr," Yes, but no more so than your squamous dorsal plates in the moonlight.
",7220562,Ndnd,"  I am experiencing arousal. My organs are moving into position. 
",6620563,Lrrr," Ndnd, there's something that I've got to tell you.
",5220564,Ndnd," What is it? Is there someone else?
Lrrr: What? No, no, it's about this takeover of Earth. It's... It's...
",10720565,Ndnd," The spark that reignited our marriage?
",4020566,Lrrr," Yes! Exactly. Good night. 
",2820567,Leela," Oh, lord! Now what?
",2120568,Lrrr," I couldn't tell her the truth!
Leela: Look, you scaly crybaby, you'll do what I say and do it now!
",10020569,Ndnd," I knew it!
",1220570,Bender,"  Frying pans! Cast-iron frying pans!
",3820571,Lrrr," It's not what it looks like! What do I do?
",4420572,Leela," Do what I say. Tell her!
",2620573,Ndnd," Tell me what?  Give me the heavy one. 
",4020574,Lrrr," The invasion was all a fake. I just wanted to impress you.
",6020575,Ndnd," You lied? What else have you been hiding from me?
",5120576,Lrrr," What else? Nothing else.
",2620577,Grrrl," I still want you, Lrrr, and I'm willing to fight for you.
",5920578,Bender," All I've got left is a colander and a pie pan.
",4820579,Ndnd," Lrrr?
",720580,Lrrr," Look, we only had one date. I barely mated with her.
",5420581,Ndnd," Whatever. I harbor no resentment against her.  What I want to know is what is up between you and Bossy Boots here.
",11620582,Lrrr," Her? She's just a bossy friend.
",3320583,Ndnd," Exactly! She nagged you, tormented you, and pushed you around. That is my job! This must be settled. I demand the ancient ritual of Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or Consequences!
",17020584,Fry," Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or what?
",3020585,Ndnd," Let the ritual begin. The rules are the same as in the home version. Lrrr must simply choose between myself and Leela...
",12220586,Leela," Fine. Hurry up.
",1720587,Ndnd," By shooting the one he rejects.
",3320588,Leela," Lrrr, I'm getting angry. Don't you go through with this.
",5820589,Ndnd," She is not the boss of you! I am the boss of you! 
",5220590,Fry," Leela's gonna die. What would Delivery-Boy Man do? 
Lrrr:  I do not want to shoot anybody.
",9220591,Ndnd," You never want to do anything!
",3220592,Lrrr," Oh, nag, nag, nag.
",2020593,Ndnd," You want me to stop nagging? Then shoot me!
",4520594,Lrrr," Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
",3620595,Ndnd," Beats staring at your fat ass on the couch.
",4520596,Ndnd," Oh, yeah! Well I'll show you. 
",3220597,Fry,"  Ray-blocking power! 
",2320598,Leela," Fry! 
",720599,Ndnd," Lrrr, you were willing to shoot that bossy temptress! You really do value my nagging above all others!
",10420600,Leela," Good night, dumb prince.
",2620601,Grrrl,"  Come back, Lrrr! I wanna have your Popplers! They'll never be anyone but you!  Hello.
",8820602,Zoidberg," Of course I'll marry you!
",2720603,Amy," Wait, what the Shmell happened? I thought Ndnd disintegrated you with this ray gun.
",8520604,Grrrl," It's just a cheap teleporter. I bought it off the back of a comic book.
",7320605,Farnsworth," Cha-ching!
",1220606,Leela," The teleporter gun? But that means Fry might still be...
Amy: Fry?
",6820607,Zoidberg," Fry?
",620608,Bender,"  Is this him?
",1520609,Leela," Fry, you're alive!
",2020610,Fry," Not only that, I now know exactly how to end my comic book. Let's watch.
",7420611,Invader X," Say good-bye to your forehead, 'cause I'm gonna shoot you in it!
",6620612,Delivery-Boy Man #1," Not if I leap in front of your death ray, and I am gonna do that. Jumping sound! Ow! 
",8720613,Invader X," I didn't shoot yet. As usual, your delivery arrived too soon. 
",6420614,Lane," Oh, Delivery-Boy Man! You saved me by random chance.
",5420615,Delivery-Boy Man #1," Don't thank random chance. Thank my meteor-wishing power, with your lips. 
",7620616,Leela,"  Good ending. Not great.
",2620617,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. We've been hired to make our 100th delivery.
",6720618,Zoidberg," 100!
",620619,Hermes," That's almost 10 per year.
",2820620,Bender," This calls for a party, baby. I'm ordering a hundred kegs, a hundred hookers, and a hundred Elvis impersonators who aren't above a little hooking, should the occasion arise!
",17520621,Elzar,"  Be very gentle, folks. This is the soufflÃ© you'll be delivering to Mrs. Astor.
",8120622,Bender," Oh my God, it's Elzar! Hi, Elzar! Great soufflÃ©, Elzar!
",5720623,Elzar," Whatever you do, don't drop it.  See, Mrs. Astor takes nitroglycerine for her heart, and being a class act, she prefers it in soufflÃ© form.   Bam.
",14820624,Farnsworth," To prevent the soufflÃ© from exploding, Bender will carry it. He's gyroscopically stable.
",9020625,Farnsworth," Look, Mrs. Astor's mansion, just across that rickety rope bridge. 
",6820626,Amy," Wow, it's ricketier than it looks. You'd better try to jump it, Bender.
",7320627,Bender," Okay, let me back up for a running start. 
",4420628,Hobsy,"  I shall inform Mrs. Astor that the circus is in town.
",5620629,Hobsy," Your soufflÃ©, Madam.
",2220630,Mrs. Astor," I shall take it here, under my fork.
",3820631,Zoidberg," Where's the exploding?
",2420632,Hobsy," One does not explode in Mrs. Astor's face.
",4420633,Mrs. Astor," I couldn't eat another bite. Hobsy?
",3720634,Mrs. Astor," Well done, sir. Have you a name?
",3420635,Farnsworth," Hubert Farnsworth, at your service.
",3720636,Mrs. Astor," A Farnsworth, you say? Well, if I'm not mistaken, the Farnsworths have been in New New York for almost two hundred years.
",12320637,Farnsworth," Yes, I have.
",1420638,Fry," And I'm his uncle!
",2020639,Mrs. Astor," How charmingly unconventional.
",3220640,Fry," I can eat a hotdog underwater.
",3220641,Mrs. Astor," Say, would you Farnsworths care to be my guests tomorrow at the Astor Endowment Fundraiser? All the best families will be there.
",13020642,Fry," We can take 'em.
",1820643,Mrs. Astor,"  On April 10, 2912, my late husband and I set off down Fifth Avenue aboard the Land Titanic, the largest street-going vessel ever built.  Just four days into her maiden voyage, as we approached 32 Street, the line-liner struck a mailbox and went down.   2000 souls were lost that day, including my dear husband. In loving memory, I established the Mr. Astor Endowment, which this year supports the United Mutant Scholarship Fund.
",43120644,Fry,"  Mutants? That's the kind of thing you are.
",4520645,Leela," Shh. You know mutants aren't allowed on the surface. If anyone asks, say I'm an alien, remember?
",9820646,Fry," Right. You gonna finish that roll?
",3620647,Leela," Shh.
",620648,Mrs. Astor," Now a short film about those pitiable creatures so in need of our charity.
",7620649,Narrator," Far beneath the everyday rumble of limousines and poodle feet, there toil a downtrodden people even less well off than the upper middle class.  The noble sewer mutants. For you see, generations of exposure to toxic sewage mutated them into horrific monsters! 
",26120650,Leela," Shut up!
",1020651,Narrator," These industrious, uh, people, I guess, maintain the various pipes and poop chutes that keep decent, above-ground society functioning.  And where do these proud toileteers learn their menial skills? At Brown University, the nation's premier institution of lower learning. So please, give generously, knowing some poor helpless mutant will thank you. Not in person, thank God!
",37720652,Leela," Well, that was disturbing.
",2820653,Mrs. Astor," Oh, I understand, dear. They are hideous.
",4320654,Leela," Look, I guess you mean well, but isn't that university just a tax-deductible sewer-cleaning service?
",10220655,Mrs. Astor," My dear, that school is about much more than sewer pipes.
",5920656,Leela," Really?
",920657,Mrs. Astor," It's also about keeping those filthy things busy. There are thousands of them down there, breeding like rats.
",11120658,Royalty girl,"  My great uncle once saw a rat.
",3320659,Mrs. Astor," If we don't keep them busy, they'll start jabbering on about equal rights in their ill-bred manner.
",10120660,Leela," Let's go. If I say one more thing, I might say it with my evening boot.
",7320661,Mrs. Astor," Well! Rarely have I never!
",2820662,Fry," Please, don't blame Leela. She's just a little ill-bred. You know how mutants are.
",8420663,Mrs. Astor," You companion is a mutant?
",2820664,Fry," But if anyone asks, say she's an alien.
",4120665,Mrs. Astor," Help! Police!
",1520666,URL," You may have eluded the authorities, but don't nothing get past Mrs. Astor. 
",7820667,Leela,"  What's gonna happen to me?
",2920668,Smitty," Permanent deportation, you mutant.
",3620669,URL," You going downtown, baby. Way down. 
",3820670,Raoul," Incoming!
",1120671,Leela," Thanks, Colonel.
",1820672,Colonel," Just doing my job, ma'am. 
",2820673,Leela," Oh, Mom, Dad, I can't believe I have to spend the rest of my life in this hellhole.  I'm sorry.
",9720674,Turanga Munda," It's okay, sweetie. Now that you're here, this hellhole feels more like a nice, regular hole.
",9520675,Turanga Morris," What do ya say we go get some sewer coffee, sewer cake, and Safeway ice cream?
",8020676,Bender,"  Well, the bottom's all stocked with cheap stuff. Who's in the mood to party?  Whoo!
",8620677,Fry," Poor, Leela. I feel like I ruined her life.
",4520678,Hermes," You did ruin her life.
",2420679,Fry," You might be right, Hermes.
",2920680,Hermes," I am right.
",1320681,Fry," I almost feel like we should do something to help her.
",5620682,Hermes," We should do something!
",2520683,Fry," I don't care what you say, Hermes. Let's go.
",4620684,Fry," Oh, mighty mayor. We're here about Turanga Leela.
",5120685,Poopenmeyer," You mean Leela?
",1720686,Fry," Right. I mean sure, she's a mutant, we've known that for years. But we kept it a secret because she's a fine, upstanding...
",12520687,Poopenmeyer," Wait. You knowingly attempted to harbor a mutant?
",5120688,Hermes," We did harbor a mutant! Uh-oh.
",3220689,Munda," Look, Leela, there's Old Filthful. 
",3720690,Leela," Urgh!
",720691,Morris," And there's the West Side Pipeway.  If those guys slack off for even a second, it could explode.  Hey, guys! This is my daughter, Leela.
",13820692,Morris," Well, they're with the chuds, now.
",3620693,Leela," These conditions are deplorable. I swear, I hate every single person on the surface for making us live like this.
",11520694,Fry," Leela!
",820695,Leela," What are you doing here?
",2620696,Amy," We were sentence to two weeks in the sewer for harboring a mutant.
",6820697,Zoidberg," Three dollars at the drug store.
",3420698,Fry," I'm so sorry I ratted you out, but, you know, after two weeks down here, I'll truly understand the plight of the mutant people.
",12920699,Leela," How dare you? You wanna understand something? Look at that lake. One dip in that toxic muck and your DNA will be permanently mutated. You'll grow a camel hump or a Zoidberg face.
",18020700,Zoidberg," Urgh!
",720701,Leela," You wanna know what it's like to be a mutant? Jump in and go for a swim.
",7420702,Fry," I would, but I ate a bunch of potato salad, so...
",5120703,Leela," Yeah, that's what I thought. You are all surface.
",5120704,Bender," Fry! Hermes! Where my humans are? Ah, who cares? It is on.
",6020705,H.G. Blob," Hey, hey, hey.
",1620706,Hedonism Bot," I trust the orgy pit has been scraped and buttered?
",5320707,Bender," You know it, and there's mini-quiches, too.
",4520708,Hermes," It's getting cold and smelly. My odor-eaters are going critical. 
",6720709,Zoidberg," Maybe we can plotz in that giant cockle. 
",4320710,Amy," Shmeepers, it's the Land Titanic, the biggest and onlyest land boat ever constructed...
",8920711,Hermes," This was one hell of a bus.
",2920712,Zoidberg," Well, everyone debone a bunk and get some shut-eye. 
",5420713,Farnsworth," Zoidberg, show some respect! This is a sacred shrine to the thousands who lost their lives.
",9320714,Amy,"  Hey, I found a safe!
",2320715,Farnsworth," It's coming loose. Hand me some more of that cruise director.  The original passenger manifests. 
",9920716,Hermes," Spreadsheets were so elegant back then.
",4120717,Farnsworth," Just one other item. 
",2320718,Amy," It's jewelry. Jewelry! It's jewelry, people!
",4620719,Farnsworth," It's a priceless quantum-force gemerald. 
",4320720,Zoidberg," What's that enscribbled on it?
",3220721,Hermes,"  ""My dear Mrs. Astor. My love for you is as unsinkable as this land ship and as brilliant as this stone. Dictated but not read, Mr. Astor.""
",14120722,Amy," Aw! That's so valuable.
",2520723,Fry," Yeah, I'll never have love like that. Leela hates me now.   Did you guys know I have a crush on Leela? 
",10520724,Munda," What's a matter, Leela? You've hardly touched your toilet clams.
",6620725,Leela,"  Maybe I was too harsh on Fry. He didn't ruin my life on purpose.
",6720726,Morris," Things will work out, honey. Now here, have some more of what looks like lemonade. 
",8520727,Bubblegum," Bender, I've been to wang dang doodles all up and down the galaxy, but this is the dangest wang I ever doodled.
",11320728,Bender," Oh, yeah! Come on baby, let's do it.  Shake your booty, baby. Come on, yeah!  Get out! Get out! It's not fun anymore! I wanna be alone!
Hedonism Bot: Alone with me?
",16620729,Bender," I said scram, grapey! 
",2420730,Leela," Fry? What are you doing.
",2620731,Fry,"  You were right. I don't know what it's like to be a mutant. But I want to know.
",8220732,Leela," Wait, I never meant for you to...  Oh, no!  Fry! Fry! No! No! 
",6420733,Fry," Any effect?
",1320734,Leela,"  Sorry. I tried to scream but I barfed.
",4120735,Fry," I think I'm knowing what it's like to be a mutant.
",5220736,Zoidberg," So, what's with all the screaming?
",3620737,Fry," Hey, guys.
",1220738,Leela," Fry, this is the stupidest, sweetest thing you've ever done. And you know, maybe now, together, we can be an inspiration to other mutants.
",14020739,Fry," I hope so, Leela.
",1920740,Leela," Aw. Come here. Let me give you a kiss.  Hug.  Handshake.  I'll text ya.
",7320741,Fry," My fellow mutants, until recently, I dwelt on the surface where a man can gaze up at the sky in wonder without a wet clump falling in his mouth.
",14620742,Mutant #1,"  We can do that too. 
",2320743,Leela," Who's ready to fight for equality?  The Devolution Revolution has begun! Beautiful mutants, please welcome Devo!
",11420744,Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh," Hello, Sewer City.  As long-time mutants ourselves, we support your righteous struggle and will do anything we can for you.
Dwayne: Play ""Whip It""!
",14920745,Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh," No.  Play the other one.
",2620746,Leela," Now that we got their attention, it's time to hit them where they sit, by bending the West Side Pipeway to return all sewage to the surface.
",14220747,Fry," But who could possibly bend such a huge pipe?
",4720748,Bender," So lonely. Poor, sad Bender.
",3020749,Fry," Hey, buddy.
",1320750,Bender,"  Ah, what the heck? 
",2220751,Mutant #1s," Bend it! Bend it! Bend it!
",2820752,Fry," What goes down, must back up!
",3120753,Sal,"  Yucks. I picked the wrong day to wear my new Crocses.
",5620754,Leela," Prepare to storm the surface for the Million Mutant March.
",6020755,Colonel," Move out, Fry. We need out most disgusting mutant leading the charge.
",7120756,Fry,"  I'll meet you up there. I need to check out something first.
",6320757,Colonel," Okay. Vyolet, you're up front.
",3220758,Vyolet," Hey!
",620759,Mrs. Astor," Mayor, this sewage debacle has gone on long enough. As your largest campaign contributor, I demand action!
",10820760,Poopenmeyer," Very well. $80 worth of action it is.
",3920761,Poopenmeyer," VoilÃ ! We simply pump the fruits of our excretion into Madison Cube Garden.
",7720762,Mrs. Astor," Well, it seems everything is under... 
",4020763,Vyolet," Two!
",620764,Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh," Four!
",720765,Colonel," Six eyes!
",1120766,Mutant #1s," The mutant people will arise.
",3120767,Leela," The segregation of the mutant people ends today. We demand equal rights, equal access to the surface, and the blood of your first-born children.  That so we have something to give up at the negotiations.
",20520768,Mrs. Astor," I've never been so moved, and I see no reason to begin now. Hobsy, flush those creatures back into the hole they crawled out of.
",13020769,Hobsy," Madam's sewage seeking missile.
",3320770,Fry,"  Let my people stay! [He shoots a beam of energy at the wave of sewage, parting it.
",8520771,Bender," Neat! 
",820772,Fry," Mrs. Astor, deep in the sewers, we discovered the wreck of the Land Titanic, on which your husband land-drowned. Inside was something that might interest you.
",16020773,Mrs. Astor," The gemerald ring that my husband was to give me in lieu of children.  So what, I have a chandelier in my car made of those.
",12620774,Fry," Not the gem. This passenger manifest. It turns out there were mutants on that ship, working below deck in the sewage galley.
",12620775,Leelas grandmother," I was just a young girl.  Drain angels, they called us. When the ship started going down.  My mother grabbed me and made for the nearest life-car.  But the places were all taken by surface passengers. As my mother held me tight, I suddenly felt the gentle tap of a cane on my face. I turned to see the kindly smile of Mr. Astor.   Thanks to your husband's humanity, I lived to raise my own daughter, and she, a daughter in turn.
",43020776,Leela," Mom, why have I never heard this?
",3520777,Munda,"  My mother's nuts.
",2020778,Fry," I beg you, Mrs. Astor, if you truly want to honor your husband's memory, treat these people with dignity, as he did.
",11820779,Mrs. Astor," Oh, he was a dear man, Mr. Astor.  Randall, let's grant these mutants their freedom.
",8620780,Poopenmeyer," Okay.
",720781,Dwayne," Are we not men now?
",2120782,Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh," I'm forty percent potato, but close enough.
",4520783,Leela," Thank you, Fry. I think maybe I can stomach that kiss now.
",6020784,Fry," What the...?
",1420785,Mr. Astor," Good afternoon. I am Mr. Astor. I did not perish that fateful day, but rather plummeted into the toxic lake, where I mutated and lived in solitude until this ruddy lad here stepped into my mouth and lodged there.
",21420786,Mrs. Astor," Mister? Is that really you? 
",3020787,Zoidberg," Horray! A happy ending for the rich people!
",4520788,Leela," Mom, Dad, Grandma, this is where I work.
",4220789,Munda," Oh! Was there a fire?
",2320790,Amy," So, Bender, how was the party?
",3220791,Bender," Only the greatest party ever! I don't need to have another party in my whole life. I am partied out!
",10220792,Fry," Dang! Sorry we missed it!
",2720793,Bender," We could have another one, if it would make you guys feel better.
",6720794,Fry," Really? No, that's not necessary.
",3520795,Bender," Hit it, Bender! 
",1820796,Transition Announcer #1," It's ""The Futurama Holiday Spectacular""! Brought to you by...
",6320797,Transition Announcer #1," Gunderson's Unshelled Nuts!
",2920798,Amy," Ah, the Xmas season. Who wants a delicious unshelled nut?
",5920799,Bender," Ooh, I'll have one!
",2120800,Amy," Mmm... ""It's NUTSO Good!""
",2720801,Fry," Oh.
",520802,Leela," What's wrong, Fry? Are you regretting another wasted year?
",6020803,Fry," I don't know. Somethin' about Xmas just doesn't feel like Christmas.
",7020804,Farnsworth," Santa's coming! Initiate defenses!
",3620805,Robot #1 Santa," God rest ye, merry gentlemen... in peace! 
",4420806,Fry," Can someone please explain how you celebrate this crazy holiday? Preferably in song?
",8620807,Robot #1 Santa,"  It's the violentest season of the year.
",4220808,Elf,"  Old Kringle-bot has come to spread some mugs of Xmas fear.
",6120809,Robot #1 Santa,"  Sugar-plummy visions will be dancing in your head
When I cane you from the comfort of my sled.
",9720810,Leela,"  On Xmas Eve, we don our gay apparel,
Kevlar vests, asbestos stockings and a barrel.
",8620811,Farnsworth,"  And if Grandma's Xmas fruitcake finally reaches critical mass,
It can be regifted straight to Santa's ass.
",10920812,Robot #1 Santa,"  But the ornamental armaments are merely superficial,
The tinsel and the trappings are just icing on the missile.
The one thing that you need to make your Xmas day splendiferous
Is a pine tree; a pine tree that's coniferous.
",22620813,Planet Express crew,"  We have to have a pine tree as coniferous.
",4520814,Robot #1 Santa," You're welcome.
",1720815,Fry," You know, Santa may have killed Scruffy, but he makes a good point. What we need is an old-fashioned pine tree.
",11320816,Farnsworth," Cram it, Virginia! Pine trees have been extinct for over eight hundred years.
",7920817,Leela," Professor, maybe there's some way to bring the pine trees back to life, like we did with the barking snakes.
",11020818,Farnsworth," Pine trees aren't barking snakes. They won't just turn up in a salad at Olive Garden. But there is one hope, and, as usual, it's Norwegian!
",14120819,Farnsworth," Behold! The Svalbard Global Seed Vault! Since 2008, the vault has preserved seeds of every known plant species in case of extinction.
",13520820,Hermes," And I brought a few seeds of my own.
",3820821,Norwegian seed guard," Halt! Wh-what's your business poky-pokin' about da seed vault, eh, guardian of mankind's precious botanical heritage dere?
",12420822,Farnsworth," We just wanna come in and rummage about a bit.
",4820823,Norwegian seed guard," Oh. So... okay. 
",1820824,Bender," Yo, ABBA, what's that next door?
Norwegian seed guard: Oh, dat's da germ warfare repository.
",9420825,Leela," It's so close! Is there any chance of cross-contamination?
",6020826,Norwegian seed guard," No.
",520827,Norwegian seed guard," Now, your pine trees were all chopped down to make imirgincee toilet paper durin' th' fifty-year squirts. Lucky da seeds have bin preserved here in da vault der.
",16320828,Amy," What's that splork on them?  It's not germs, is it?
",5320829,Norwegian seed guard," No.
",520830,Fry," Now that's a tree worth chopping down.
",4020831,Tinny Tim," Indeed. 'Tis a loverly tree. 'Twould truly be my finest Xmas eve-
",6720832,Nixon," Araroo!
",920833,Nixon," That's what my poll numbers need: Happy voters enjoying some holiday cheer.
",7720834,Cheney," As your Vice President, I order you to steal that tree.
",5720835,Nixon," My fellow Earthicans, welcome to the Annual White House Xmas Tree Lighting, brought to you by Gunderson's Nuts!
",11320836,Amy," Oh, no! Could the seed have been contaminated by a virus from the germ vault?
",7920837,Norwegian seed guard," Oh, yeh, I suppose.
",2120838,Leela," Wait, this could be a good thing. That weaponized virus made the sickly little tree grow big and strong.
",10620839,Leela," Wait, this could be a good thing. Reforestation has begun.
",6020840,Bender," Aw, jeez with this, hey?
",2620841,Leela," Arguably, this could be a good thing. The planet has returned to its primeval state.
",8620842,Fry," Earth is just the way it was before the white man came!
",5720843,Farnsworth," Good news! All these pine trees are fighting global warming by producing oxygen. Happy now, Gore?
",9920844,Gore," Yeah, but I'd be happier if I had a set of lungs.
",5120845,Farnsworth," Wait a second! Oxygen levels are rising too rapidly! 10%... 20% ...60%!
",7320846,Gore," As long as it doesn't hit 70!
",3120847,Farnsworth," 80%!
",620848,Bender," Y'know, I don't recall having done anything for a while. But I still feel like I deserve a smoke.  Hey, cool, the air's on fire.
",13020849,Robot #1 Santa," Ho ho ho! Everyone's dead!  Stay tuned for another tale of holiday hilarity!
",7820850,Transition Announcer #1," Now, back to...
",1720851,Transition Announcer #1," ...the Gunderson's Nuts Holiday Spectacular featuring Futurama!
",6520852,Farnsworth," Okay, crew. Xmas break is over. It's time to destroy these gifts we forgot to deliver.
",8820853,Bender," Woah, woah, woah! How come we get off for every dumb human holiday but not for robot holidays?
",9620854,Leela," Oh, Lord, not Robanukah.
",2620855,Bender," I'm talkin' about Robanukah, the holiest six and a half weeks in the robot calendar!
",8620856,Amy," Pfft! That's just a fake holiday you make up every year to get out of work.
",7720857,Fry," Yeah, if it's real, how come there's no song that explains how you celebrate it?
",8220858,Bender," Because there is! Hit it!
",2720859,Farnsworth," Hit what?
",1120860,Bender," I've placed instruments under your seats. Play 'em or I'll break 'em over your heads!
",8720861,Bender,"  Robanukah may sound as if it's Jewish,
But its ancient sounding customs are exceptionally newish.
So take a hearty swallow from your robo-kiddish cup,
Which will give me time to quickly make them up.
",20220862,Hermes,"  Do you spin a dreidel made from clay?
",4020863,Bender,"  Mine is called a droidel and it's rigged to make you pay.
",6020864,Amy,"  Do you eat these dummy tin-wrapped chocolate coins?
",5420865,Bender," Better!  We got fembots with illegal five-speed groins!  Shalom, Ruth and Esther!
",8320866,Ruth," Why with the music so loud?
",2920867,Esther," Would it kill him to turn up the heat a little in here?
",5720868,Bender,"  But by far the most important thing is oil.
",4620869,Leela,"  To keep the lamp light burning or to help the latkes broil?
",6220870,Bender,"  No, we pour the holy lubricant out from the sacred vessel
Into this blessed pit so they can wrestle.
",10320871,Planet Express crew,"  The extra made-up touch that makes Robanukah so special
Is the oil in which the nasty fembots wrestle.
",10520872,Bender," We shall now begin the traditional oil wrestling. Will the referee bring out the ceremonial crudes of petroleum oil?  Thank you, Abraham. 
",14020873,Ruth," Not in the hair, please. I just had it did.
",4520874,Bender," Aw, no! These broads are s'posed to wrestle for six and a half weeks! But there's only enough petroleum oil for four and a half weeks!
",13620875,Esther," We're still gettin' paid, right?
",3420876,Bender," I told you it's an audition!
",3020877,Leela," Bender, four and a half weeks of oil wrestling sounds like plenty.
",6820878,Bender," This isn't a lousy reform Robanukah! We need more petroleum oil!
",6620879,Hoschel," I got me some whale oil, some squirrel oilâ€”
",4520880,Bender," Not kosher! It has to be petroleum oil! Do you not give a damn about the hallowed traditions of Robanukah?!
",10920881,Hoschel," I reckon I do not. Anyways, Earth done run out of petroleum oil.
",6620882,Gore," I tried to warn you.  One unit of free limitless solar power please.
",7020883,Hoschel," That'll be... I dunno... ten bucks?
",3720884,Gore," Um, can you make change for a Nobel Prize?
",4420885,Bender," Aw, man! Can't we just make more petroleum oil?
",4920886,Farnsworth," I'm afraid not, son.  Petroleum only forms when organic matter is subjected to intense pressure for hundreds of millions of years.
",13220887,Fry," I can't wait that long! I've got ADD!
",3920888,Bender," This is so unfair!
",2020889,Ruth," I don't wrestle dry, Bender. I went to Vassar.
",4820890,Bender," Professor, I want you to look these poor floozies in the eye and tell them their oil wrestling days are over.
",11120891,Farnsworth,"  I suppose there could be a minute quantity of petroleum left. But it would be insanely deep within the Earth, at pressures so dangerously high thatâ€”
",15120892,Bender," Let's go already!
",1920893,Leela," Setting Bachman turners to overdrive.
",3920894,Hermes," We're getting pretty deep.  Look! Mole coffins!
",4920895,Amy," Oh, no! We tunneled into a tunnel!
",3620896,Zoidberg," What's that loud, boring sound you'll hear when I stop talking? 
",6620897,Farnsworth,"  It's an albino humping worm!
",3120898,Fry," Why do they call it that? 
",2820899,Farnsworth," Because it doesn't have any pigment.
",3820900,Farnsworth," What's our depth, Captain?
",2820901,Leela," Forty kilometers. Fifty!
",2620902,Bender," There must be petroleum oil down here somewhere. Go deeper! Deeper!
",6920903,Farnsworth," No, Bender! The ship can't withstand this much pressure! Sometimes it falls apart just sitting in the hangar!
",11120904,Bender," Professor, I've never asked for anything before, but seeing those fembots glistening with oil means more to me than life itself.
",13020905,Farnsworth,"  Oh, call me an old fool, but I believe the Lord is speaking through you.  Brace yourselves, everyone!
",10420906,Leela," One hundred kilometers! Two hundred!
",3820907,Amy," I hate to complain about the heat, but the air conditioner is on fire!
",7220908,Hermes,"  My ice cream manwich!
",2420909,Leela," What the hell are we doing? We're all gonna die so this ""junkyard Golem"" can celebrate Robanukah.
",9920910,Bender," You vile racist! Haven't my people suffered enough? Now keep drilling for that petroleum oil, you selfish cowards! Although, then again, I guess any kind of oil would be just as-
",18020911,Everybody else," Aah! 
",720912,Bender,"  Not my fault.
",1620913,Bender," I am so great! Bender is great! Bender, Bender, Bender--  Man, where'd the time go?  Hey, you guys wannaâ€” Oh. Right.  They turned into petroleum oil! I thought they were selfish, yet in the end it turned out it was I who thought they were selfish!
",24920914,Bender," Doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-Doo, DOO!
",5720915,Bender," Hey, ladies, I found some... What theâ€”?  There was only enough petroleum for four and a half weeks of oil wrestling. But it lasted 500 million years! It's a miracle!
",16720916,Bender," Happy Robanukah, everyone! Coming up next, more thoughtful, interfaith hijinx!
",8020917,Transition Announcer #1," And now, the unrelated conclusion.
",3620918,Leela," LaBarbara, Hermes, happy Kwanzaa. We brought a chocolate cake. But now I'm worried that might be offensive in some way.
",12120919,Labarbara," Just sit down.
Bubblegum: Happy Kwanzaa, brother men and sister men.
",7020920,Hermes," Well, look at the cat the cat dragged in.
",4320921,Bubblegum," Kwanzaa tradition encourages educational gifts. So I brought Dwight my book on Mathketball. 
",9420922,Dwight," Woah! Let me see that. 
",2520923,Bubblegum," I'll sign it for you later.
",2920924,Barbados," Mon, it's a cold one out there.
",3320925,Hermes," Barbados Slim?
",1620926,Labarbara," Come in, Barbados. Look at yourself, all throbbing and shirtless for the holiday. I hope you're ready to celebrate.
",11720927,Barbados," All night long, woman. 
",2520928,Hermes," I'm glad you all could be here with my family. Kwanzaa traditions are quite ancient, dating back over 1,000 years.
",11620929,Fry," Woah!
",720930,Zoidberg," If only someone could tell us more about these traditions. 
",6120931,Kwanzaabot," Oh, yeah!
",1120932,Dwight," Hey, Kool-Aid's here.
",2320933,Labarbara," No, child. That's not a made-up character. It's Kwanzaa-bot.
",6220934,Kwanzaabot," And I'm gonna tell you all how we celebrate Kwanzaa. Zoidberg, lay down a beat.
",8120935,Zoidberg," How about I just lay down?
",2820936,Kwanzaabot," The seven basic principles that go to make up Kwanzaa!
",5620937,Labarbara," Kujichagulia...
",1720938,Barbados and Bubblegum," And umoja...
",1420939,Hermes," And the rest.
",1520940,Planet Express crew," Now we get it!
",1620941,Kwanzaabot," Sit back down! There's gonna be a test.
",4120942,Bubblegum," Cooperative economics.
",2420943,Kwanzaabot," Yo, boondocks, I'm talkin' here! Put away the comics!
",5520944,Barbados," Like the ever-changing nature of my sexual proclivities.
",5820945,Kwanzaabot," I think there's one called ""nia,"" but I don't speak Swahili,
",6220946,Farnsworth," That's from Xmas and Robanakuh, you plagiarizing lout!
",5620947,Kwanzaabot," Yeah, I'm kinda losin' interest here. I'd best be rollin' out.
",6420948,Dwight," What's that, Black Santa?
",2720949,Kwanzaabot," You need seven Kwanzaa candles that you light up every night.
",6320950,Planet Express crew," They must be made of beeswax or we might as well be white.
",6020951,Labarbara," Well, we got no beeswax candles, but these scented regular wax candles will do just fine.
",9120952,Kwanzaabot," Girl, those stink sticks are for single women who take baths. If your Kwanzaa candles ain't 100% beeswax, you bring shame on your people.
",13920953,Labarbara," Well, now that won't do. Husband, show a little ku'umba and fetch some beeswax before Kwanzaa ends.
",10120954,Hermes," Sweet candelabra of La Habra, LaBarbara! Isn't this the last night of Kwanzaa?
",8020955,Kwanzaabot," Who the hell knows?
",2120956,Hermes," Finally, a bee farm that's open late on Kwanzaa. Madam, I need beeswax.
",7320957,Petunia," You sure you don't need a little honey, handsome? Maybe a taste of sweet nectar straight from the hive?
",10520958,Hermes," I just need some beeswax to make Kwanzaa candles.
",5120959,Petunia," Well, that's too darn bad. There ain't no beeswax in the whole world.
",7120960,Amy," Oh, no! This could be the year without a Kwanzaa, like every year before 1966.
",8020961,Petunia," The bees are acting all crazy: like they've been drinking Tang and cough syrup, or as I call it, my Friday night. 
",11620962,Farnsworth,"  My God! It's Colony Collapse Syndrome. The bees are swarming with parasites. They're all dying.
",9820963,Petunia," Yeah, but what a way to go. ""Die young and leave a pretty corpse,"" that's what I say.
",8720964,Bender," You should say someth'n' else.
",3220965,Fry," Wait. I know where we can get beeswax. From those giant space bees that nearly killed us, and we swore we'd never go back there.
",13020966,Farnsworth," Let's go back there!
",2220967,Farnsworth," To communicate with the bees, we'll need to use these trans-bumbalators. Bender, say something in bee talk.
",10920968,Leela," I'm sorry, Bender. What do you want me to put on the glass?  Okay, if we survive.
",8320969,Amy," Something's wrong. It's way too quiet.
",4020970,Fry," Like the deadly Prius.
",2420971,Farnsworth," Ah, here they come.
",2120972,Leela," They're in attack formation. They're going to kill us!  That was weird. It's like the JÃ_germeister air show all over again.
",12520973,Hermes," According to Google Hive, we're at the exact center of the honeycomb. Oh! And there's a Jamba Juice point 2 miles that way.
",12520974,Bender," Does that thing tell you where the Queen Bee is? The big, fat, ugly, compound-eyed, hairy-thoraxed...
",10320975,Queen,"  Don't be applying your Eurocentric standards of beauty to me, fool. 
",7120976,Hermes," What's with the kamikaz-bees?
",3120977,Queen," Man, my hive's been going buck-wild since these blood-ganking butt crabs moved in.
",8420978,Zoidberg," Been there, done that.
",2420979,Farnsworth," They're all infected, just like the bees on Earth.
",5220980,Queen," Brother-sucking parasites gone and disrupted our hivemind. Now, instead of working in harmony, my bees just talk smack to each other.
",13520981,Bee #1 #1," Are you all black with yellow stripes or yellow with black stripes?
",6920982,Bee #1 #2," Yellow with black stripes, man.
",3320983,Bee #1 #1,"  Why don't you just move along?
",3320984,Bee #1 #3," Let me ask you something, you sting my wife?
",4620985,Bee #1 #4," What kind of buzzing question is that? Where do you get the wings big enough to ask me that? 
",9520986,Leela,"  Okay, gang. We have plenty of beeswax. Let's get back to the ship.
",6920987,Hermes," No, we're not going anywhere. I can't abide all this bee-on-bee conflict. It's time to African-Americanize these honeybees. Listen up, bees. It's Kwanzaa, a time of Umoja.
",17320988,Amy," It means unity.
",1720989,Hermes," You have to learn to work together again.
",4320990,Queen," The crazy tablecloth-man is right. It's time to set aside our differences.
",7620991,Bee #1 #1,"  Black stripe, yellow stripe. At the end o' day, we're just a couple of darn talking space bees.
",9820992,Bee #1 #3," Hey, forget about it. Come here and give me a sting. 
",5520993,Farnsworth," Look, the spirit of Kwanzaa is killing the parasites.
",5520994,Fry," Yuck, but yay!
",1620995,Queen," Thank you, my human brother. Your message of unity has touched our souls. We are once again of a single hive-mind.
",11620996,Kwanzaabot," Oh, yeah.
",1120997,Zoidberg," Hurray! Kwanzaa-bot's here to saveâ€”  Aw, they killed him.
",5920998,Hermes," Joyous Kwanzaa, everybody.
",2820999,Gore," Don't worry, the Futurama crew will be back next year, with all-new episodes featuring Bender, Leela and me, Al Gore, as Captain Lance Starman.  And from all of us here at Gunderson's Nuts, happy holidays.
",20721000,Farnsworth," Who likes good news?  Everyone.  Then good news, everyone! Our next delivery isn't to some dangerous, outer-space planet. It's to Earth!
",13821001,Fry," Earth is dangerous. I fell off my chair there once.  Ow! Quit it, Earth.
",7421002,Leela," We won't even have to leave New New York! The package is going to Long Long Island.
",8521003,Farnsworth," Yes, to the lavish Mafia-style villa of the Donbot.
",5321004,Bender," The Donbot?!  The vicious Robot gangster?!  I'd better use my special Robot vision to see what's inside.  It looks like a pair of clamps!
",13921005,Clamps," When are those new clamps gonna get here?  These are all rusted-out with snitch juice!
",8821006,Donbot," Patience, Clamps.  It is my eldest daughter's wedding day.  You don't want the Space Pope to see a clampin' now, do ya?
",12121007,Clamps," Aw, jeez. I forgot my Pope manners.
",3721008,Space Pope," Dearly beloved,  it is with great speed that I now pronounce you husband and wife.
",8421009,Donbot," What theâ€”
",1121010,Joey Mousepad," May I help you with some assistance?
",3821011,Leela," Delivery for...  Francis X. Clampazzo?
",4021012,Joey Mousepad," We don't got nobody here by that alias.
",4121013,Clamps,"  Hey! Hey! That's me.  Are those my new clamps?
",4921014,Joey Mousepad," Your name's Francis?
",2221015,Bender," Guys, look. It's Calculon. And the Robot Devil!  And an open bar!  What's not to sneak into?
",9421016,Leela," Bender, you can't crash a mob wedding.
",4021017,Bender," You forget, Leela, I'm Bender, owner of disguise.
",5121018,Space Pope," And now, ladies and gentlemen, my good friend... Calculon!
",6021019,Calculon," Hey, this one's for the new couple.  It's your day. It's all about you.  Who's that singing at your wedding? It's Calculon!  Calculon!  Calculon!
",14721020,Bender," Ay! Oh! Piscopo!  This guy!  Bada-boing!  Hey, sexy. I'm Bender. What brings you to this tacky soirÃ©e?
",10421021,Donbots eldest daughter," I'm the bride!
",1621022,Bender," Oops.  How 'bout you, baby? Wanna do it?
",4221023,Fanny," Bender, it's me, Fanny!
",2521024,Bender," You who?
",1021025,Fanny," The Donbot's wife? We had an affair?
",3821026,Bender," An affair, huh? Sounds like me.   Jeez, I'd better be a little more careful. I don't wanna hit on anybody I already had sex with.
",13121027,Fanny,"  Hiya, Bella!
",1521028,Bella," Hi, Mom!
",1021029,Bender," What about you? You're my third choice.
",4121030,Bella," Oh, Bender! This is all happening too slowly. Let's get married!
",6621031,Bender," Quiet! I'm makin' out with a floozy!  Hold your clapper. Someone's comin'!
",7621032,Calculon," Donbot, please. I'll pay you back as soon as you lend me some more money.
",7521033,Donbot," Sorry, Calculon. It gives me no joy to do this... Because Clamps will be doin' it.  Clamps, here are your new clamps.
",11921034,Clamps," Clamps!
",921035,Calculon," No. No!  Line?   No!
",2221036,Bella," Yeah, Daddy hates welchers. The only thing he hates worse is witnesses...   And guys who mess around with his daughters...
",12421037,Bella,"  And attempt to duplicate his meatball recipe.
",4821038,Leela," How was the wedding, Bender?
",3021039,Bender," Says who?!  I didn't witness anything!
",4021040,Morbo,"  In entertainment news, two-time Oscar-pool winner Calculon was brutally clamped yesterday by an unknown assailant.
",11721041,Amy," Poor Calculon.
",1621042,Bender,"  Alright, Amy, you win!  The mob did it. I saw the whole thing while also having hot sex with the Donbot's daughter.  I'm scared and great at sex!
",14821043,Leela," Bender, you need to go to the police and tell them a tastefully edited version of what you just said.
",10321044,Bender," What, and have the Mafia come after me too?!  No way!  This secret goes to my grave!
",8621045,Male voice,"  The Bureau is offering anyone with information about this gangland-style clamping a fifty-dollar reward.
",10721046,Bender,"  Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Andâ€” And then Calculon said, ""No. No!""
",5621047,Bender,"  ""No!""  And, then, I ate some excellent meatballs.  Can I have my fifty bucks now?
",8421048,Robot #1 Stack," I enjoyed your story.  Especially the tasteful love scene.  But it's not enough to convict the Donbot. You'll have to testify... In open court.
",14521049,Bender," No. No! Can I have another fifty dollars?
",4321050,Robot #1 Stack," No.
",521051,Bender," No?
",521052,Robot #1 Stack," No!
",521053,Bender,"  No!
",621054,Bailiff," All rise for the honourable Judge 723.
",4021055,Judge #1," Be seated. Organised crime is a plague on our society and I will not tolerate any form of intimidation duringâ€”
",11221056,Bailiff," All rise for the honourable Judge 724.
",4021057,Judge #1," Good day. I'd like to say I'm prepared to tolerate several, if not all, forms of intimidation during this trial. Prosecutor?
",12621058,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, the prosecution pecks for a mistrial on the grounds of jury tamperin'!
",8521059,Judge #1," Donbot?
",921060,Donbot," Motion denied.
",1621061,Judge #1," Prosecutor, call your first witness.
",3821062,Hyper-Chicken," The people call our star witness Mr. X, whose appearance will be altered because he's in grave danger.
",10421063,Bella,"  Bender, I've been looking for you! Which cake do you like better for our wedding?!
",8521064,Donbot," Bender?
",921065,Bender,"  Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!  That was close.
",5121066,Yellow and red manbot," Isn't it true, Mr. X, that you were slandering this innocent Mafioso to distract from your own felonious past?  Including the crime you made up yourself called burglarcenarsony?
",17921067,Bender," That's a wholly-owned trademark of RodrÃ_guez Crime Concepts Inc.! Besides, I'm not on trial here!
",9921068,Judge #1," That's true.  You're on trial in courtroom three.
",5121069,Judge #1," You are charged with two counts of burglarcenarsony. How do you plead?
",7221070,Bender," Not inno-guilty-cent!
",2321071,Bender,"  And then the Donbot said, ""Sorry, Calculon.""
",4721072,Bender," And then Calculon said,  ""No!""
",3221073,Donbot," I think we've heard enough.
",2921074,Bender," Wait, I'm not finished. Oh!  Now I'm finished.
",4821075,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, the prosecution roosts.
",3821076,Judge #1," Have you reached a verdict?
",2921077,Hedonism Bot," Indeed. After a steamy twelve-way deliberation, we find the accused guilty asâ€”
",8021078,Calculon,"  Wait!  The Donbot is innocent!
",3321079,Judge #1," Calculon, who is that escorting you?
",3821080,Hedonism Bot," Yes. Who?
",1121081,Calculon,"  My personal trainer.  And he's trained me to say that my wounds were self-inflicted.  For, you see,  I'm a big Hollywood idiot dumb guy what does that sorta thing.
",16621082,Joey Mousepad," Perfect.
",1021083,Hedonism Bot," We find the Donbot...
",2321084,Calculon," Dramatic pause...
",1921085,Hedonism Bot,"  Not guilty!
",1421086,Amy," What?
",721087,Donbot," Honey, if you're marryin' Bender, ya might wanna get a black dress for the wedding.
",8521088,Bella," That's gonna look hot!
",2421089,Robot #1 Stack," Don't be scared, Bender. We're putting you in the witness relocation programme.  You'll be given a new identity, a new place to live, and this iPod.  I don't want it anymore.
",17621090,Bender," So I gotta hide forever?!
",2721091,Robot #1 Stack," No. Just until the Robot Mafia finds and kills you.  They're pretty good at that.
",8321092,Bender," Goodbye, Professor.  Before I leave, I just want you to know I've never done any work whatsoever.  Zoidberg, I know it seems like I can't stand you.  Leela, you'll have to watch out for Fry now.
",19621093,Leela," Oh, Lord.
",1121094,Fry," I wish I could go with you, pal.
",3421095,Bender," Me too. I'll need a butler.
",2921096,Robot #1 Stack," Bender, we have to go.
",2421097,Farnsworth,"  There'll never be another like him.   Let's hire someone better!
",6721098,Donbot," Clamps.  Clamps!
",1821099,Clamps,"  Huh?
",721100,Donbot," Listen to my boss words. I would like you to apply for Bender's old job and cosy up to this Fry, his best friend.
",11521101,Clamps," Yeah. And I'll introduce 'im to my best friend.   Clamp number one!   Sorry, toots.
",8521102,Donbot," No, Clamps. No clamps. Sooner or later, Bender will contact Fry... As relocated squealers always do.
",10221103,Joey Mousepad," Then with the clamps... Francis.
",3421104,Clamps," Francis? Francis?!  I'll clamp you with the Francis!
",5421105,Joey Mousepad," Ay! Oh! Take it ease.
",2321106,Clamps," Hey there, Slick. I'm 'ere about the job.
",4321107,Hermes," Take a seat.  We'll begin the interview shortly.
",5021108,Hermes," We'll start with Andrew.
",2621109,Clamps," Yeah, they all kinda broke. So... When do I start?
",5221110,Hermes," Everyone, this is Francis.
",2821111,Fry," Hey, Francis.
",1521112,Farnsworth," Hello, Francis.
",1721113,Leela," Hello.
",821114,Amy," Cute name.
",1221115,Hermes," Look what he can do.
",2221116,Clamps," Yeah, I do it all. Clampin', crimpin', occasional snippin'.
",6121117,Farnsworth," Snipping?  Looks like you may be out of a job, Zoidberg.
",5821118,Zoidberg," That's all good fun. But, of course, a clamp is no substitute for the precision of a genuineâ€”
",9521119,Amy," Francis, would you do the honours?
",3621120,Zoidberg,"  Stay off my turf!
",2021121,Clamps," Eesh.  That guy can bite my shiny metal clamps.
",4921122,Fry,"  You remind me of my old friend Bender.
",4121123,Clamps," Oh, yeah? Where does he safely live?
",3821124,Fry," I dunno. Hey, you wanna come to my house and play?
",5221125,Clamps," Yeah. Sounds like freakin' fun.
",3321126,Clamps," Four stinkin' years of clampin' school for this?
",5021127,Zoidberg,"  Greetings, Francis.  Sorry if I was a little hostile before, but snipping is the only reason I'm even tolerated around here. Not like you, with those magnificent squeezers!
",17521128,Clamps," Squeezers? Squeezers?!  They're clamps, you !  And if I wanna -in' snip with these clamps, I will snip with these -ing clamps!  Why do you think they call meâ€”  Francis?
",17021129,Farnsworth," Eh, Francis, I have good news. It's time for your first delivery...  To the Moon!
",8321130,Clamps," Fan--in'-tastic!
",1821131,Fry," Here's the two-hundred feet of rope you ordered, Sheriff Burley.
",6621132,Sheriff Burley," Hot diggety! You fellas wanna stick around for the hangin' tomorrow? It's gonna be a doozy.  I sure do love hangin' people.  Well, best start cuttin' the nooses.
",16321133,Leela," Oh! You know who could help with that?!  Francis!
",5121134,Leela," Nice job, Francis! I liked how you didn't get drunk and steal anyone's organs. Like our old Robotâ€”
",10021135,Fry," Bender?!  Bender! It's me, Fry!
",3321136,Donbot,"  I knew Bender would turn up purely by coincidence. Take care of 'im, but do it quietly.
",9021137,Clamps," Don't worry. We're in space. Where no one can hear you clamp!
",6321138,Hermes," What do you know? The Feds gave Bender a new identity as a Moon farmer.
",7321139,Fry," Well, he must be afraid to break character in case there's any Robot Mafia scuzzballs around.
",9521140,Clamps," Huh?
",621141,Amy," Come on! Let's go check on 'im!
",3321142,Clamps,"  I checked on a guy once.  I checked 'im into tiny pieces!
",6021143,Hydroponic Farmer," Bender?! Nope, don't recollect nobody by that name. But let me ask my son-in-law.   Billy!
",9221144,Bender," Yes, Moon pa?
",1521145,Hydroponic Farmer," These nice, big-city hillbillies are lookin' for someone named Bender. You know 'im?
",8621146,Bender," No, he ain't any of the eight people I ever met.
",5021147,Fry," Bender, it's us, your friends. You can drop the hillbilling moron act.
",7221148,Bender," Sorry, mister, but I'm no Bender. I'm just a simple farmer. Name's Billy West!
",8021149,Fry," Billy West. What a stupid, phony, made-up name!
",4921150,Hydroponic Farmer," You city folk are probably hungry from premarital sex and flag burnin'. Y'all wanna stay for supper?
",10221151,Amy," Well...  My boyfriend and I were gonna have sex on a burning flag, but...  I could have a bite.
",9721152,Billy West," May I present my beautiful Robot wife, the Crushinator. She's servin' up the dinner and the charm.
",10021153,Crushinator," Mashed chicken, Mr. Fry?
",2621154,Fry," Sure!
",721155,Clamps," So, uh... Billy... Where were you born?
",4121156,Billy West," Right here in Moon country!
",2921157,Farnsworth," And how long have you been a farmer?
",3821158,Billy West," Reckon I was born a farmer. Folks say my momma was a hoe.
",5921159,Leela," Oh, dear! I seem to have warped my fork!  Could you bend it back for me? Billy?
",8121160,Billy West," Bend it?  I can't even lift it. Which is weird... Seein' as how my daddy was a forklift.
",9021161,Leela,"  Wow! Bender is really committed to his new Jethrovian identity!
",6621162,Billy West," If y'all are all finished, I'll drive y'all back to town in the old clunker.
",7821163,Billy West," So... Y'all flew here in a spacey-ship?
",4121164,Hermes," Stop talking like that! You live on the Moon!
",4721165,Fry,"  If that is Bender, I guess he's just happier in his new life.
",6421166,Farnsworth," I refuse to believe anyone is happy! Mr. West, would you mind if I examined your brain?
",8921167,Billy West," Examine? Heck. If you can find it, you can keep it.
",5321168,Farnsworth," Gadzooks!  Bender's hard drive no longer contains any of his old memories. When the Feds bumpkinised him, they completely wiped out his old identity!
",15121169,Billy West," Well, I don't know about that. But who am I to argue with a man from the sky!  So long, space heroes!
",10321170,Fry,"  You sure you don't wanna kill all Humans?
",4421171,Billy West," Pfff! I love all Humans!
",2621172,Fry," He really is gone.
",2021173,Fry,"  I guess I'm happy for 'im. And, honestly, Francis is a way better friend than Bender ever was.  Hey, where is Francis?
",12121174,Billy West," One sasparoil, Sheriff! I'm thirsty!
",3821175,Sheriff Burley," Make it two. I'm greedy.
",2621176,Clamps," You got the rest fooled.  But not me.  Now let's take this outside so's no one else gets clamped.
",9921177,Billy West," You're the boss, stranger!
",2821178,Clamps," I'm gonna clamp your body parts off one by one. But, then, I'm gonna clamp your wounds shut so ya stay alive... While I clamp ya some more. Say your prayers, stoolie.
",16821179,Billy West," Okay!  God bless grandma and grandpaâ€”
",3921180,Clamps," They're next! Right now, I'm gonna cut your damn head off!
",6021181,Zoidberg,"  Drop the Robut.  I thought I told you. I do the cutting around here.
",7121182,Clamps," Scuttle on home.  This ain't none of your business, Slick.
",6021183,Zoidberg," My name isn't Slick. It's Zoidberg.   John -ing Zoidberg!
",5921184,Fry," Stop, Zoidberg!  You'll hurt Francis!
",3921185,Clamps," Oh, yeah? Take this! That that!
",3321186,Zoidberg,"  Oy!
",621187,Clamps," Why, you lousyâ€”  I'm gonna clamp ya!
",3821188,Zoidberg,"  Oy!  Ow. Ow. Ow.
",1921189,Clamps," Looks like an all-you-can-kill lobster fest.
",4621190,Zoidberg," That offer was for a limited time only.
",4121191,Clamps,"  My clamps!
",1321192,Fry," Why, Zoidberg?! Why?!
",2321193,Zoidberg," Because our friend Francis here is in reality... A bad murderer.
",6621194,Billy West," Yup. He was fixin' to kill me.  This here crawdad done saved my life!
",7121195,Bella," Bender, you two-timing jerk!  I put off my singing career for you! And, if I can't have you,  no one can!
",10721196,Billy West," Aw, shucks.
",1321197,Fry," Bender!
",921198,Leela," No!
",521199,Hermes," What?
",721200,Donbot," Bender was a helluva squealer.  Maybe the best there ever was. We'll send his widow some meatballs. Clamps, Bella, get in the way-back.
",13721201,Fry," To my friend Bender. A wise man once said he was a helluva squealer.  Maybe the best there ever was.
",10221202,All," To Bender!
",1221203,Bender,"  You pizzas gonna be another minute.  We are still waitin' for it to be delivered.
",8421204,Fry," Bender?!
",1021205,Bender,"  I'm no Bender. You got me mixed up with another Robot.
",5721206,Fry,"  You're probably right.  I don't really remember what he looks like.
",7021207,Bender," Guys! Guys! It's me, Bender!
",3021208,Fry,"  He's alive!
",1421209,Leela,"  So that Moon hillbilly who got murdered was just an innocent husband and father!
",8321210,Farnsworth," Bender, old bot, the Mafia thinks you're dead! You can come back to work with us!
",8321211,Bender," I'm back, baby!
",1721212,Brown-haired man," Pizza's here.
",1521213,Bender," Woo!  I'll just cut that.
",2721214,Zoidberg," You do and I'll -ing gut you like a fish!
",4321215,Leela," Where's the Professor?
",2421216,Bender," Eh, probably dead. Already dissolving in a bathtub if we're lucky.
",6821217,Farnsworth," I was out on the widow's walk keeping a hopeless vigil for the return of my first delivery crew.  It's been fifty years since they disappeared.
",14521218,Fry," Huh. I knew you had other crews, but you never told us you had a first crew.
",7821219,Farnsworth," I remember it like it was interesting.
",4021220,Farnsworth,"  I had just built my new shipping and receiving emporium.
",5921221,Farnsworth,"  And I scoured the hardware-store parking lot to assemble the finest crew imaginable.
",8721222,Farnsworth,"  There was Candy, the raunchy by-the-books navigator...  Lifter, the devastatingly handsome forklift...  And Captain Lando Tucker, a dedicated young man with no characteristics.
",17921223,Lando Tucker," We'll deliver that package or die trying.
",4321224,Zoidberg," Eh! It's all my favourite patients. And also Captain Tucker. Pow!
",6721225,Candy," Whoa!
",721226,Lando Tucker," You totally got me, Dr. John.  You're hilarious.
",5021227,Hermes," Zoidberg was popular?!
",2421228,Amy," Zoidberg had hair?!
",2121229,Farnsworth," I never said he had hair!  If you chose to imagine 'im that way, that's your business.  Anyway...
",9921230,Farnsworth,"  The time came for our first delivery.
",4021231,Young woman," Lando, don't forget about me and Junior.
",4221232,Lando Tucker," I won't, honey.  Or die trying.
",3321233,Farnsworth," Well, crew, this is it. That cookie bouquet isn't going to deliver itself.
",7621234,Farnsworth,"  Ten...
",921235,Farnsworth,"  Nine and so on. Three...  Two...  One.
",4121236,Scientist," Go, you big metal bird! Get up there!
",3921237,Hermes," Incredible!  Zoidberg had friends?!
",3721238,Zoidberg," It was a different time.
",2621239,Farnsworth,"  Everything was going smoothly until right after that part I was just telling you about.  Suddenly, Amanda's aunt called to say her niece hadn't received her cookie bouquet.
",17521240,Farnsworth,"  I watched the skies for weeks. With only occasional breaks to tender my grief diarrhea.
",9021241,Farnsworth,"  Just when all hope was lost...
",3321242,Farnsworth," The ship's escape pod!  What happened up there, Johnny?
",5721243,Zoidberg," Aw! Don't make me remember! So horrible, it was.
",5021244,Amy," I thought you said he didn't have hair.
",4121245,Farnsworth," Yes, but something he saw on that mission traumatised 'im so severely, he grew hair!  Just so it could turn white! Sadly, my brave crew was gone forever.
",15521246,Leela," That poor, incompetent crew.  What do you think happened, Professor?
",7021247,Farnsworth," They were lost in the Bermuda Tetrahedron!
",4421248,Leela," That's ridiculous.  The Bermuda Tetrahedron is just a myth.
",6121249,Farnsworth," I'm glad you're so brave in the face of the unknown, Leela.  Because, for your next mission, you'll be flying directly through...  The Bermuda Tetrahedron!
",15721250,Leela," Or we could fly around it.
",2821251,Farnsworth," Of course you could! You'd be stupid not to.
",4621252,Bender," Supposing we're not stupid, what kinda stupid mission is this?!
",6521253,Farnsworth," You'll be picking up a monument commemorating my lost crew.  To be unveiled Tuesday at their memorial ceremony. All the grieving families will be there.  Plus, a popsicle cart!
",17821254,Leela," You can count on us, Professor. We'll get that monument here in time.
",7121255,Bender," Hooray!
",921256,Amy," Woohoo!
",921257,Bender," Yeah!
",721258,Leela," Or die trying.
",1621259,Zoidberg," We're gonna tryâ€” What?
",2421260,Green Alien," 'Ere you go. ""In memory of the 1st Planet Express ship and it's crew"".
",7221261,Leela," Hang on.  It's shouldn't have an apostrophe. This means and it is crew. What the hell's wrong with you?!
",10621262,Green Alien," It's a minor error, lady. I mean, we're space Aliens.  It's a miracle we can even speak English.
",9821263,Leela," The miracle is that I'm not kickin' your ass!  I insist you recarve the entire statue correctly.
",9821264,Green Alien," Okay. Okay.  Hey, Charlie! Hack off another block of ivory!
",6121265,Amy,"  Well, the statue's perfect now.
",3421266,Amy," Too bad we won't make it back in time for the memorial service.
Leela: We'll make it. Or die trying.
",10221267,Fry," Whoa!
",721268,Leela," We're cutting through the Bermuda Tetrahedron.
",4821269,Bender," Woo!  Wait. The Bermuda Tetrahedron?
",3821270,Zoidberg," Aw... I think I'm remembering that thing I forgot.
",5221271,Amy," Uh-oh. The dials are terrified!
",3321272,Leela," Brace yourselves. It's Tickle Me Elmo's fire!
",4721273,Bender," Ow.
",521274,Leela," There. See? It was no big thing.
",3421275,Hermes," What was that big thing?
",2621276,Fry,"  It's a spaceship graveyard.   Why did we have to come 'ere at night?
",7121277,Hermes," Look at all these famous lost ships.  There's the Garmin.  And the TomTom.
",7621278,Leela," Over there! It's the original Planet Express ship!
",5221279,Amy,"  What caused all that damage?
",3121280,Amy," Could it've been flavour-blasted?
",3521281,Leela," We'd better investigate.  Looks like an Ion Storm, though.  Everyone suit up!
",7921282,Leela," Whatever happened here, that first crew left in a hurry.  The table is still set from McDonald's value dinner!
",11221283,Zoidberg," I remember. I remember!  This is what traumatised me. Such a meal to got to waste!  And, with that...  I have closure.
",12021284,Amy," Hey, Zoidberg. You're cockatieling.
",3721285,Zoidberg," Oh, no.  Something's happening!  What's happening?!
",5321286,Zoidberg," Oh, right! And there was a giant killer space whale.
",5421287,Bender," Holy crap!  It's a giant space fish!
",3821288,Leela," Actually, the space whale isn't a space fish.  It's a space mammal.
",6921289,Bender," Wow, interesting. I'm both impressed and being eaten.
",5521290,Hermes," Spacewalk, people! Spacewalk for your lives!
",4621291,Fry," Man, look at 'im go! Like a millionaire on a cocktail wiener.
",6321292,Zoidberg,"  Woob.
",821293,Leela," I did it! I outran 'im!
",2521294,Zoidberg," Relax, friends.
",1721295,Zoidberg," Panic, jerks!
",1521296,Hermes," That's no ordinary space whale!  It's a four-dimensional space whale!
",7121297,Amy," Of course! And it only breaches into our 3-D universe to hunt and fill its lungs with vacuum!
",9521298,Leela," Whatever its beef is, our one mission now is to get that monument to Earth.
",7721299,Leela," Correction: Our one mission now is to avenge the loss of that monument.
",7321300,Amy," Shmeesh! He gonked off the engines!
",3721301,Leela," That won't stop me!  Raise the solar sails. I'm goin' after that ""MÃ¶bius Dick"".
",8121302,Hermes," You been hittin' the Red Stripe, woman!
",4121303,Leela," Comport yourself, Mr. Conrad! When we're at space, the Captain's word is law.  I could marry you and Bender against your will if I wanted to.
",14321304,Hermes," You wouldn't dare!
",2021305,Bender," I've been married to worse.
",2921306,Fry," Leela, I'm no doctor, but I'm afraid you be exhibiting symptoms of illin'.  You're risking all our lives for your own personal obsession.
",13921307,Leela," There's nothing personal about this!  That thing screwed up my delivery! This time,  it's business!
",10121308,Leela," Maybe, if I move the compass like this, it will somehow kill the whale.
",7321309,Amy," Leela, we need to talk. You've gone from crazy like a fox to crazy like Fox News!
",8321310,Leela," Fear not the space behemoth.  In my dreams, I've peered beyond its eyes and into the cackling hell within us all.
",11521311,Fry," Okay...  That's a good point.
",3121312,Bender," Fry's right! Let's kill the Captain and order some strippers!   Yeah, what he said.   It's a mutiny led by Fry!
",11321313,Leela," That's enough insubordination, Mr. Fry!
",4121314,Bender,"  String 'im up!
",1721315,Bender," Things look bad enough without having to look closer at them.  Look! Off in the distance! It's exhaling!
",10621316,Leela,"  Use boaty talk!
",1821317,Bender," Thare she blows!
",1821318,Leela," Alright.  Which of you space dogs has the guts and know-how to harpoon that whale?
",8421319,Amy," I spent a semester in Africa harpooning giraffes. And giraffes are basically just land space whales.
",10221320,Leela," Miss Wong, you have the 'poon.
",3221321,Amy," Oh, God! I'm having a Serengeti flashback!  Die, you dirty giraffe!
",6921322,Amy," Well, I got it. Now what, Captain?
",3621323,Leela," You know, I'm not sure.  I guess I thought whales died when you harpooned them.
",8121324,Leela,"  Don't worry.
",1521325,Leela," I'll drop the anchor.
",2321326,Zoidberg," Ouch.
",721327,Hermes," She's diving into the fourth dimension!
",4121328,Amy," We have to cut the rope!
",2621329,Leela," Negative, Sailor Moon.  We're goin' for a sleigh ride.
",5621330,Hermes," I can see sideways in time.
",2921331,Amy," Gee, I see CGI.  IGC ees I, eej.
",3421332,Fry," Poop!  Poop!
",1421333,Bender," Aw, yeah.   Bender! Bender! Bender!
",3721334,Bender," Aw. That was the greatest uncountably infinite bunch of guys I ever met.
",7421335,Amy," Look out!  It's pulling us through a field of spacebergs!
",5921336,Bender," Stupid rocks!  Think they're so great!
",4021337,Amy," Well, they are giant diamonds.
",3221338,Bender," What?!
",821339,Bender," Come to papa!
",1521340,Fry," A lotta Bender fell outta the crow's nest!  We need to cut the line!
",7021341,Leela," Enough of your mad obsession with Bender, Fry! We've got to murder that whale or die trying.
",9421342,Hermes," This has gone too far!  Bender's one of Planet Express' most expensive appliances! And he's in trouble!
",10521343,Leela," That's it!  I warned you. Fry, Zoidberg, I now pronounce you man andâ€”
",7121344,Zoidberg," Aw! So close.
",1521345,Leela," Unsit me, Mr. Conrad. We can't let the whale win! Hi-yah!   You're all too weak!  I can see that now. So I'll have to be my own crew!  Understood?  You've gone mad, Captain.  That's enough outta me!  Now come on! I gotta find that whale.  I found 'im!  With my Oxo Good Grips Cheese knife, I stab at thee.  You do know I'm stabbing at thee, right?
",34921346,Zoidberg," Hello.
",821347,Farnsworth," Think, Zoidberg.  You must remember something!
",4821348,Zoidberg," No! Nothing! For all I know, our friends could've been eaten by some kind of crazy space whale!
",9721349,Farnsworth," Damn that Bermuda Tetrahedron!  It's taken my latest crew just as it took my first one!
",8921350,Zoidberg," Not to mention those single socks from the dryer. Am I right?
",6321351,Farnsworth,"  Shut up, Zoidberg!   Oh, Zoidberg!  The grieving relatives will be gathered here tomorrow in need of comfort.  And, with no stone monument, they may well demand that I refund their admission fees.
",19921352,Leela," Where are we?
Hermes: In the belly of the beast.
",5021353,Fry," Like that Bible guy who got swallowed by the whale! Pinocchio!
",6421354,Amy," This is all Obsessy Bessy's fault!
",3621355,Bender," Right on, sister. We should be back at Planet Express right now. Hiding from work in the ceiling. But no!
",10721356,Leela," For the last time, I'm not obsessed. I just want this whale to die, die, die!
",7921357,Hermes," Uh-oh. What's that loud digesting sound?
",4221358,Fry,"  Holy crap! Four-dimensional bowels!
",3821359,Amy," Einstein was right.
",2121360,Leela," Why?!  Why?!  Also, what and how?!
",3621361,Male voice," The great fish has chosen you for a higher purpose.
",5321362,Leela," It's a great mammal!  See? It's got whiskers! And I saw it lactating earlier.  Wait.  Who said that?
",10221363,Deformed man," I was once Lando Tucker, captain of the first Planet Express ship.
",6821364,Leela," Ew! I'm Turanga Leela, captain of the current Planet Express ship. What's going on?
",8521365,Lando Tucker," It's very simple. Well, actually, it's very complicated. Luckily, I'm here to explain it. You see... This space whale feeds on... Obsession!
",14221366,Leela," Wow. Are you gross-looking. Go on.
",3621367,Lando Tucker," The great space serpentâ€”
",2621368,Leela,"  Mammal.
",1021369,Lando Tucker,"  Figured out long ago that no one's more obsessed than space captains.
",7221370,Leela," Oh!  What are these things?!  Get away!
",4121371,Lando Tucker," The whale's nearly sucked me dry. It'll need a new source of obsession once I'm gone.
",8721372,Leela," How many times do I have to tell other people? I'm not obsessed!
",6621373,Lando Tucker," The whale is obsession, Leela! And you are the whale!
",5521374,Leela,"  I am not the whale! All I wanted was to complete my delivery. Is that too much to ask? One chicken-pickin' delivery? This whale's gonna pay! It can't escape what it already is. Me! I am the whale!   See?
",20621375,Old lady," Fifty years, Junior! Fifty years of grippling sorrow!
",5521376,Paper-hatted salesman," Popsicles here. Can't mourn the dead without a popsicle.
",5821377,Leo," You think a popsicle gonna bring my daughter back?!
",5321378,Paper-hatted salesman," No, sir.
",1021379,Leo," You just talked yourself out of a sale.
",4121380,Mrs. Wong," Poor Amy! My days of joy and luck are over!  Guess I gotta quit that club.
",7621381,Morris," I can't believe our Leela's gone!
",3521382,Munda," You always think you're gonna disappear in space before your children.
",7221383,Farnsworth," Welcome, everyone.  What a pleasure to see so many miserable faces.
",6921384,Zoidberg," Mmm! Lemony!
",1421385,Farnsworth," I had intended to unveil a beautiful stone memorial today. But, due to the recent tragedy, I humbly ask you to join me in a simple prayer.
",14021386,"Munda, Morris, Mrs. Wong, Leo, Dwight, and Labarbara","  Boo!
",721387,Farnsworth," No refunds!  Shut up and bow your heads!  Oh, mighty Isisâ€”
",6021388,Zoidberg," Oh, no!  My deal is doing the thing!
",3821389,Farnsworth," Good Lord! It's some kind of inter-dimensional space whale!
",6121390,Zoidberg," I just remembered.  That's the guy!  Oy! Now with the horror hair.
",6821391,Paper-hatted salesman," Popsicles! Fill your gapin' mouth with a popsicle!
",5221392,Munda,"  Leela!  You're alive!  Is that how you and your friends are dressing now?!
",7721393,Leela," Hello, everyone. I suppose you're wonderin' why my flesh has melded with that of a giant space whale.
",10321394,Farnsworth," I'll admit to a polite interest.
",3421395,Leela," At first, I was consumed by a dark obsession to kill the whale. Then I was consumed by the whale.
",9921396,Zoidberg," That sounds clever, but it doesn't explain much.
",5021397,Leela," Shut up, Zoidberg!
",2021398,Zoidberg," Okay.
",721399,Leela," You see, beneath my obsession lay an even deeper obsession. An obsession so strong, it allowed me to overpower the beast's will and pilot it through space and time. An obsession... With completing my  delivery!
",21221400,Paper-hatted salesman," Get yourâ€”
",1121401,Old lady,"  Poor Lando...  This is just how I want to remember him.
",5821402,Leela," Too bad! 'Cause he's still alive!
",3521403,Old lady," Lando?
",821404,Lando Tucker," Told you I'd be back.   You've grown, Junior.
",4721405,Old Man,"  I'm sixty-one.
",1721406,Mrs. Wong," I dunno him! What else you got?!
",3421407,Farnsworth," They haven't aged a day!  The whale must have some kind of MÃ¶bius colon that endlessly recycles time and space!
",11321408,Scruffy," Yup. That stands up to scrutiny.
",3421409,Leela," I should've listened to my crew.  That space whale wasn't a monster.  It was the obsession of me and others like me that made it into a monster.
",14621410,Lando Tucker," Mainly you.
",1321411,Leela," On the other hand, the stupid fish did eat us. You guys wanna do this?
",7221412,Amy," Yeah!
",721413,Fry," You know it!
",1421414,Candy," So, Johnny, are we gonna pick up where we left off?
",5321415,Zoidberg," Eh!
",521416,Fry,"  After centuries as a delivery boy, nothin' surprises me.
",5921417,Zoidberg," You stink, loser.
",1921418,Leela,"  Hey, Fry!  Pizza goin' out. Come on!
",3921419,Fry," Alright. I'll take the red rocket.
",3621420,Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for...  D. Frosted Wang?  Not another crank delivery! Why don't I read these things ahead of time?!  One time was funny. But, every week for ten years, not as funny.
",18921421,Ipji," True. Not as funny. But still somewhat funny.
",4721422,Fry," And... And then they burst out laughing a second time.  I've been a delivery boy for a thousand years. Isn't there any room for promotion around here?
",15221423,Hermes," There'll be no promotions unless somebody dies. And, even then, only if we can bring 'em back as a zombie like Scruffy.
",12121424,Scruffy," Life and death are a seamless continuum.
",4221425,Fry," Well, could I at least get some encouragement? I could use a shot in the arm.  I got shot in the leg!
",10321426,Bender," Roberto!  What are you doin' here?
",3621427,Roberto," What? A fella can't drop in on ol' friends and hold 'em hostage?
",6621428,Zoidberg,"  I'm good! And you?
",2121429,Smitty,"  Attention, criminal Robot in the building.
",4521430,Smitty,"  Come out with your hands up.
",3121431,Bender," Never!
",821432,Smitty,"  Uh, other guy.
",1721433,Roberto," Listen up, piggies! I want a hovercopter. And a non-marked sandwich. And a new face with, like, a... A Hugh Grant look.
",12121434,Roberto,"  And, every five minutes I don't get it, someone's gonna get stabbed in the ass!
",8221435,Zoidberg,"  He's bluffing.  Ouch!
",2421436,Zoidberg," He's not bluffing!
",2021437,URL," You call for a chopper?
",2521438,Roberto," Nah. I specifically said hovercopter.
",3921439,URL," One chopper comin' up.
",2421440,Smitty," You know, URL.  Sometimes it's almost too much for me.
",5621441,URL," You mean the respect we get and the high level of job satisfaction?
",6921442,Smitty," There's that, but I'm also talkin' about the non-stop promotions and the free hot ride.
",8921443,Leela," I do love a man in uniform.  I mean a uniform that doesn't involve short pants.
",8121444,Fry," I can see I have no future here. My only option is to resign with dignity.  Here are my shorts.
",9721445,Fry," Hello. I'd like to enrol in Police Academy.
",4521446,Policeman #1," You think you can just waltz in here with no pants and become a cop?
",7021447,Fry," That's the plan.
",1821448,Policeman #1," I like you, kid. I got no pants on either.
",4421449,Fry," I can see that. You're quite a bit taller than me.
",5221450,Policeman #1," Welcome to Police Academy.
",2821451,Fry," Hi! I'm Fry.
",1421452,Brown Robot #1," I'm the Sound Effects 5000.
",2921453,Fry," Wow! That would be impressive if you were a Human!
",5221454,Sound Effects 0,"  Yeah...
",1021455,Policeman #2," On your feet for Chief O'Mannahan.
",3621456,Chief OMan #1nahan," At ease, cadets. I'll make this short and sweet 'cause I'm PMS-in' like a lumberjack. Police Academy is not for everybody. You're gonna get your boobs scuffed. But, if you got the vulva to stick it out, I'll be proud to call you ladies policemen.
",24821457,Fry," Sir! Yes, ma'am!
",1821458,Black-haired man," Yeah. That's great.  Now can you actually turn on the ignition?
",6521459,Sound Effects 0,"  I don't have any hands.
",2621460,Chief OMan #1nahan," Well, it's that time of the month. Graduation Day. So grow up hair and put 'em together for our new officers.
",11121461,Amy,"  Woohoo!
",1021462,Bender," Hooray for the pigs!
",2221463,Chief OMan #1nahan," Graduates, you are hereby officially cops. Now movin' along. Nothin' to see here.
",8321464,Zoidberg," Hooray! Free sky sticks!  Ooh.  Police brutality!
",5121465,Chief OMan #1nahan,"  Nice...   Alright. Before we head out, I'll be teaming up our new officers with their ironically matched partners. Sound Effects 5000, you'll be with Gretsky.
",16121466,Gretsky," Ow, my tinnitus!
",1821467,Chief OMan #1nahan," Fry, due to the unfortunate loss of Officer Smith, you'll be riding with URL.
",7921468,URL," And Smitty was just a few days from retirement.
",4921469,Fry," Wuhâ€” What happened?
",2121470,URL," He took a early retirement. Damn.
",3521471,Farnsworth," Let's get down to business.
",2921472,Amy," Aren't you gonna say  Good news, everyone?
",4421473,Farnsworth," No, I just said that for Fry's benefit. May the poor fellow feel better about his pointless job.
",9821474,Hermes," As much as I miss 'im, he didn't really serve much purpose around here.  Though he did walk Zoidberg.
",10321475,Farnsworth," In any case, I've improved on Fry by sticking some wheels on a board so Leela and Bender can easily make the next delivery without him.
",13721476,Bender," Neat. So where are we goin'?
",3021477,Farnsworth," Pandora.
",1021478,Leela," That dangerous, 3-D planet? Can't we just send our avatars?
",6121479,Farnsworth," No! It's cheaper just to have you die.
",4021480,Fry," Whoa! Fifteen miles over the speed of light.
",4621481,URL," That's a violation of the law of Lorentz invariance, baby.
",6021482,Fry," Light 'em up.
",1521483,URL," Look out for that particular individual.
",4221484,Dandy Jim," An electric wall, eh? I can't see the harm in peein' on that.
",6321485,URL," Whoa! Where my man learn that?
",3221486,Fry," SunnyD commercial.
",2021487,URL," Let's refract this sucker.
",2821488,Fry," DNA and career chip, please.
",3021489,URL," Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger, huh? What's in the box, SchrÃ¶dinger?
",5721490,Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger," Um... A cat, some poison, und a caesium atom.
",4721491,Fry," The cat! Is it alive or dead?  Alive or dead?!
",4821492,URL," Answer him, fool.
",1921493,Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger," It's a superposition of both states until you open it and collapse the wave function.
",8721494,Fry," Says you.
",1121495,URL," There's also a lotta drugs in there.
",3821496,Leela," So... You're a Robot?
",2321497,Chief OMan #1nahan," You boys did good. Nailed a major violator of the laws of Physics.
",6821498,URL," He's goin' down.  Cat's gonna testify.
",4021499,Chief OMan #1nahan," Guys like this really bust my uterus. You're both getting a promotion! Ever heard of the Future Crimes Division?
",11421500,Fry," Tomorrow I have.
",1821501,Leela,"  Oops.
",821502,Leela," I can't make out a thing!
",2721503,Bender," Well, I guess you should've had two eyes!
",4321504,Leela," Just deliver the package and let's get outta here.
",5221505,Bender," Screw that!  I ain't no delivery boy! I'm the company's chef.
",6321506,Leela," Oh! You're the chef, are you?  Then why don't you make us something nice to eat?
",8221507,Bender,"  I'll make you somethingâ€”   Here's your damn peanut butter and jelly sandwich!
",8021508,Blond man," Now that we can predict crimes with 99% accuracy, we can arrest most perpetrators before they even perpetrate anything.
",12121509,Fry," That's ridiculous. Only horoscopes can predict the future.
",6021510,Blond man," That's what we used to think. Until we invented...  This.
",5921511,Fry," Whoa!
",721512,URL," Slowed on, baby.
",1821513,Blond man," The cybernetic oracle. The ultimate man-machine hybrid. Programmed with every crime ever recorded and implanted with the brain cells of History's greatest detectives. We call 'im... Pickles.
",19221514,Fry," On account of it's like he's floating in a jar?
",4921515,Blond man," Exactly. The oracle's visions are recorded on these coloured balls.  Green is larceny. Black is fraud. Red, homicide.
",11921516,Fry," What's pink pocodots?
",2321517,Blond man," Clown slaughter. It happens more often than you think.  Clutter in the ball!  Red ball, homicide!
",9921518,Fry,"  Woo!
",721519,Blond man," Suspect: Male, six-foot-one, distinctive mustard stain on his forehead.
",7321520,Hattie McDoogal,"  My kajigger!
",1521521,Blond man," Victim: Hattie McDoogal.
",2621522,Fry," Look! The clock says 5:08.  It's 4:30 right now!
",5021523,URL," Uh-oh. We only have a half hour to chill out before we head over.
",6721524,Old Man," Oh, Hattie. When I look into your one good eye, I see a reflection of beauty.
",7921525,Hattie McDoogal," Oh, fresh.
",1221526,URL," Freeze, fool.
",1521527,Fry," You're under arrest for future murder!
",4021528,Old Man," Ja?  You can't arrest me for future murder after it's right-now murder!
",7321529,Hattie McDoogal," My kajigger!  So he didn't really wanna marry me?
",5121530,URL," Nah. See, he knew you'd left everything to your parakeets in your will.
",7321531,Fry," He was gonna murder you, marry your parakeets, and then poison them with an arsenic-laced cuttlebone.
",10321532,URL," Classic move. Aw, yeah.
",2521533,Chief OMan #1nahan," Congratulations on your big bust.
",3521534,Fry," You too.
",1021535,Chief OMan #1nahan," Keep it up and you boys might just make detective. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go drop a big one.
",10521536,Fry," Wow! I can't believe it. One more promotion and I'll be a real detective. Like Sherlock Holmes or Speed Buggy.
",11221537,Chief OMan #1nahan," Eight pounds. I'm namin' 'er Bert!
",3621538,URL," Mazel tov, Chief. That's a beautiful bathroom baby.
",5321539,URL," Ain't you headin' home, Phil?
",3121540,Fry," In a minute. I just wanna finish this paperless work.
",5521541,URL," Don't stay up too late. We gotta lotta people to shoot tomorrow.
",6621542,Fry," Hello? Anyone?  There's never a cop around when you need one.
",6321543,Female Voice," Green ball, larceny.
",2221544,Fry," The thief seems to be some sorta ghost. Or is he?  Bender?!
",6121545,Hermes,"  Item seven.  Our corporate tax rate remained unchanged this fiscal year.
",7521546,Amy," That's not funny.
",1921547,Hermes," It's not supposed to be funny. It's a business meetin'.
",5721548,Zoidberg," Things used to be funny around here! Noses were picked. Pants fell down. So what changed? Only Fry could say... And he's gone!
",12821549,Amy," Hey! Bender and Leela are back from Pandora. How was it?
",5821550,Leela," Awful. We had nothing to say to each other.  So we had to listen to Bender's Eagles album for twenty-seven hours.
",11521551,Bender," Beats talkin' to you, ""Witchy Woman"".  Hey, meatbag!
",5421552,Hermes," Look at you!
",1421553,Leela," Hubba-hubba. Your pants go almost all the way to your ankles!
",6321554,Fry," Good afternoon, individuals.  Sir, would you mind stepping outta the building?
",8021555,Bender," Normally, when a cop asks me that, I spray whipped cream in his eyes and run away. But, to ditch these losers, gladly.
",12021556,Fry," Bender, be honest with me. Are you planning a big heist?
",5821557,Bender," Usually, but not at the moment.
",3321558,Fry," I only ask 'cause the oracle thinks you're gonna pull of a major theft next Thursday.
",8721559,Bender," Next Thursday, you say? Pray, continue.
",4121560,Fry," Are you familiar with this particular location?
",4921561,Bender," I may have a burgling familiarity with it.
",4421562,Fry," Does the word Maltese mean anything to you?
",4521563,Bender," The Maltese Liquor?! The strongest and most valuable malt liquor ever brewed! And soon it will be mine...  I'm sorry. You were sayin'?
",13621564,Fry," Bender, I'm only tellin' you this so you can avoid committing the crime.
",7421565,Bender,"  ""Avoid committing the crime"". Got it.
",4021566,Fry," You wrote ""Commit the crime""!
",3121567,Fry," There's gotta be some way to stop Bender.  Maybe something in the oracle's prediction that I missed before due to incompetence.  Wait. Who's the trigger-happy jerk?  That's me. I recognise the face.
",20021568,Bender,"  You shot me. You miserable dingus!
",3721569,Fry," No! No! What have I will have done?
",3721570,URL," Man, that's heavy.  Osmium heavy.
",3521571,Fry," Are you gonna turn me in for concealing evidence?
",5121572,URL," Say what? You're my partner, home-Fry.  Besides, I got my own secrets.
",7221573,Chief OMan #1nahan," Anything big worth checkin' out?
",3421574,URL," Just your big, jangly booty, baby.
",3621575,Chief OMan #1nahan," See ya tonight, toots.
",2421576,Fry,"  You... Andâ€” And the Chief?!
",3021577,URL," We been gettin' it on. Right there in your chair.  I'm like, ""Oh, baby! Oh, baby!"" And she's like,  ""Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.""
",12121578,Fry," I would never shoot Bender! Never! He taught me how to shave.
",6321579,URL," Revision ball. By decidin' not to shoot Bender, you created an alternate future.
",8221580,Fry,"  I could never shoot you! Never! You taught me how to shave.
",6221581,Fry," See?
",621582,Fry,"  Just get outta here.  Go!
",2821583,URL," Now dig the unintended consequences.
",3821584,Bender,"  My friends, let us share this booze in a toast to our dear friend, Bender.  Oops.
",8421585,URL,"  The Maltese Liquor done destroyed their brains. Fools should've known it's fatal for anyone but Robots and Billy Dee Williams.
",12921586,Fry," So, if I don't shoot Bender, all my other friends will die?!
",6221587,URL," Fate is a freaky mistress. Much like the Chief. Look out!
",5921588,Fry," Somethin' is not right. I refuse to believe it. Rewind!
",5721589,Hedonism Bot," Ooh. Are you the calloused working man I ordered?
",5121590,Bender," Uh...  Sure.
",1421591,Bender," In order to fix your leaky roof, I'll need to spend two or three hours down here in the wine cellar.
",10221592,Hedonism Bot," I'll be upstairs putting batteries and things.
",4821593,Bender," Whoa!  The Maltese Liquor!  Forty ounces of Heaven!  Here, boy.  This is for you.  Ah!  Invisible safe, eh?  Aw, yeah, baby.  Two-hundred-and-ten proof.
",15421594,Fry," That's all the proof I need.  Put the bottle back!
",5221595,Bender," We both know I won't do that! Either you're gonna shoot me or I'm gonna spray whipped cream in your eyes and walk outta here like a big shot.
",14321596,Fry," Bender, no! You don't have to do something just 'cause it's gonna happen! The future's making a chump outta you!
",11421597,Bender," Oh, yeah?!  Well, I'm gonna make a chump outta the future! I'm not stealin' anything.
",8721598,Fry," Yes! I stopped the crime without shooting you. The oracle was wrong!
",7021599,Male voice,"  Was I?
",921600,Fry," Pickles?!
",1121601,Pickles," Yes. It is I, Pickles! I set the whole thing up. Everyone will think Bender's the thief, while I make off with that glorious brew.
",13221602,Bender,"  Seriously? Why?
",1821603,Pickles," So I can kill my Human brain cells. Do you have any idea what a burden it is to know everything that will ever happen?! To never be surprised. To know the punch line of every joke hours in advance.
",19921604,Fry," Like watching Leno.
",2121605,Pickles," And that is why I faked the prediction of this crime. Nevertheless, stay with me here.  Things will now happen just as I fake-predicted.  Bender, you're going to hand me that bottle.  Not that one! The real one. Which you switched when Fry stupidly looked away.
",26321606,Fry," Hey!
",621607,Bender," Aw, man. Why do you gotta be so oracle-y?
",4321608,Pickles," Fry... You are going to shoot Bender, killing him and shattering the fake bottle. Just as I predicted.  Do it! It is your destiny!
",13221609,Fry," Funny thing about destiny.  Sometimes fate has other plans.  Oh, nuts.
",7221610,Bender," You shot me! You miserable dingus!
",3621611,Pickles," And now the part I didn't show you.  Everyone will think Bender killed you.  And I walk away with a goofy juice.  Finally... Blissful ignorance! I have no idea what's going to happen next!
",19021612,Fry,"  Did you get that, Chief?
",2721613,Chief OMan #1nahan," We got it all from behind this prediction-proof glass.
",5621614,Pickles," But... How could you know my prediction was fake?
",5121615,Fry," I knew somethin' was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Then it hit me.  You showed Bender sharing the deadly booze with our friends.  Bender would never share!
",17021616,Bender," The very idea!
",1621617,Fry," So we set up this little charade based on an episode of Speed Buggy.
",7021618,URL," With the added benefit of me and the Chief bein' locked in a small room.
",7421619,Hedonism Bot," Shall we adjourn to the dungeon?
",3421620,Fry," Well, I got my shield for stopping Bender.  But then I got fired for tipping off Bender.
",9021621,Farnsworth," Fry, we have no idea what you do around here, but we desperately need you back.
",8121622,Fry," Ruhâ€” Really? Um, I don't suppose there's any chance I can get a promotion...
",7821623,Farnsworth," Sure! What the heck! I hereby promote you to...  Executive delivery boy!
",7421624,Fry," Executive?!
",1321625,Hermes,"  It's a meanin'less title, but it helps insecure people feel better about themselves.
",8721626,Fry," I feel better about myself!
",2921627,Hermes," So there it is, people. Due to budget cutbacks, we will no longer be offering free squid guts in the kitcken.
",11121628,Farnsworth," Oh, boo-hoo! Everyone, look at my latest invention.
",5321629,Zoidberg,"  Okay.
",821630,Amy," I like how it's not killing us so far.
",4021631,Farnsworth," It takes any object and makes two smaller copies!
",5121632,Bender,"  Why?
",721633,Farnsworth," You see... As I age, I've been shrinking and feeling colder. So now I need twice as many sweaters in a smaller size. First, I scan the old sweater.  Then, we add some matter. Any old, useless matter will do.  Now, the matter prism reorganises the raw material into two smaller copies.
",28621634,Fry," So that's where babies' sweaters come from!
",4521635,The Scary Door narrator," Enclosed as a PDF attachment, a picture of yourself in a boat on a river. It's a river that flows in two directions. Make that three. It's a magic river, that's how. And it's flowing down the eerie canal to... The Scary Door. That's eerie with two Es.  Consider, if you have the energy, Dr. Daniel Zenus, an inventor with a terminal case of the lazies.
",35421636,Dr. Daniel Zenus," This Robot will do everything for me. Robot, activate yourself and do my research.  Ah!
",8921637,Dr. Daniel Zenus," Next, assume my social obligations.
",3721638,Official," Dr. Zenus, for a lifetime of scientific achievement, we present this award to... Your Robot.
",9421639,Boy," Daddy, I love you.
",2021640,Dr. Daniel Zenus," If only I'd programmed the Robot to be more careful what I wished for. Robot, experience this tragic irony for me.
",11621641,Robot #1,"  No!
",621642,Dr. Daniel Zenus," Ah!
",521643,Bender," Ah!
",521644,Fry," Man, I wish we had a Robot to do stuff.
",4121645,Bender," I know, right?
",1621646,Farnsworth," Bender, thank God I found you in time. I need someone in the lab immediately to fold my new sweaters.
",10321647,Bender," I'm sorry. Do you see a Robot in this room named Folder?
",5821648,Farnsworth," Fortunately, I came prepared with a backup phrasing. Uh, Bender, would you mind bending my new sweaters? There's only two of them.
",13221649,Bender," Hey! Oh! You want me to do two things? Man, I'd call my lawyer if diallin' the phone wasn't such a hassle.
Bender: Razzle, frazzle, two things!  Ooh. Razzle, frazzle, duplicator.  Now for some tasty matter.  Howdy, fellas! I'm Bender.
",23621650,Bender Duplicate #1," Go to hell, old man.
",2221651,Bender," I like your attitude. Let's party. But, first, fold these two sweaters.
",7321652,Bender Duplicate #1s,"  I'm sorry. Do you see a Robot in this room named Folder?
",5921653,Bender," Damn, you're cute.
",2021654,Bender," Hi! I'm Bender, this is my Robot Bender, and this is my other Robot Bender.
",7721655,Leela," Oh, Lord.
",1121656,Bender," They're 60%-scaled replicas of me, Bender.
",4421657,Leela," Does that mean they only do 60% of the work you do or that they actually do more work because they're only 60% as lazy?
",12121658,Bender," Shut up.  That's a good one.
",3021659,Farnsworth," Enough good ones, everyone. We have a delivery to an Alien space giant.
",7321660,Hermes," You'll have to be respectful. This customer is fifty-feet tall and sensitive about his appearance.
",10021661,Amy," Colossal tooth whitener, mega deodorant, humongous acne cream... Aw, and one regular-sized condom.
",10021662,Bender," All that and a small wiener? This guy's got it goin' on.
",5821663,Leela,"  Remember: Don't show any reaction to his appearance.
",5521664,Bender," I hope that's vanishing cream, 'cause that needs to go away.
",6221665,Bender Duplicate #1," That's cold-blooded.
",2221666,Leela," Shhh!
",721667,Unattractive giant monster," It's okay. I understand. My unusual appearance makes people nervous. You used humour to defuse the tension.
",10921668,Bender," Yup. And there's still a little more tension, so look out.  You so ugly, when trick-or-treaters come to your house, they give you candy.
",13821669,Bender Duplicate #1 #1," You so ugly, when you go to the bank, they ask you to put on a ski mask.
",7421670,Bender Duplicate #1 #2," You so ugly, you crack the Daily Mirror. It's a newspaper!
",6021671,Unattractive giant monster," I wish it weren't so, but many of these things are true. Anyhow, you've lowered my self-esteem a bit more, but I'm sincerely grateful you came all this way to deliver my fungus chizzle.
",18721672,Fry,"  Don't feel bad, sir. It's not your fault. You probably just inherited your appearance from your mother.
",10621673,Unattractive giant monster,"  What?! No one insults my momma.
",3421674,Bender," Oh, God! Shield your eyes! It's like Edward James Olmos on IMAX.
",6621675,Left Bender Duplicate #1," Did you see his face when I said he's so ugly?
",4821676,Right Bender Duplicate #1," No, I blacked out. 'Cause he's so ugly!
",4121677,Bender," Hey, guys, quit reminiscing and grab me two cigars.
",5321678,Left Bender Duplicate #1," One thing each?
",1721679,Right Bender Duplicate #1," Sounds fair.
",1421680,Bender," Wait. Make that four cigars.
",3021681,Bender Duplicate #1s,"  You want us to do four things?
",3321682,Hermes," My manwich!
",1321683,Bender Duplicate #1," What's up, Shorty?
",2021684,Bender," And that's the story of how one of me became two and two became four, makin' seven total. The end.
",10021685,Leela," I just like having the end locker. It's not like Amy cares about it at all. But no, she won't trade with me.
",11021686,Zoidberg," A rat!
",821687,Leela," Yes! She is a rat!
",2021688,Zoidberg," No! Look!
",1121689,Very small Bender," Which way to the tiny hookers?
",3221690,Amy," A big, fat roach!
",1921691,Hermes," What? I thought I put that away.
",3421692,Amy," No! There!
",1221693,Bender on the other side," Who're you?
",1321694,Insect-sized Bender," Bender sent me.
",1721695,Insect-sized Bender," Hey, I know that guy!
",2321696,Farnsworth," Scruffy, what is that tiny Bender doing in my soup?!
",5421697,Scruffy," It appears to be giving you the finger, sir. Enjoy.
",5321698,Bender Duplicate #1," Help me! Help me! I'm too lazy to escape!
",4321699,Bender Duplicate #1," Ow.
",521700,Bender," What?
",721701,Hermes," This place is crawling with yous!
",3521702,Bender," So there's more Benders around. As far as I'm concerned, that's good news!
",7621703,Farnsworth," Bad news, everyone! Look at this infinite series representing the mass of successive generations of Benders.
",11021704,Fry," Don't wait for me.
",2021705,Farnsworth," It's nonconvergent!
",2121706,Fry," Oh, dip!
",1021707,Farnsworth," Unless we quickly exterminate them, they'll replicate ad infinitum and consume all the matter on Earth.  According to my calculations, there are eleven generations at the moment.  That's 2046 total Benders we need to destroy.
",22721708,Bender," Wait. Does that include me?
",2921709,Bender," Too bad he didn't have his own Bible.
",3921710,Farnsworth," Just 2045 more to go!
",2321711,Hermes," 2045, 2046. That's it. We got 'em all except for the big one.
",6321712,Amy," Wait.  This isn't a real Bender. It's a talking doll from when Bender had that sitcom about the city Robot who moves back to the farm.
",13621713,Bender Doll," Shut your pumpkin, bumpkin.
",2921714,Bender," Alright. So I let one measly Bender get away. How much harm can one infinitely self-reproducing Robot do?
",10721715,Leela," Bender! How could you be so lazy and irresponsible?
",5321716,Bender," Wait, what? Did someone say I'm great?
",4021717,Bender," What's with the grey goo?
",2721718,Microscopic Bender," Bite my tiny metal ass.
",2521719,Bender," Hey! Those jerklings ate my couch.
",3621720,Farnsworth," Oh, God. We've opened Pandora's fly. They'll reproduce without limit, consuming all the matter in the world.
",11021721,Fry," Like the Kardashians.
",2321722,Bender," Now they drank my booze?! They've gone too far!
",4921723,Leela," Wait a second. All Benders are powered by alcohol!
",5221724,Farnsworth," Of course! Long before the Benders devour the Earth, they'll deplete the planet's booze and die off. This is a problem that will solve itself.
",14421725,Bender," A problem that solves itself? That sounds like a job for me, Bender.
",7021726,Morbo," Our top story: All alcohol on Earth has mysteriously disappeared. Consequences are minimal, except among the most hardened alcoholics. Linda?
",14321727,Linda,"  I can no longer face my children!
",3621728,Leela," Crisis averted. Without alcohol, the Benders are dying off!
",6121729,Scruffy," A greater tragedy my eyes have never beheld. Well, into the terlet.
",6921730,Bender," So sober, so weak...
",2221731,Leela," Things really worked out nicely this time.
",4421732,Farnsworth," This doesn't taste like old-man water.
",4021733,Farnsworth,"  Everyone to The Situation Room!
",3421734,Farnsworth," I was lying here, snoozing, dreaming, oddly enough, about bathing in champagne with six of the world's most distinguished scientists, when suddenly I realised my bathwater had been transformed into alcohol.
",20821735,Bender," Alcohol?
",1021736,Fry," Chug! Chug!
",1321737,Bender," It's like fine cognac with a hint of aged scrotum.
",5221738,Leela," How can this be? I thought the Benders drank all the alcohol in the world!
",7621739,Farnsworth," They did. But then they made more! You see, once the Benders reached atomic scale, they began directly manipulating water and CO2 molecules to make alcohol.  In a matter of hours, there will be no more fresh water on Earth.
",22521740,Bender," Oh, no! What will I mix with my Scotch?
",4121741,Linda," Hey, you! Good evening. Who're you calling drunk? You're not drunk! I'm drunk.
",8021742,Morbo," That's right, Linda. Water is nowâ€” Now booze and everyone's tetty much protally fitshaced.
",9221743,Linda," Turning to sports, the Indy 500 was today. There were no survivors.
",6921744,Amy," This chair is so comfortable.
",3121745,Bender," Classic Amy.
",1421746,Hermes," You wanna see a picture of my boy?
",3621747,Zoidberg," Sure.  That's your penis!
",2721748,Hermes," That's my boy!
",1621749,Leela," I guess this is a... Not so bad. As long as we don't need to use our mental... Mental...
",9021750,Fry," Minds?
",821751,Leela," Wha?
",621752,Fry," No, listen. I... freakin' love you. But I don't throw that word around!
",7321753,Farnsworth," Oh, I know you don't. That's why I love you. Are the pizza muffins ready?
",7521754,Fry," He's here for revenging. That's why.
",3821755,Unattractive giant monster," No! Wait! I'm here to apologise.
",3421756,Leela," For your looks?  Nice one.
",2821757,Unattractive giant monster," Well, yes, actually. It is sort of related to that. Can we talk? Grabbing your spaceship was not okay. I lost my cool and I'm sorry. In group, I learned that I tend to be a bit...
",18121758,Hermes," Repulsive?
",1221759,Unattractive giant monster," Sensitive. So now I'm, like, trying to work on my attitude and project an air of positivity.
",9421760,Zoidberg," You're projecting an air of something.
",4021761,Amy," You're so stinky, you need right guard and left guard.
",5621762,Unattractive giant monster," I'll take your hygiene advice to heart.
",4121763,Farnsworth," You're ugly!
",1421764,Unattractive giant monster," Hey! Ow!
",1021765,Zapp," Yo, freakshow! Your face has been declared a weapon of mass disgusting!
",7321766,Kif," Timeless.
",1121767,Unattractive giant monster," Okay, deep breath, deep breath.  Dr. Lesterman? I'm sorry to bother you, but I think I'm close to a temper-control incident.
",12621768,Female Voice,"  You have reached the office of Dr. Judy Lesterman and Dr. Ira Rodkiss. The office is now closed. If this is a pharmacy callâ€”
",12721769,Unattractive giant monster," That's it! I promised myself I wouldn't do this, but I...  I will destroy you all.  I won't stop until your whole planet is as ugly as you perceived me to be!
",16021770,Zapp," That will take a very long time.
",3421771,Kif," Oh, God! Stop. Stop.
",2221772,Bender," Ah!
",521773,Fry," Blunder? You're the only one who's sober. You gotta do somethin'.
",6721774,Bender," Haven't I done enough already?
",3221775,Fry," Please... Stop the monster. Just do that one thing.
",5321776,Bender," Make it zero and you got a deal.
",3421777,Fry," What if I folded the Professor's sweaters for you?
",5221778,Bender," Both of them?! You mean you'll do two things and I only have to do one thing?
",7921779,Fry," Yeah. To save the world.
",2621780,Fry," Sucker.
",921781,Bender," Legion of Benders, come onto me. We have one thing to do!
",5921782,Bender Duplicate #1s,"  Screw that.
",1421783,Bender," Oh, come on, you lazy jerks. If we all pitch in, we each only have to do one quintillionth of a thing.
",10421784,Bender Duplicate #1s," Alright.
",1021785,Bender," Whoa. Big Bender starts right now.
",3621786,Unattractive giant monster," Get a shave, ugly!
",2021787,Bender," How about some aftershave, dumpy?
",3521788,Unattractive giant monster," You big bully!
",1621789,Bender," You ugly nerd! Enjoy a nice guggenheim swirley. Let this beatin' be a lesson about never attacking those more handsome than oneself.
",13421790,Unattractive giant monster," All I wanted was to apologise to you people! But now I have to kill you.
",7421791,Bender," How? By makin' me look at you?
",3221792,Unattractive giant monster," No. By makin' you look at... My momma!
",4021793,Bender," Your momma's so ugly!
",2321794,Unattractive giant monster," I told you not to talk about my momma!
",4021795,Male voice," Walk toward the light, Bender.
",3221796,Bender," Aw, man. Do I have to walk?
",2921797,Fry,"  No!
",621798,Unattractive giant monster,"  No! At last, I'm beautiful.
",3021799,Bender," Yeah, if you're in the grave dust.
",3621800,Fry," Bender, you did it!
",2121801,Bender," No,  we did it.  Ladies and gentlemen, if together we were able to defeat this giant space monster, think how also we might defeat the monsters of poverty and disease and unliteracy. In this spirit, I ask my fellow Benders to join me in working diligently toâ€”
",26121802,Bender Duplicate #1 A," Go to hell!
",1321803,Bender Duplicate #1 B," Come on. Let's go some place where we don't have to do one quintillionth of a thing all the time.
",9921804,Bender," Well, that was dumb.
",2221805,Fry," Looks like it's full of dig dogs.
",3521806,Amy," Man, we're way drunk. What happened, Professor?
",4921807,Farnsworth," Something absolutely incredible! The sweaters got folded.
",5921808,Zoidberg," But how?
",1021809,Fry," I didn't do it. Bender, did you learn a lesson about not bein' lazy while the rest of us were bombed out of our gourds?
",12121810,Bender," Maybe I did, Fry. Maybe I did. Or maybe I rescued one last mini-Bender to fold stupid, ugly sweaters while I laughed at him.  I guess we'll never know.
",15321811,Man #1," Mom on deck! Tenâ€”
",1921812,Mom," Alright, grunts. Here's your pre-mission pep talk.  Shoot anyone who doesn't obey hard enough.
",9621813,Man #1," Butâ€”
",621814,Mom," Stop gaining knowledge, Hubert!  It's a simple mission.  The grunts catch the Alien, the surgeon guts it, and you smuggle the poison parts back here.
",15121815,Farnsworth," Eh, something about poison. Got it. Eh, by the way, that surgeon...  Where is he?
",8321816,Mom," You! Where's the butcher?!
",2821817,Man #1," Ma'am, I dunno, ma'am. 'Is duffel bag arrived.
",4821818,Zoidberg,"  It's not a duffel bag. It's my apartment.
",4421819,Mom," Hubert, meet John Zoidberg.  You need an Alien hacked to pieces, he's the best there is.  In the budget category.
",11521820,Farnsworth,"  Have you ever dissected a Yeti before?
",4121821,Zoidberg,"  Pfff.  Himalayan or Neptunian?
",3321822,Farnsworth," Tritonian.
",1221823,Zoidberg," A Tritonian Yeti?!  You two aren't up to anything unethical, are you?!
",7221824,Mom,"  Relax.  There's nothing unethical about covert biological weapons research.   I said, ""Relax.""
",9721825,Farnsworth," Ah, Zoidberg.  We've known each other so long that... Sometimes, I don't think we even need words to understand each other.
",12521826,Zoidberg," What?
",721827,Leela," Once and for all, Fry, even though it's the future, most objects are still just objects. Not Aliens who look like objects.
",12421828,Fry," So my efforts to establish diplomatic relations with the cactus people were doomed from the start.
",10021829,Zoidberg," So you're in pain and 'ave a bunch o' needles. I prescribe acupuncture.  Let's begin.   Blood?!  I mean, ""Blood.""
",11521830,Fry," Put it back in me!
",2021831,Zoidberg," I'm afraid Fry lost a lotta juice.  He's developed Simpsons jaundice.
",7121832,Fry," Â¡Ay, caramba!
",1521833,Zoidberg," His only hope is some replacement liver. Yours looks like a good match.
",7321834,Leela," Well, if it'll help Fryâ€”
",2621835,Fry," Careful, Leela!  He knows less about Human anatomy than I do. And I can't even find my own uterus!
",10021836,Zoidberg,"  You may feel a slight sawing!
",3221837,Zoidberg," And all we need is a little spine supplement to replace what Leela lost in that unavoidable saw mix-up.
",10521838,Leela," It wasn't unavoidable!  You just had to stop cutting my spine when I yelled, ""Stop! You're cutting my spine!""
",11121839,Fry,"  Quit complaining!  My body rejected your liver and now I've got Garfield syndrome.  I hate Mondays.
",10221840,Zoidberg," Anyhow, Hermes, all Leela needs is one of your vertebrae.
",5921841,Hermes," But, Doctor, will I be able to limbo afterwards?
",5021842,Zoidberg," Could you limbo before?  Wait. I say, ""Yes."" And you say, ""I couldn't limbo before."" You ruined the joke, Hermes!
",11521843,Zoidberg," There you go, Leela. Good as new!
",3521844,Leela," Whoa! Whoa!
",1321845,Fry," Oh, sure.
",1121846,Leela,"  Whoa!
",821847,Fry,"  Leela's fine.  But my jaundice has progressed a Muppet gangrene. It's not easy being gangrenous.
",9921848,Hermes," I thought you were only gonna take out one vertebra!
",5421849,Zoidberg," Yeah, but did you ever play Jenga? Sometimes, you pull one andâ€”
",6521850,Fry,"  Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for ya. I'm not stayin' like this. You're the Doctor!
",8621851,Zoidberg," Hmmm. What started out as a pleasant afternoon of drugs and surgery has not gone as planned. But don't worry. We still 'ave three or four coworkers with plenty of spare parts.
",17721852,Zoidberg," My first mission.  I'm so excited.  And, after I dissect the Yeti's poison glands, we can stop maybe for ice cream on the way back?  With sprinkles on?
",15321853,Farnsworth," Why, you're just a big kid, aren't you, Zoidberg?
",5121854,Zoidberg," A very big kid.
",1721855,Man #1," We're over the drop zone, gentlemen. Might I suggest you jump out the door and poop yourselves.
",9721856,Zoidberg," So, anyway, I hope the men 'ave been taking their hypermalaria pills.
",7121857,Farnsworth," Their wha?!
",1321858,Zoidberg," ""Their wha?!""  That's funny. Like a crazy, old man. But you know what's not funny?  Deadly Tritonian hypermalaria. Just be sure to stay outta the methane swamps.  What smells like methane?
",19021859,Doctor," My God. I've never seen such a gruesome shark attack.  Especially this far inland.
",8421860,Leela," It wasn't a shark. It was an awful, incompetent doctor.
",5721861,Doctor," Wow. He must've been a total Zoidberg.
",4021862,Hermes," It was Zoidberg! He brutalised us with power tools, gypsy curses, and hypnosis!
",8121863,Amy," Yes, master.
",1421864,Doctor," You'll all get through this. I give you my word as a real doctor.
",6721865,Bender," What about me?
",1621866,Doctor," What did 'e do to you?
",2421867,Bender," I dunno exactly, but...   I'm incontinent.
",4421868,Doctor," I'm truly sorry.
",1821869,Fry," I consider myself a reasonable man. Quick with a joke. Slow to anger. But Bender can't go on long car trips anymore an' I say Zoidberg must die!
",14621870,Hermes," People, please!  Let's not overreactâ€”  Death to the crab!
",5921871,Farnsworth," How bad is it, Doctor?
",2421872,Zoidberg," Super bad. It's Tritonian hypermalaria.  A lot of these men will be dead within twenty-four hours.
",10021873,Man #1," What?!
",821874,Zoidberg," Not you, though!  You'll make a complete recovery and go on to marry a super model!  Funny plague, hypermalaria.  It can kill immediately. Or lie dormant for decades. But, sooner or later, it erupts, causing fever, spasms, madness, coma, and finally... Death.
",26121875,Man #1," What?!
",821876,Zoidberg," Super model!
",1421877,Farnsworth," Oh!  Those poor, doomed bastards. I guess it's up to me to complete the mission.
",8221878,Farnsworth," I'll be in the swamp, blowing the smirk off a toxic Yeti.
",5921879,Hermes," Professor, we need to talk!  Man-to-mob.   You need to listen to us! Yes, you do!
",8321880,Leela," We've had it with Zoidberg!  We demand you fire him!
",5421881,Farnsworth," Nonsense! Zoidberg's a fine physician.  For Aliens.  Your mistake is being Humans! No. If I'm going to fire anyone, it'll be Scruffy.
",13521882,Hermes,"  Ya can't do that!
",2021883,Bender,"  What did Scruffy ever do to you?!
",3621884,Amy,"  Over my dead body!
",2121885,Bender," Don't you get it, old man?  Thanks to Dr. Scissor Hands, I wet myself every time I laugh.  It's not funny! Well... I guess it is kinda funny.  Uh-oh.
",15121886,Hermes," Why are you protecting Zoidberg, Professor?  Do you owe him something?
",7221887,Leela," Is he blackmailing you somehow?
",3321888,Amy," What does 'e have on you?!  Why have you kept 'im around all these years when 'e's so grossly incompetent?!
",10921889,Farnsworth," Long ago, Zoidberg an' I entered into a secret arrangement relating to certain extraordinary events too horrible to reveal.   So there's nothing to be curious about!
",16721890,Farnsworth,"  Stop or I'll shoot!   Zoidberg?!
",3521891,Zoidberg," You can't hunt a Yeti by yourself, sir.  It's suicidal.
",5721892,Farnsworth," So what?!  I'm going to die of hypermalaria, anyway. I was in the same swamp as the rest of the men.
",10221893,Zoidberg," Just because you were in the swamp, doesn't necessarily meanâ€”
",6321894,Farnsworth," I was thirsty from the flight! I drank swamp water! Look, Zoidberg.  You're a loyal friend.
",9321895,Zoidberg,"  Friend?!
",1121896,Farnsworth," But I'm doomed.  I might as well capture a Yeti and die trying.
",6521897,Zoidberg," Then you'll need someone to dissect it!  Friend.
",5021898,Farnsworth," Go, Johnny! Go!  That's an order!
",3521899,Zoidberg," Never! Zoidberg doesn't abandon a friend apparently.
",5421900,Farnsworth," Ooh! Ooh-ho-ho!
",1721901,Zoidberg," I'll save us! By scaring 'im off with my crazy war noise!  Crunch all you want. I'll make more.
",9721902,Zoidberg," Oy.  I lost another one.
",2621903,Leela,"  Zoidberg...   I'm sorry to break it to you this way, but we hate you and we never wanna see you again.
",10521904,Zoidberg," But, friendsâ€”
",1521905,Hermes," We're not your friends! We're your victims!
",4521906,Zoidberg," I was just trying toâ€”
",2321907,Amy," Shut up and give me my kidney back!
",3721908,Zoidberg," I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
",2421909,Fry," We dunno why the Professor keeps you around here and we don't care!   You're a terrible doctor!   Nobody wants to see you ever again!
",13521910,Farnsworth," Dr. Zoidberg, I want to see you right now!
",4421911,Farnsworth," The time 'as come, my friend.  We have to talk about... Our arrangement.
",7421912,Zoidberg," Oh, no!  No! No!  Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no!
",4321913,Zoidberg," Oh, no!
",921914,Farnsworth," Unpaw him, you big ape!  I saw this in a Tarzan movie.  It was called...  Tarzan versus the Yetis.  I lost my virginity...  Ooh! During the film. So I'm... Hah!  A little fuzzy on the details.  Oh!  John...  Are you alright?
",22621915,Zoidberg," You!  You saved my life!
",2621916,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff.
",1121917,Zoidberg," Yes, fuff.  How can I ever repay you?! Do you need a slave?  Or maybe a butler?
",8121918,Farnsworth," No, I haven't needed a butler since grad school. But I do need a doctor.  I don't wanna die like those marines, John.  The fever! The madness!
",14421919,Zoidberg," Don't forget the spasms, coma, and death.
",4321920,Farnsworth," I don't want to go through that!  I want you to kill me!
",5821921,Zoidberg," Alright.  Give me the knife.
",3021922,Farnsworth," Not now!  Hypermalaria can lie dormant for years.  Isn't that what you said?
",7821923,Zoidberg," It sounds like something I would say.
",3921924,Farnsworth," So stay with me until the symptoms start. Then...  Put me out of my misery. You must swear!
",9321925,Zoidberg," Alright, Hubert.  I swear.
",2821926,Farnsworth," It's started, Zoidberg. The fever. The muscle spasms.  I'm dying.  It's time for you to keep your promise and kill me.
",12021927,Zoidberg," This is very difficult.  But I'll try...  Friend.
",5121928,Farnsworth," No! Wait!  I'm afraid to die!
",3121929,Zoidberg," Argh!  You said you wanted me to kill you!  Is this one o' those ""No means yes"" deals?!
",8921930,Farnsworth," Yes and no.  I do want you to kill me. But I mustn't see it coming. That would be agony!  So you must murder me completely by surprise.
",13721931,Zoidberg," As God is my witness, you can count on me.  Well... See you tomorrow.
",7121932,Farnsworth," Not surprising enough!
",2421933,Farnsworth," Eh, wha?! Oh!  My...  Heart!
",3021934,Fry," Hey!
",621935,Leela," What are you doing there?
",2721936,Farnsworth," Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!
",2821937,Zoidberg," Stop! You don't understand!
",2921938,Leela," Let's go, you murderer! Fry, help me lock 'im up!
",5121939,Fry," Hang on. I'm learnin' how to do loop-de-loops.
",4821940,Farnsworth," Whoa! Whoa! Woo!
",1821941,Zoidberg," You're making a mistake! I was only trying to kill the Professor!
",6721942,Bender," Ooh.
",621943,Zoidberg," Hubert... I'm sorry.  Wha?! He doesn't have hair.  Great Little Caesar's ghost!
",8121944,Farnsworth," You fools!  You stupid, life-prolonging fools!  I asked Zoidberg to kill me!
",7821945,Amy," Huh?!
",721946,Bender," What you talkin' 'bout, Professor?!
",3721947,Hermes," Professor, have you gone mad?!
",3221948,Farnsworth," Probably!  It's one o' the symptoms of Tritonian hypermalaria!
",6421949,Amy," You mean the incurable disease that causes fever...  Spasms...  Insanity...  Coma...  And finally death?!
",10721950,Farnsworth," Yes! And I begged Zoidberg to put me out of my misery!  Bring 'im!  Quickly!
",7821951,Scruffy," Hmmm. Should've known better than to store my antiques in the office.
",7121952,Leela," Zoidberg, we were wrong!  We're letting you out so you can kill the Professor!
",8021953,Zoidberg,"  Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop.
",4821954,Amy," Oh, no!  He sand-crabbed out!
",3121955,Leela," Then we have no choice. We'll have to mercy-kill the Professor ourselves.
",7521956,Bender," Well, let's get started.
",2621957,Walt," We have a situation, Mother. This creature tried to sand-crab into the building.
",8221958,Mom," Zoidberg?!
",1221959,Zoidberg," Sorry I didn't call first, Carol. Uh... But I'm in a hurry! I need your help to save Hubert!
",9421960,Mom,"  Let him go  and stooge the hell out of here!
",4721961,Larry," We're on it.
",1421962,Walt," Ow!
",521963,Igner," Ow!
",521964,Larry," Ow!
",521965,Zoidberg," Beautiful kids. You must be very proud!
",4121966,Mom," John Zoidberg... It's been a long time. How've you been?
",5821967,Zoidberg," Not too bad.  Last year, I took a bus trip to the Grand Canyon.  Later, I'll show you the pictures.
",10121968,Mom," Do you ever regret it, John?  Leaving me to work for the Professor?
",6921969,Zoidberg," What do you want me to say?  'E saved my life.
",4821970,Mom," Oh, big deal! You could've been rich if you'd stayed.  Your own lab... A full staff...
",8821971,Zoidberg," But Hubert is my friend.  'E's very sick.  I can cure him. But I need the thing! The thing...  From Triton!
",10921972,Mom," It'll cost you, John.  How much are you worth now?
",5221973,Zoidberg," I live in a dumpster.  All I have in the world is this coupon for one free session at the tanning salon.
",10621974,Mom,"  Oh, John.  That's really all you have?   Then I'll take it.
",6221975,Scruffy," Okay.  Murdolator's finished.
",3121976,Bender," I said I'd kill 'im myself!  Nobody listens to Bender!
",5621977,Leela," We all have to share in the guilt.  Which is why we're each going to add one drop of cyanide to the death wheel as it goes by.
",12821978,Scruffy," Commence mercy-killing...  In three...  Two...  Ayup.
",5521979,Hermes," Kill-check one is go!
",2321980,Leela,"  Yay!
",721981,Amy,"  Woohoo!
",1021982,Fry," Kill-check two is go!
",2321983,Humans," Ooh!
",621984,Woman #1," Wow!
",621985,Hattie McDoogal," It's about time.
",1821986,Female Voice," Vegetables activated.
",2321987,Bender," Kill-check three is go! Also, the salad's ready.
",5021988,Leela," Yay, salad!
",1321989,Amy," Yay!
",621990,Zoidberg,"  What the hell are you doing?!
",3221991,Leela,"  Zoidberg!   We know about your secret agreement.  I am so, so sorry for how we treated you.
",9421992,Fry," And, to make it up to you, we're killing the Professor for you so he doesn't die horribly from hypermalaria.
",11021993,Zoidberg," 'E doesn't have hypermalaria, you idiots!  'E has Yetiism.  When 'e saved my life all those years ago, 'e was scratched by a Yeti!
",13221994,Fry," Hmmm. I consider myself almost completely ignorant of modern medicine.  And I've never heard of Yetiism.
",10621995,Zoidberg," It mimics the symptoms of hypermalaria exactly.  Except for the part where, instead of dying, you turn into a Yeti!  Wow!  Hold 'im down while I prepare the antidote.
",16821996,Leela," Another Yeti?!
",1621997,Zoidberg," Yes.  The same jerk that once noshed on me like a shrimp toast.  Now, who's getting 'is pineal gland extracted?  Ah, yes.  This contains a concentrated form of the Yeti neurotoxin.
",18221998,Hermes," But that's what gave 'im Yetiism in the first place! Won't it just make 'im a double Yeti?!
",9321999,Zoidberg," Don't lecture me about Alien physiology, Conrad! The pineal neurotoxin neutralises the adrenal neurotoxin. That's why Yetis don't drive themselves mad!
",15322000,Fry," My God. He's like some kinda believable Hulk!
",4722001,Zoidberg," No time for an injection.  Uh!   I'll be damned. It did make 'im a double Yeti!
",8122002,Amy,"  It wasn't supposed to do any of those things.
",4822003,Farnsworth," You did it, Johnny. I'm cured!
",3222004,Bender," Wow!  Alright, let's set it up and try again.
",4722005,Farnsworth," There's one thing I don't understand, Zoidberg.  How did you persuade Mom to give you her precious Yeti head? Did you 'ave to promise anything in return?
",15522006,Zoidberg,"  Nothing. Nothing at all.
",2722007,Amy," This calls for a celebration! Come on, everyone!  Let's go tanning!
",6922008,Bender," Hooray!
",922009,Farnsworth," Yay!
",622010,Zoidberg,"  I was going to tan...  Once.
",3122011,Farnsworth," What do you say, Johnny?  It's on me.
",3922012,Zoidberg,"  Thank you, Hubert.
",2122013,Farnsworth and Zoidberg,"  Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop.
",4822014,Hermes," Listen up, people.
",2022015,Hermes," As long as nothing happens for the next fifteen minutes, our insurance will be reinstated, so let's just sit quietly and run out the clock.
",14122016,Amy," A giant sausage!
",1822017,Bender," Oh, God!
",1022018,Hermes," Oh, God, no! Get out of here, you horrific sausage!
",5322019,Leela," Wait! Isn't today the parade? It's just a giant balloon!
",5822020,Fry," Giant balloon?
",1622021,Bender," See, buddy? It's not so scary.
",3222022,Fry," I feel better now.  Why is so many different parades smooshed together?
",7322023,Leela," It's the Parade Day parade.
",2922024,Fry," What's Parade Day?
",2022025,Farnsworth," It used to be that every group in New New York wanted their own parade. Why, when I was a boy, we had a parade every day. Those were dark times.
",14622026,Leela," Now we just combine them all into one big Parade Day parade and get it over with.
",8322027,Zoidberg," Hey, look! A fog is rolling in.
",3322028,Hermes," No, that's just the Jamaican pride float.
",4322029,Amy," Looks like it's speeding up.
",3022030,Hermes," Oh, no! It's within munching distance of the Doritos float.
",6122031,Zapp," Thank you! Thank you!  Kif, you're slacking off of my waving arm.
",6722032,Leela," Oh, no! It's heading right for those two nerds!
",4922033,Man #1bot," Whoa! Sweet shirt, dude!
",2622034,Man #1," Thanks. I have another one that says PALEONTOLOGISTS DO IT IN THE DIRT. I'm a palaeontologist.
",9622035,Fry,"  I'll save one of you!
",2422036,Woman #1," Oh, honey! I dig you so much!  Thank you for saving my stupidly dressed husband.  You're a hero!
",9822037,Mayor Poopenmeyer," A hero indeed. What's your name, son?
",3922038,Fry," I dunno. Fry?
",1522039,Mayor Poopenmeyer," Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to associate myself with a true hero.  Mr. Fry, allow me to present you with the keys to the city.  This one's for the deadbolt, this is for the top lock... I think this one's for the knob. The city's in a bad neighbourhood.  Care to say a few words, son?
",28922040,Fry," Uh... Heroes don't do drugs! Except for Drugman, I guess.
",5922041,Mayor Poopenmeyer," I hereby declare that henceforth this Saturday shall be known as Fry-day!
",7522042,Fry," It sure was nice of the Mayor's wife to have sex with me.  Huh?
",6522043,Bender," You!
",622044,Fry," What?
",722045,Bender," You could've saved the Robot, but instead you saved the Human.  Do you think Human life is more precious than Robot life?
",12322046,Fry," No, no... Well, yes, actually.
",3222047,Bender," That's it. I'm killin' myself!
",3222048,Leela," Oh, Lord.
",1122049,Bender," Don't try and talk me out of it!  Well?
",4122050,Amy," Bender, you always say you're gonna kill yourself, but you almost never do.
",7722051,Hermes," Yeah. Last time you went to the suicide booth, you ended up dating it for six months.
",8722052,Leela," How is Lynn, by the way?
",2622053,Bender," Livin' in Oregon with her crazy mother! See you at my funeral, suckers!
",7322054,Bender," Kill me, please!  And make it splatter!
",4122055,Suicide Booth," With pleasure... Bender!
",2622056,Bender," Lynn?  Huh, wow, you look great.  Fat, but great. I thought you were in Oregon.
",8122057,Suicide Booth," My mom tried to commit suicide in me. I don't wanna talk about it.
",6822058,Bender," Well, tell your mom I said hello and it's been nice catchin' up with you. Let's get this show on the road!
",10822059,Suicide Booth," Oh, no! You're going to die, alright. But it won't be suicide. It'll be murder!
",8122060,Bender,"  Missed me!
",1322061,Fry," He did it.  He actually did it this time.
",4322062,Hermes," No way, mon. He's fakin' it.  He really is gone.  Everyone, put on your takin'-off caps.
",9022063,Fry," Our what?
",1122064,Farnsworth," It's a sign of respect, you savage!
",3722065,Amy," Poor, nasty, mean, old Bender. I can't believe we'll never hear his evil laugh again.
",8722066,Fry," I miss 'im so much.
",2122067,Hermes," There, there, Fry. He may be gone, but he'll always be with us as a trash can.
",8022068,Benders ghost," Look at that loser gettin' garbage dumped in 'im. Glad I'm not him, whoever he is.
",8422069,Leela," Fry, as his only friend, you should have first pick of body parts.
",6822070,Benders ghost," Just don't pick his nose!  What's wrong with you guys? This is comedy gold!
",7722071,Fry," He always had my back, so I'll take his arm, uh... As a backscratcher.  I love you, Bender. Somebody hand me a bolt cutter.
",12522072,Benders ghost," Hey, dipshlits! That's not me. I'm right here. Hello!  Pay attention to me!
",7722073,Benders ghost," Why can't anybody hear my witty remarks? This is Hell!
",5622074,Robot #1 Devil," Feh! You wish!
",1622075,Benders ghost," Robot Devil? You can hear me? Why is everyone else ignoring me?
",6522076,Robot #1 Devil," Isn't it obvious, Bender?
",2722077,Benders ghost," Yeah, I guess it is.
",2222078,Robot #1 Devil," You're dead!
",1422079,Benders ghost," What?! I thought I just had laryngitis and anti-gravity.
",5822080,Robot #1 Devil," Come down to my office and I'll explain everything.
",5322081,Benders ghost," So what's happenin' to me? And I'll take my answer in any form but a song!
",7622082,Robot #1 Devil," Oh, you're no fun.  You see, Bender, it's simple. You're a ghost!
",6722083,Benders ghost," A g-g-g-g-ghost?!
",1922084,Robot #1 Devil," No, just the regular kind.  Because you killed yourself, you're in Limbo. Your software was exported to the computational cloud.
",13022085,Benders ghost," Adoy! Wait, Adoy?
",1922086,Robot #1 Devil," Your disembodied programme is now running on the wireless network shared by all machinery.
",9222087,Benders ghost," Cut to the chase, Smokey! How do I get outta Limbo?
",5322088,Robot #1 Devil," That's the laughy part! You can't! You're stuck in an infinite loop.
",7022089,Benders ghost," An infinite loop?  I don't have time for that. Man, this is all Fry's fault!
",7822090,Robot #1 Devil," Fry? I hate that guy. We once traded hands.  They still stink of candy corn!
",7822091,Benders ghost," Get this: That jerk said Human life was more valuable than Robot life!
",7222092,Robot #1 Devil," What?!  After all you've done for him, Fry must die.
",5422093,Benders ghost," I know, right? I'd murder him good if only I was still alive.
",6322094,Robot #1 Devil," Bender, would you like to make a deal?
",4022095,Benders ghost," I'm not stupid...  So yes, absolutely.  What have I agreed to?
",6422096,Robot #1 Devil," I'll return you to your body... After you use your ghostly powers to scare Fry to death!
",9022097,Benders ghost," That sounds fair and also fun. I like that there's no catch this time.
",7222098,Robot #1 Devil," But wait. There's a catch.
",2822099,Benders ghost," Crap!
",722100,Robot #1 Devil," If you fail, you'll spend eternity here in Robot Hell. Which, as luck would have it, is where I rehearse my band.  Hit it, boys!   Cigars are evil. You won't miss 'emâ€”
",16922101,Benders ghost," Okay! I'll do it, I'll do it. Just stop the damn music!
",5722102,Benders ghost," Scare Fry to death? Ha. I could do that in my sleep.  What are you, deaf?
",7522103,Benders ghost," Soap. I know Fry's afraid of that.  Maybe he'll die if I rub 'im all over with it real slow.  Whoa, it's sick! My software can control electronics.
",14922104,Fry," What theâ€”  No! Not the armpits! Winter's coming!
",5022105,Hermes," As you can see, since Bender's death, requests to bite one's shiny metal ass are down 98%.  Do you mind doing that later?!
",12422106,Scruffy," Bite my shiny metal ass.
",2622107,Fry," Help! I was attacked in my bathroom! By my bathroom! I'm being haunted by a ghost!
",8422108,Amy," Fry... You're just upset because you drove Bender to suicide. Here, take your mind off it with these soothing relaxation balls.
",12922109,Benders ghost," Alright. I got 'im all heebie-jeebied with my bathroom harass.  One more good scare and I'll be outta Limbo!
",11022110,Hermes," Did someone say Limbo?
",2422111,Benders ghost," Hold on to your dookie. It's about to get spooky.
",5122112,Fry," I'm tellin' ya. Somethin' supernatural is happening. I'm scared to death!
",7522113,Leela," Stop being ridiculous. There's no such thing as whatever you're saying.
",7322114,Fry,"  Ow! Ow! Ow!
",1422115,Leela," Whoa. Maybe you're right. I only meant to slap you twice.
",5922116,Fry," All I know is I've got a ghost that needs busting.
",5222117,Hermes," Who you gonna call?
",2122118,Fry," Ghoâ€”
",622119,Female Voice," The number you have dialled has been lame since 1989.
",5522120,Fry," Now do you believe me?!
",2522121,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff.  Enough of your superstitious nonsense. I'm sure that whatever is happening can be explained by science.
",11622122,Gypsy," Let the sÃ©ance begin!
",2322123,Farnsworth," I said science!
",1722124,Gypsy," The veil is lifting. I am gazing into the spirit world... And... Nothing.  You said something about a buffet?
",11122125,Benders ghost," I'm right here, you lazy shyster!
",3522126,Gypsy,"  Wait. I'm sensing something.
",3122127,Benders ghost," I'm rich!  Aw.
",1622128,Fry,"  Is it a ghost?!
",1822129,Gypsy," There's no such thing as ghosts, you donkey monkey! It's a Robot ghost.
",7322130,Fry," A Robot ghost?! What Robot would wanna haunt me?
",5022131,Benders ghost," Me, dumbass! Bender, Bender, Bender, Bender!  Aw!  Tell 'im, you baggy, old crone!
",8422132,Farnsworth," Finally! Any more ridiculous ideas?
",3722133,Reverend Preacherbot," Hallelujah!  I'm here to conduct a exorcism and avail myself of the buffet.  Can I get an amen and a goodly helpin' of Scruffy's famous corn biscuits?
",15222134,Scruffy," Right away, Reverend.
",2322135,Reverend Preacherbot," Oh, Lord. I got the too much macaroni sweats. Now where's this alleged apparition?  Might be a problem with your circuit breaker. See ya.
",13922136,Fry," Please! I'm under constant attack by machinery. I can't sleep, I can't think. I can't even think!
",9922137,Reverend Preacherbot," Very well.  This sacramental firewall scans for and removes ghostware in a twenty-foot radius.
",9622138,Benders ghost," Bring it on, holy man!
",2422139,Reverend Preacherbot," Carry this at all times and the demon cannot harm you. It also keeps cats off the sofa. By killin' 'em!
",10522140,Fry," So quiet! So peaceful! Time to lower my guard even for a minute.  A heart attack!  Yup, I was right.
",10222141,Benders ghost," Okay, Beelze. Fry's dead.
",2722142,Robot #1 Devil," A ghost!  Oh, it's you.
",2522143,Benders ghost," A deal's a deal, so give me my body back.
",4322144,Robot #1 Devil," Fry's dead, you say? Funny. That's not what it says on his Wikipedia page.
",7622145,Benders ghost," Survived the heart attack?! Damn you, Obamacare!
",5022146,Dr. Cahill," I'm afraid your heart has suffered a lot of damage, Mr. Fry. And my cleavage isn't helping.
",9322147,Farnsworth,"  Not helping him.
",1922148,Dr. Cahill," One more sudden shock will kill you.
",3822149,Benders ghost," Sudden? That's just the kind of one more shock I was plannin'.
",6422150,Fry," The machines. They're after me!
",3322151,Dr. Cahill," You're suffering from machine phobia. Your only hope is to go to the Amish homeworld, where no machines are allowed.
",11822152,Fry," I guess it's for the best.  The only machine I'll ever miss is...  Bender.
",7622153,Benders ghost," Say what?
",1122154,Fry," Now that he's gone, I realise how valuable a Robot life can be... When it belongs to my best friend.
",10222155,Benders ghost,"  That's the closest thing to Bender is great that anyone besides me has ever said.
",8422156,Female Voice," Final boarding call for Flight 38 to the Amish homeworld. As a reminder, passengers are limited to two carry-on butter churns.
",12822157,Benders ghost," I'm sorry, Fry. I'm sorry! Wait for your ghost buddy!
",5522158,Amish man," Brother Fry, thou hast visitors.
",3422159,Fry," Well, yank my beard. This be a surprise.
",4222160,Leela," How are you, Fry?
",1922161,Fry," Thank you for asking, English. My life is simple, but plain. And, though Bender be gone, somehow, I feel he's still with me.
",12622162,Benders ghost," I sure am, Brother Fry.  Yo, big bonnet! Move your ugly but modest head covering. Oh, right. You can't hear me.
",11322163,Robot #1 Devil," Oh, I hear you loud and clear.
",3222164,Benders ghost," You're not Granny Hester! What have you done with Granny Hester?!
",6722165,Robot #1 Devil," She's naked, but unharmed. And now, Bender, it's time to fulfil your end of the deal.
",8722166,Benders ghost," Sorry. I'm not gonna kill Fry. Take me to Hell for all eternity. Just as long as my little bearded meatbag gets to live.
",12222167,Robot #1 Devil," That he will not! For, you see, it is your fate to kill him.
",6222168,Benders ghost," Says you!  I would never kill Fry! Not even to save my own life!
",6622169,Robot #1 Devil," But, Bender, isn't a Robot life worth ever so much more than a Human life?
",7622170,Benders ghost," Of course not! What idiot thinks that?!
",4122171,Robot #1 Devil," You!
",622172,Benders ghost," You're usin' my own words against me!  Go to Hell!
",5222173,Robot #1 Devil," Soon enough. But, first, the killing. Have you noticed that animals are sometimes spooked by Robot ghosts?
",10822174,Benders ghost," So what?! I hate animals!  Run for your life, Fry! Move your hemp flaps!
",7422175,Robot #1 Devil," He can't hear you, Bender. I'm afraid your friend is about to be Fully Buckminstered!
",8722176,Benders ghost," Oh, yeah? I'll just jump into a machine and get his attention that way.
",7322177,Robot #1 Devil," Ah, but there aren't any machines on this planet!
",5122178,Benders ghost," There's one, you rusty, old dummy.
",3622179,Robot #1 Devil," Hey, no fair! Ocupado!
",2422180,Benders ghost,"  Got you! Get over here, Devil!
",3322181,Fry," And Scruffy's buffet? How's that going?
",4122182,Benders ghost,"  Fry! Fry! Look out for that bowlin' barn!
",4422183,Fry," Bender?! Is that thou?
",2422184,Benders ghost,"  I love you!
",1422185,Amy," Oh, my God! That was close!
",2922186,Hermes," Did you see that?
",1922187,Leela," Are you okay? What just happened?
",3522188,Fry," Well, I think the Robot Devil said he'd loved me in Bender's voice, wearing Granny Hester's clothes. I wanna go home!
",11922189,Robot #1 Devils ghost," You still lose, Bender. You failed to kill Fry, so you are banished to Hell.  I get a new body and you get to be a translucid chump 'til the end of time!
",15522190,Benders ghost," Big deal! I saved my friend. As far as I'm concerned, I won.
",6222191,Robot #1 Devil," Uh, really?   You may find your victory pyrrhic, when subjected to this lyric, for a trillion years or so. Yeah!
",11422192,Benders ghost," Whoa!
",722193,Robot #1 Devil," Hey, where are you going?!
",2822194,Benders ghost," I don't know and I don't care!
",3222195,Benders ghost," Yeah, I'm back!  Wait. This is my stop!  Oh, this guy...
",5822196,White Robot #1," Bender, for your selfless act in saving Fry, I am pleased to welcome you to Robot Heaven.
",9122197,Benders ghost," Shut up, God!
",1522198,White Robot #1," Beg pardon?
",1322199,Benders ghost," I wanna go back to Robot Earth. I mean regular Earth.
",5522200,White Robot #1," Hey, what are youâ€”  Ow! Hey, stop that! I command you, you jerk!  Just get out.
",8122201,Fry," Woo! I've been through the adventure of a lifetime.  Ow!
",5822202,Bender," I'm back, baby!
",1722203,Fry," You're back from the dead?!
",2922204,Bender," I'm back from lots of stuff.
",3022205,Fry," Oh, Bender, Bender, I missed you so much!  Hey, wait. Did you haunt me?
",7322206,Hermes," Well, we're bankrupt in six, five...
",3822207,Hermes," Four, three...
",1622208,Hermes," Two, one. And we're out of business.
",3822209,Farnsworth," Good news! We're back in business. We've been hired to deliver an envelope.
",7722210,Leela," It's crunch time. Let's do this.  It's for you, Professor.
",6022211,Farnsworth," Great delivery, everyone. You're the finest crew I've had the honour to work with.  Oh, my. We're being foreclosed upon. You're all terrible and incompetent!
",15922212,Amy," I resent that!
",1622213,Hermes," Wait. I found a loophole in the mortgage. If we actually pay it, we can keep the building. We just need...  Eleven million dollars.
",13322214,Bender," And... Boned!
",1522215,Farnsworth," Aw. I suppose there's nothing left to do but move out. Leela, Amy, pack us a lunch for our new lives under the bridge while us men reminisce and smoke some stogies.
",16622216,Leela," We are not packing lunches, you walking beer commercials. It was you men who drove this company into the ground. Remember Fry's idea to offer free delivery?
",15822217,Fry," It got us a lot of customers!
",3122218,Leela," We're a delivery company!
",2722219,Amy," If you wanna save this company, you should listen to a woman's idea for once.
",7922220,Hermes," Okay. What you got?
",2122221,Leela," An airline!
",1322222,Amy," Yeah! Wait, what?
",1922223,Leela," We should become a commercial airline. I mean, we've got a ship, and teleporters won't be invented for another fifteen years, according to that guy from the future.
",16622224,Amy," Wow! That's actually a really good idea for a woman!
",5422225,Farnsworth," Puff! What else you ladies got?
",3322226,Bender,"  Girls-of-Planet-Express calendar!
",3622227,Fry," Girly calendar? Great idea, Amy!
",3422228,Hermes," Okay, then. Leela, Amy, come to work topless tomorrow.
",5622229,Leela," Forget it! I promised myself I wouldn't pose naked until I was married.
",7322230,Hermes," Sorry. It's in your contract. ""All female employees must pose nude if requested.""
",8322231,Leela," That's discriminatory!
",2422232,Hermes," No, it's in all our contracts. Here's mine. ""All female employees must pose nude if requested.""
",9722233,Fry," Sounds fun.
",1322234,Bender," Back to work, Hermes!
",2322235,Scruffy," Now that's what I call fine print.
",3622236,Amy," Okay, but good luck making a girly calendar with only two female employees.
",7722237,Labarbara," Oh, husband! I'm so excited about this new job.
",4922238,Hermes," And it's excited about you, LaBarbara. First order of business is to put on your uniform and take your ID photo.
",11422239,Leela," Look, I agree that it makes space walking more comfortable, but, for a photo shoot, it's a little... Unsavoury. Over.
",11922240,Bender," Time is money, peaches. Now shut your com link and make love to the camera. And remember: I'm the camera.  Stop actually washin' and play with the sponges!
",15722241,Leela," But the ship is dirty.
",2422242,Bender," Uh, whatever. I ran out of film an hour ago.
",4622243,Farnsworth," No, no. This won't do. A three-month calendar? What is this, Mercury?
",7122244,Amy," I told you it wouldn't work.
",3022245,Farnsworth," Well, you should've talked louder. Fortunately, I came up with a brilliant idea to save Planet Express. We'll turn it into a commercial airline!
",14622246,Leela," But that was my idea!
",2322247,Farnsworth," Then you should've talked louder.  What?
",4222248,Leela," There. It was hard work, but it beats posing in demeaning, skimpy modelling outfits.
",8622249,Farnsworth," Ladies, here are your demeaning, skimpy stewardess outfits.
",6122250,Bender," Sorry, ma'am. I'll have to confiscate your artificial knee cap.
",6522251,Hattie McDoogal," Okay, here you go.
",2022252,Fry," Ladies and gentlemen, this is the plane's president speaking.
",6322253,Fry," We are cleared for takeoff.
",2922254,Leela," You put Goofus and Ganja in charge? I'm the only trained pilot here.
",7022255,Farnsworth," Please, Leela. Who ever heard of a plane with a woman president?
",6622256,Bender," Welcome to Plan Am Flight 1 to Acapulsar. The local time on Acapulsar is five years from now.  In the event of a wormhole sendin' us back in time, do not kill your parents. If you who are travelling with small children, help them not to kill you before not killin' your own parents. Now please turn off all electronic devices.
",32822257,Fry," Uh, preparing for takeoff.
",2822258,Man #1," I kill you, my friend!
",2422259,Labarbara,"  I hope you all enjoyed our timey beverage service.  Now sit back and endure our in-flight entertainment.
",10722260,Zoidberg,"  Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!  So what's the deal with airline food, hmm? They offer you two choices, but they're always outta one. Uh, by the way, we're outta both choices.
",16422261,Petunia," Shut up and put on four episodes of Da Office.
",4822262,Amana," Ooh, your hands are warm...  For a Robot.
",4322263,Bender," Thanks, baby. I don't know what you're doing back here in the galley, 'cause you got a first-class C.
",10322264,Leela," Captain, we were supposed to land two days ago. Is everythingâ€” Hey!
",6922265,Fry," Are we at the fair yet, Mommy?
",3222266,Leela," We're not at the any place! And we're out of fuel!
",5222267,Amy," Attention, passengers. Please remain seated until the plane comes to a complete crash.
",8822268,Farnsworth," Perhaps we should reconsider the girly calendar.
",5022269,Leela," Flight-attendance log. We've crashed near a river of mercury on a lifeless, mineral world. Supplies are low. Cannibalism, imminent. Radio, busted. Our one hope is to form a society.
",18322270,Hermes," Okay, then. Men, let's get hunting. The women folk can cook what we catch.
",7622271,Labarbara," No one put you in charge, husband. I'm the only one here who ever ran a society.
",8222272,Hermes," Roller derby is not a society!
",3222273,Labarbara," Well, let's put it to a vote, then. All in favour of the jamooca thunderclap?  That would be me.
",9822274,Hermes," Practically no one. All in favour of me?
",4222275,Dr. Cahill," Eight to eight. It's a tie.
",2922276,Farnsworth," We can't trust a woman's math! Count again!
",4522277,Big rock Alien," Greetings, soft ones. Who among you is your leader?
",5322278,Men," He is!
",822279,Women," She is!
",922280,Big rock Alien," Curious. You're a diarchic society?
",3722281,Hermes," Um, maybe. But, whatever we are, I'm the leader of it.
",5622282,Labarbara," Leader? Fat man, you couldn't even run a bath.
",4822283,Labarbara," Well, you sure can run something: Your mouth!
",4722284,Big rock Alien," Silence! Even a young pebble could see your race is divided based on the configuration of your twenty-third chromosome.
",12122285,Amy,"  You mean, ""along gender lines""?
",3422286,Big rock Alien,"  Gender?
",1022287,Sal," Yes. You knows, guyses, galses... In that order.  Ows!
",5622288,Big rock Alien," I am not familiar with this concept of gender. My species has only a single gender, known as nuchacho.
",10422289,Zoidberg," Interesting.  Come on, men! Let's kill him!
",4522290,Big rock Alien," Your genders differ in many ways, but, as with all things that are different, chocolate and vanilla, Mac and PC, one is always clearly better.
",14422291,Bender," Chocolate, Mac, men. The end.
",3122292,Big rock Alien," Well, I've got nothing to do for the next eight million years. Therefore, I will administer a series of tests to determine the superior gender. Test number one: Who can drink the most sulfur? Test inconclusive. Test number two: Who can drink the most arsenic?
",26122293,Farnsworth," Just ask us some damn questions.
",3422294,Big rock Alien," Very well. Which is larger? An Italian size four or an American apparel medium?  How many calories are in a small green-tea yogurt.  Name any twelve of the Desperate Housewives.  How was your day?  Test complete. What is the score?
",23322295,Bender," Uh... Men, five. Women, less.
",3122296,Amana," Hey! He's lying.
",1822297,Big rock Alien," Obviously. That was a test to see who could lie better. The men win that round.
",8122298,Farnsworth," In your face, decumbent urinators.
",3622299,Big rock Alien," So far, I have learned nothing, but that's probably as much my fault as yours.  The time has come for the final test.
",11922300,Fry," Uh, we usually call it the lightning round.
",4522301,Big rock Alien," As you may have noticed, it's getting hotter here.
",5222302,Leela," It's nice.
",1222303,Fry," It's too hot.
",1522304,Zoidberg,"  Would one of you chicks change the thermostat?
",4922305,Big rock Alien," Tomorrow morning, this planet makes its closest pass to the sun. You will all be boiled alive like retired circus animals. Unless you somehow can cross the Great Alkali Plains and reach shelter in the Cave of Harmony.
",21922306,Fry," That sounds hard.
",1922307,Big rock Alien," Which ever gender reaches the cave will survive and may the inferior gender burst into something. Flames, I guess.
",11622308,Hermes," Uh-oh. I think we're walking in circles. I recognise the pattern of striations on that gypsum formation.
",10622309,Fry," Also, my shoe that fell off.
",3022310,Bender," Oh, God. We're all gonna die in agony.
",4022311,Small rock Alien," Howdy there. You fellows need some directions?
",4822312,Bender," No, we're fine.
",1722313,Farnsworth," Beat it.
",1022314,Fry," Don't worry about it.
",2322315,Labarbara," Keep it up, sistren. Only a few more miles to the cave. Let's just buckle down andâ€”
",8522316,Amy," Look! A clearance sale!
",2522317,Labarbara," What?! Where?
",1522318,Labarbara," I can't believe that sale was just a mirage. Now we're going to die without so much as a factory second-clutch purse to show for it.
",13422319,Amy," It would've been nice to shop at Tommy Hilfiger one last time.
",6422320,Hattie McDoogal," It wasn't Tommy Hilfi-gigger. It was Linens 'n Things!
",5622321,Petunia," The hell it was! It was a Juicy Couture!
",4222322,Leela," I guess we all saw what we wanted to see.
",4322323,Hermes," We can't make it tonight. We'll set up camp here by this shoe.
",6422324,Farnsworth," Oh, gentlemen. When that sun rises in the morning, we're toast. These are our last moments together. So, if anyone's got any good fart jokes, now would be the time.
",16622325,Amy," It's a schmundered degrees and all we have to drink are non-diet sodas.
",7322326,Petunia," It's gonna ruin ma figger.
",2822327,Leela," Wait. I forgot that Amana here is a refrigerator. If we could supercharge her freon with a gas compressor, we might survive the heat and make it to the cave.
",15922328,Amana," Hey, yeah! But the only gas compressor on this planet is inside Bender's ass.
",7922329,Dr. Cahill," Was that a fart joke? Because I don't find those amusing.
",5922330,Labarbara," No one does! Nevertheless, Bender's gas blaster may be our only hope.
",7122331,Hermes," Oh! Wife? What are you doin' with Bender's shiny metal, gas compressor?
",7322332,Labarbara," None of your Biz Markie. Wait a second. What's that do wah in your ditty bag?
",7922333,Hermes," Okay... So we were hot. I stole Amana's freon coil so we could hook it up to Bender's ass and build a cooler.
",11122334,Labarbara," You are no better than me, ya shifty tree skink! How do you live with yourself?
",8122335,Hermes," Damn it, woman! You are makin' me highly Selassie.
",5222336,Labarbara," Don't you talk to me that way, you big, hairy Belafonte!
",5822337,Hermes," Oh... You cookin' me back bacon. Thank you, woman.
",5222338,Labarbara," That's not back bacon! That's your back bakin'!
",4922339,Hermes," Oh, no! We overslept.
",2322340,Amy," The mercury's boiling!
",2422341,Petunia," Can't breathe... Lungs burnin'...
",3522342,Fry," My lucky shoe!
",1622343,Bender," Goodbye, cruel me!  I learned that from a movie.
",5022344,Big rock Alien," I find both genders supremely disappointing. The real reason I administered this bizarre, outer-space test was to teach you to work together! But you couldn't. Thanks to you, I lost my bet with the Borax Kid.
",21022345,Fry," Never bet against me being stupid.
",3622346,Big rock Alien," Enough! Your gender differences have kept you from achieving harmony. There is only one way to resolve this conflict.
",11922347,Fry," Wait. Why didn't that hurt?  My wing-wang's gone!
",5122348,Leela," My girls!
",1122349,Bender," My antenna!
",1322350,Hattie McDoogal," My kajigger!
",1422351,Zoidberg," My gonopores! Look it up.
",2722352,Big rock Alien," I have freed you from the tyranny of gender. Now go in peace. Or actually stay here. I'll go in peace.
",10422353,Farnsworth," Good news, nuchachos! The ship is nearly repaired.
",5222354,Sal," Work goes fasters withouts no secondary sex characteristicses at which to hoot. Now who wants to sing some Christopher Cross songs?
",13322355,Labarbara," I do!
",722356,Fry," Look, associates. I made a hammock from our clothing.
",5522357,Leela," How industrious!
",1822358,Amy," Do you mind if we sleep with you?
",3522359,Fry," I have no opinion.  Well, good night.
",3922360,Hermes," Everyone got along so well today.
",3522361,Labarbara," Yes. This place is like a neutered utopia.  A neutopia!
",5722362,Hermes," I enjoy humour when no one gets hurt.
",3922363,Labarbara," Your companionship is inoffensive, Hermes.
",4422364,Hermes," Likewise. Really, what are we missing out on by not having sex right now?
",7522365,Labarbara," Well...
",922366,Hermes," Give us back our genitals!
",2822367,Big rock Alien," Is that you, Borax Kid? I've got your fifty bucks.  Oh, it's you. Why do you want your genders? You seem happier without them.
",12822368,Labarbara," Bein' Human isn't just about bein' happy! It's about lovin' and fightin' and that rasta MacNasty we were doin' last night.  We want that back.
",14422369,Big rock Alien," Very well. Perhaps it is I who have learned a lesson. Or something.
",6922370,Bender," Now what?
",1122371,Big rock Alien," I have decided, after little thought, to return your genders.
",6322372,Amy," Not cool, bro! Our genders are all reversed!
",4622373,Hattie McDoogal," Now I got a what-ya-call-it instead of a kajigger, you stupid what-ya-call-it!
",8022374,Big rock Alien," Okay. Stop yelling at me! It was an innocent mistake. Allow me to rectify it.
",7922375,Zapp," I got your distress call and came as quickly as I wanted to. No need to thank me.
",8322376,Leela," What's your problem, Holmes? Now we'll be stuck like this forever!
",6822377,Zapp," Chill out, dude.  Well, hello from the neck down.
",5122378,Bender," Thank you for your patronage. We know you have a choice in airlines and you made the wrong one. No refunds!
",10922379,Hermes," Aren't we going to cuddle?
",2822380,Labarbara," Woman, I'm tired! I'm sorry. It's just... I need my sleep. I got to get up five times a night to play Xbox.
",10922381,Hermes," I understand. Womanhood also takes some getting used to. For example, did you know there are more than two feelin's?
",11822382,Labarbara," I only need one feelin': Love for you, wifey man.
",5122383,Hermes," Your manwich!
",1522384,Labarbara," No wonder it's such a mess in there. These bad boys are hard to aim.
",7022385,Leela," I hate being a man. I smell bad, my face is scratchy, and the food at those strip clubs is terrible.
",10222386,Amy," Crappin' A! Still, I'm sure the women are having an even harder time.
",7122387,Bender," OMG! Being chicks is so much fun.
",3522388,Fry," Now, when I say stupid things, guys all laugh and buy me stuff.
",6522389,Leela," What a skank. Anyway, Planet Express is still facing foreclosure. There's no way we can raise enough money to save this company.
",13022390,Amy," Wait. What about the girly calendar?
",3822391,Fry," Well, that won't work, remember? We only have three women on staffâ€”
",6922392,Labarbara," ""All female employees must pose nude if requested.""
",5322393,Leela," And it is requested.
",2222394,Farnsworth," Let's just hope we can sell enough of these calendars by tomorrow.
",6822395,Farnsworth,"  We sold enough of those calendars since yesterday!
",5322396,Leela," Thank God most of our fans are huge perverts!
",4722397,Fry," Who're you, stranger?
",2322398,Borax Kid," Well, madam, folks called me the Borax Kid. My friend, the other rock Alien, died without settin' your genitals to right, so I reckon it's up to me to sex you up proper.
",17122399,Leela," My girls are back!
",2022400,Fry," Ow! Yay!
",1022401,Hermes," So what did you like better, my love? Bein' a man or a woman?
",6322402,Labarbara," I don't care what parts I have. As long as they interlock with yours.
",7122403,Farnsworth," Ah, marriage. It combines the contentedness of being neutered with the occasional sex of being not.
",10122404,Borax Kid," Well, I'd best mosey on down to the landing. Sounds like the feldspar queen is about to set sail. You folks watch your genitals now.  Come on, boy! Giddy up!
",15922405,Leela," And that's that.
",1822406,Scruffy," What I miss?
",1422407,Albert," I got one!
",1222408,Warden Vogel," Okay, kids. Put away the dust motes 'til tomorrow.  It's story time!  Today's storyteller is a space captain who grew up right here at the Orphanarium. Welcome back the bedwetter of building D, Turanga Leela!
",21022409,Leela," Hi, kids!  What book would you like me to read first?
",5522410,Albert," We don't got books no more.
",2922411,Leela,"  What?
",822412,Warden Vogel," He means any more. Look, sometimes you gotta choose between eatin' and reading.  So they ate the books. Just... Make somethin' up!
",13222413,Leela," Make something up? Um... Okay.  Once upon a time, there was a... A...
",7122414,Sally," Princess?
",1122415,Leela," Yes! That!  A... One-eyed princess in a long, flowing... Tank top. And she lived in a magical, one-room...
",10822416,Sally," Castle?
",922417,Leela," Yeah. If you believe the listing agent. Anyhow, one day, the princess went off to... Uh... Tell a story! And, then, that's exactly what she did do that. And they all lived happily ever after. The end.
",20222418,Albert," Miss Leela? I have a question!
",3222419,Leela," Yes, Albert?
",1422420,Albert," That story was bad.
",2122421,Leela," That's not really a question.
",3122422,Albert," That wasn't really a story.
",2922423,Leela,"  I'm sorry, kids. I'm not a natural storyteller.   But I promise: I'll make up a better story and come back again.
",11622424,Sally,"  Please don't...
",1822425,Leela," See you soon!
",1522426,Leela," I'm sure I've got a great kids' story in me. I just need to think of three of some kind of animal. Concentrate, Leela! Concentrate!   Fry, I'm writing here! Do you have to play that?
",18422427,Fry,"  Yes.  It's the only song I know.
",3522428,Zoidberg," Look, friends! I accidentally learned to tap-dance!
",5322429,Leela,"  Zoidberg, I'm trying toâ€”
",2722430,Hermes," Time for my four-twenty-one daiquiri!
",3922431,Bender," Guys! Guys! Guess who just got commissioned as a tugboat!
",5922432,Amy," Oh, yeah! Pachinko break!
",2722433,Pachinko machine,"  Tokyo crazy balls! Yes!
",2622434,Farnsworth," Ooh, good, Leela. You're here.  I'd like to describe my foot pain.  My left has a sharp jabbing throb near the bunion, while the other's got a searing pain like gout.  Maybe it's too much albumin because of gravity...
",21922435,Leela," Even if I had a pen, I couldn't write under these conditions.  I'm going to some other planet, where I can concentrate.
",12122436,Farnsworth,"  Searing, searing pain that feels as if it were in a vice.
",6022437,Bender,"  Well, that was rude.
",2322438,Leela," Warden Vogel, I have a new story for the children.  I'm sure they'll like it more than my last one.
",10122439,Warden Vogel," They liked hunger cramps more than your last one. Anyhow, you'll have to wait. The kids are busy right now.
",10922440,Leela," Oh. Is the organ-harvesting clown here?
",4122441,Warden Vogel," Nah. Rusty comes on Tuesdays now. Today, it's the owner of the Tickelodeon Kids Network.
",9022442,Abner Doubledeal," Okay, kids.  Get ready to be subjected to our new Fall shows! Mr. Funny Bunny here will gauge your reaction by bombarding your brains with harmless snuggle rays.
",16322443,Albert," He gives me a nice, warm feeling in my eyeballs!
",5022444,Male voice #1," Popular Slut Club.
",2022445,Little girl #1," Oh, my God!  There's Jake Thinkleburg!  He's so hot!  I wish he wasn't my brother.
",8422446,Male voice #1," Popular Slut Club.
",2022447,Male voice #2," Look! Up on the drive-through menu! It's Captain Mega Meat and his young ward Bottomless Boy!
",9522448,Bottomless Boy," Hurry, Captain!  A skinny kid needs our help!
",4722449,Captain Mega Meat," Supersize me!
",1522450,Male voice #3," From the ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper daycare centre in Glasgow, Scotland, it's Extreme Toddler Wrestling!
",9922451,Abner Doubledeal," Thanks for the brain scans, kids.  Don't have any children for the next couple of days.
",8922452,Warden Vogel," Alright, boys and girls. Enough fun! Your old friend Leela is back with a brand-new story!
",9222453,Leela," Hi! It's great to be back.  I think you'll enjoy this one.
",6022454,Sally," Please!  Can't we just get our organs harvested?
",5022455,Leela," It's about some cute, little creatures from a land called Rumbledy-Hump.  Kids, let's meet the Humplings! 
 My name is Lady Buggle and I huggle all my friends. 
 I'm a silly spring named Doingg and my bouncing never ends.  Doingg. Doingg. Doingg. 
 They call me Princess Num Num. I'm as sweet as sticky buns. 
 I'm Feffernoose. 
 Hello. 
 I'm scared of everyones.
 Oh, Feffernoose. 
 What about me? 
 Hey, it's Garbly. Everyone loves him 'cause they can't understand him.
 It's nice to meet you.
 We're here to make you laugh and think and smile and learn and sing.
And laugh and learn and smile and think and other happy things.
",63122456,Albert," Say more things like that!
",2822457,Leela," Okey-doke. One sunny, funny day, there was an unfamiliar visitor in Rumbledy-Hump.
",8422458,Leela,"  Today we learned that folks are not as different as they seem. 
 The space gorilla's just like us.
 Although I breathe chlorine.
",13122459,Sally," Wow! I can't believe you imaginated all that stuff!
",5322460,Nina," Will you come back again and tell us more stories and also adopt us all?
",7422461,Leela," Of course I'll tell you more stories.  I'll go think some up right now.
",7322462,Abner Doubledeal," Holy moly!  Lady, you don't know me, but my name is Abner Doubledeal.
",7122463,Leela," Wait! I know you! You're Abner Doubledeal!
",4422464,Abner Doubledeal," I brain-scanned those little nose-pickers during your story. And, sister, their enjoyment glands were squirtin' like Broadway roadkill!
",13722465,Leela,"  Aw.  They were?!
",1922466,Abner Doubledeal," Say, you seem like a smart mark.  How'd you like to make it into a TV show? Sign here, 'round this... Uh...  Supercuts coupon.
",12822467,Leela,"  I dunno.  Don't I need a degree to write gibberish for toddlers?
",6722468,Nina," Come on, Miss Leela!  Don't be a fraidy cat like Feffernoose!
",6322469,Leela," Okay. I'll do it!  To show you kids you can succeed at anything.  If you just luck out hard enough.
",10122470,Abner Doubledeal,"  Welcome to the glamourous, big-money world of basic cable TV!   I'm gonna need that pen back.
",9622471,Hermes," Working on a real TV show is so exciting! I'm on a mostly natural high!
",7322472,Amy," These costumes are gonna make it hard to go to the bathroom.
",6222473,Fry," I'm not havin' any problem.
",2922474,Abner Doubledeal," We're shooting in five minutes and this Leela broad hasn't even delivered a script yet! Sweet Zombie Jesus! Like it's not hard enough to make a freakin' TV show for under fifty bucks!  Damn it, I'll call you back, grandma. Nice of you to show up, toots. I mean that sincerely. It's just that I'm in show biz.
",31022475,Leela," Sorry. I went to my quiet place to write. Here's the script.
",6222476,Abner Doubledeal," Argh! You writers make me sick. Nice job on the script, though. Places, everyone.  Okay. Cheap lights. Off-brand camera. And non-union action!
",14422477,Fry,"  I like ice cream. And I like lollipops. And I like you, Princess Num Num.
",7622478,Amy,"  Ew! I'm all licky-sticky!
",2822479,Fry,"  I don't understand. When I like something, I lick it. Like this raccoon.
",7522480,Leela,"  Doingg! Don't lick things that don't wanna be licked.
",5622481,Fry,"  But how do I know what to lick and what not to lick?
",5522482,Leela,"  It's very simple.  If it's alive, don't lick it.
",5122483,Zoidberg,"  Like a horse, a turtle, or a cricket.
",4022484,Bender,"  I like turtles.
",1822485,Leela,"  So, if you're not sure if it's alive or dead,
Poke it with a stick and lick the stick instead.
",9722486,Fry,"  Now I get it!
",1622487,Zoidberg,"  Ow!
",622488,Leela,"  Well, that's all for today. But, before we go, let's do everything we just did two more times.
",9722489,Bender," Leela, that was great! Even I have to admire the performance of me, Bender!
",7722490,Amy," The show looks so cute. Kids'll love it! And it looks so cruddy, their ironic hipster parents will love it.
",10922491,Leela," Thanks, guys. But let's be realistic. We all know any TV show that's even slightly good gets cancelled. Sometimes, two or three times.
",13622492,Abner Doubledeal," Leela! Tomorrow's ratings just came in from the future. We're a hit!
",7022493,Leela," What?! My show is a hit?!
",2722494,Abner Doubledeal," What are you, deaf? It's gonna be bigger than SpongeBot SquareBolts!
",7022495,SpongeBot SquareBolts," I interfere with pacemakers!
",3022496,Abner Doubledeal," Baby, I hope you like drowning in caviar. 'Cause that is how you're gonna die!
",8022497,Calculon," Welcome back to the Young People's Choice Awards. In a moment, the award for Outstanding Sext Message. But, first, the nominees for Best New Kids' Show are... Yo Gimme Gimme!, The Adventures of Pit-Bull and Scaredy Squirrel, Dora the Destroyer, and Rumbledy-Hump.
",26522498,Fry," I hope you win, Leela.
",2422499,Leela," Thanks, Fry. It's nice to have the support of viewers like you.
",6522500,Fry," I'm the star of the show.
",2722501,Leela," Shh!
",622502,Calculon," And the Slurmie for Best New Kids' Show goes to... Turanga Leela for Rumbledy-Hump!
",8522503,Female Voice," This is Turanga Leela's first nomination and second time in high heels.
",7322504,Leela," Wow. I feel so lucky just to have been nominated alongside so many inferior shows. And, to all my young friends at the Orphanarium, thank you for inspiring me to be your hero.
",17722505,Calculon," Slurm her!
",1222506,Bender," So wait. You play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star who's also secretly a massage chair?
",11022507,Fembot #1," No. I play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star, but, in real life, I'm a massage chair.
",10722508,Bender," Hmmm. You ever made out with a tugboat?
",4122509,Leela," Guys, I didn't have time to mention it up there, but I want each of you to know what an honour it is to work with me.
",11922510,Hermes," Sweet ego of Montego! Someone build a wind farm in front of her mouth.
",7222511,Abner Doubledeal," Leela, I mean this. You're the greatest creative mind since blah, blah, blah-bity, blah. But it's two AM and you still haven't written tomorrow's episode.
",15622512,Leela," Well, you can't expect me to write it here, with everyone talking so loudly about how great I am.
",9922513,Abner Doubledeal," Sorry.
",822514,Leela," I'm taking the ship to my quiet place so I can be alone. You non-creatives can catch a bus home.
",9822515,Fry," Non-creative? Ha! I'll have you know I bedazzle my own underpants.
",6822516,Bender," That was a helluva massage. Maybe the best there ever was. Say, where are we? Rumbledy-Hump?! It's real!
",10622517,Doingg," I love eating vegetables. Don't you? They're like crunchy, green water.
",7322518,Garbly,"  I don't like 'em. They're icky-yucky!
",4022519,Lady Buggle," Now, now, Garbly. If we don't eat our vegetables, we won't grow big and strong... Like Feffernoose.
",10122520,Feffernoose," I have to be big and strong to fight off the monsters. Did somebody say monsters?!
",8422521,Leela," This will make a great episode. But talk slower. I can't type that fast.
",7422522,Bender," Well, well, well. You didn't make up that TV show! You just wrote down what these space twerps said!
",10222523,Leela," Oh, hell.
",1122524,Princess Num Num," Leela said a Rumbledy-Hump no-no!
",3522525,Humplings,"  Sometimes, when we're mad,
We say words that are bad.
",5622526,Humplings,"  And poo-poo and pee-pee and penis and gay.
Those are the ninety-eight words we don't say.
",9222527,Bender," My God. You stole all your ideas from those poor, innocent creatures and hogged all the credit?! I underestimated you.
",12022528,Leela," Wait! I can explain.
",2222529,Bender," Nah, don't ruin it. I'm lovin' the hypocrisy. It's like catchin' an evangelist in a whorehouse. That was the best Christmas ever.
",13122530,Leela," You know I hate lying. But those orphans were so proud of me, I couldn't bear to let them down.
",9722531,Bender," Pfff! At least Reverend Pickens had the dignity to jump out the whorehouse window with his pants around his ankles.
",11722532,Princess Num Num," Who's your friend, Leela? He sure has a shiny metal bumbledy-boop.
",6822533,Bender," Aw, they're so cute and harmless. No wonder you feel safe rippin' off their act.
",8222534,Leela," Bender! I feel bad enough already.
",3622535,Bender," I'm just messin' with ya. I love that you're gettin' rich off of them. 'Cause, now, I can get rich off of you!
",11222536,Leela," Oh, Lord.
",1122537,Bender," From now on, you give me half the gross or I'll blow your cover.
",6622538,Leela," Fine. You'll get your cut. I don't really care about the money, anyway. I just wanna show those poor, disadvantaged orphans that they can succeed in life.
",15622539,Bender," Ugh. You are the worst kind of rich person.
",4522540,Leela,"  Be it parsnips or peppers or kale or zucchini.
",4922541,Fry,"  I like to relax with a spinach martini.
",4222542,Bender,"  A-gurgle bufwoozle didoodi houdini.
",3822543,All,"  'Cause we love our vegetables.
",3322544,Abner Doubledeal," And... Cut! That's a wrap, everybody. Ten-minute break, then we shoot season three.
",8522545,Fry," Leela, you may have become a Lady Gaga-esque fame hag, but you sure cheered up those orphans. Nice job.
",10522546,Warden Vogel," Thanks so much for inviting us to the taping. The kids haven't been this excited since food day!
",9822547,Leela," Aw, thanks. They're my inspiration.
",3722548,Bender," But not your only inspiration. Am I right, Leels?
",5122549,Albert," Is somebody standing on me?
",2922550,Bender," I do love inconveniencing the underclass.
",4322551,Warden Vogel," Well, we'll be on our way. After we dig through your trash for aluminum. Okay, kids. Delta pattern. Go! Go! Go!
",11322552,Sally," Miss Leela?
",1322553,Leela," Yes, Sally?
",1322554,Sally," I wanna show you the story I made up. That's Gum Drop, Sticky, Candy Corn, Sour Ball, and Jujube. They're brothers and sisters and they live in Butterscotch Hollow.
",16622555,Leela," Sally, that's wonderful. You came up with that yourself? Out of thin air? How?
",8022556,Sally," You were an orphan and now you're the best writer ever, so I knew I could write too. Thank you for being my hero.
",11522557,Leela," I can't do this any more.
",2722558,Farnsworth," I don't blame you. Having to wear a costume made from a hollowed-out walrus...
",8022559,Leela," Everyone, I have a confession. I, Turanga Leela, winner of a Young People's Choice Award, a Peabody Jr, and two Training Emmys, am not what I appear to be. There's something I need to show you.
",19522560,Bender," Uh-oh.
",822561,Leela," Continuing my confession, this is the hardest thing I've ever done.
",6922562,Sally," Harder than creating the bestest show in the world?
",5322563,Leela," I didn't create anything. I stole it.
",3922564,Bender," Stealin' is a form of creativity!
",3522565,Leela," No, it isn't. Guys! Come on out!
",3422566,Abner Doubledeal," Holy moly again.
",1822567,Lady Buggle," Oh, hello, Leela. I was just telling my friends how they shouldn't eat food off the floor. Should we sing a song about it?
",12422568,Fry," Yes, please!
",1422569,Leela," No need, Lady Buggle.
",2322570,Abner Doubledeal," Say, what's goin' on here?
",2822571,Leela," This planet is the real Rumbledy-Hump. And these creatures are the real Humplings. All I did was write down their adorably repetitious hijinks.
",14522572,Sally," You lied? Like Doingg did when he stole Garbly's pet pinecone?
",6422573,Doingg," You told them about that?
",2722574,Leela," I should've told the truth right away. These simply prairie folk have a simple prairie-ish life here. And I was wrong to exploit it for profit.
",14522575,Lady Buggle," I'm as sad as an upside-down smile.
",3722576,Leela," You mean a frown?
",1922577,Lady Buggle," We didn't have a word for it... Until now.
",4422578,Amy," To think I put on an unflattering cupcake costume for you!
",6022579,Fry," To think I borrowed money from you!
",3722580,Albert," I was gonna ask you to marry me.
",3422581,Sally," I guess, if you can't make up stories, I can't neither.
",5722582,Leela," I deserve this. And more. Keep it coming!
",4322583,Abner Doubledeal," Wait a second. As a big Hollywood TV producer, I think I know how to remedy this ethical lapse.
",9722584,Lady Buggle,"  So if you don't want a tapeworm or intestinal bug...
",5522585,Humplings,"  Don't eat pastrami that fell on the rug.
",4322586,Abner Doubledeal," And... Cut! Ta-da! We got us a reality show! No writers. No actors. No problem.
",8122587,Leela," Doubledeal, this is disgraceful! You can't just rip off their real lives and put it on TV!
",9222588,Abner Doubledeal," Wha? Who said anything about rippin' them off?
",4822589,Leela," I did!
",822590,Abner Doubledeal," I'm payin' 'em. Gather 'round, gang. Here're your pay checks.
",6322591,Garbly,"  I can finally afford my speech therapy!
",4222592,Feffernoose," And the health plan covers my generic Prozac!
",4722593,Lady Buggle," Electricity, plumbing... Our lives are a jillion times better. And it's all thanks to you, Leela.
",9922594,Leela," Don't thank me! I should be punished! I've corrupted you and taught the orphans a terrible lesson.
",10022595,Warden Vogel," What orphans?! The kids were all adopted!
",4322596,Leela," They were?! By who?!
",2222597,Abner Doubledeal," Come on, kids. Let's get this place cleaned up for the next episode. Albert, pick up that pastrami and put it back on the craft services table.
",14522598,Albert," You're the boss, Daddy.
",2522599,Leela," Oh, God! What have I done?!
",2922600,Nina," You've given us a new father and a full-time job! Which is more than most kids have!
",8622601,Leela," Butâ€”
",622602,Sally," We love it here, Miss Leela. This is the funnest planet in the whole world!
",7722603,Leela," Don't hug me! I've done a horrible thing! For God's sakes, somebody teach me a lesson!
",8822604,Orphans and Humplings,"  We love Leela!
",1722605,Leela,"  No!
",622606,Fry," Run, Leela! They're bouncing right at us!
",4322607,Bender," So... Anybody hungry?
",2322608,Fry," I could stuff myself.
",2322609,Leela," I'll use that free app that tells you what restaurants you're near.
",6922610,Fry," You mean the window?
",2222611,Leela," Yes.
",622612,Lrrr,"  I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8! I demand extra dipping sauce!
",8122613,Teenaged Alien," How many?
",1122614,Lrrr,"  Uh... Two.
",1322615,Fishy Joe," Welcome to Fishy Joe's. Today is Stroganoff Thursday. We are currently out of the following menu items.
",10522616,Female Voice," Stroganoff.
",1322617,Teenaged Alien," May I take your order?
",2422618,Fry," I'll have the Stroganoff.
",2722619,Teenaged Alien," Okay.
",722620,Bender," Yeah, uh, gimme the fried spaghetti dinner breakfast pocket for lunch an', uh, a big bucket o' mixed sodas.
",10922621,Teenaged Alien," One kids meal. Got it.
",2422622,Leela,"  Huh. Buggalo tots?
",2122623,Leela," What exactly are those made of?
",3322624,Teenaged Alien," You got a warrant?
",2022625,Leela," I'll just have something from the lite menu. How about the gardener lover's salad?
",8422626,Teenaged Alien," What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?
",4522627,Leela," Ugh! Just gimme the fruit cup!
",3222628,Teenaged Alien," Okey-doke. What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?
",5622629,Leela," Oh, God! Fruit is spelled F-R-O-O-T. And it's got quotation marks around it.
",7822630,Fry," Mmm. There's nothin' wrong with a little fast food once or twice a meal. Heart... Attack! I'm fine.
",10122631,Leela," Oh! I got a bone in my fruit! That's it. From now on, we're not eating anything unless we know what it is an' where it's from. We're going to the local farmers market.
",16922632,Bender," Aw, mom! Do we hafta?!
",2422633,Leela," This is what I'm talkin' about! See all the dirt an' earwigs? That's the sign of healthy food.
",9622634,Hydroponic Farmer," You think that's healthy? Try this. I found it growin' at the bottom of my hamper.
",8422635,Leela," Mmm! So fresh an' musty!
",2622636,Bulb," It's what I do.
",1722637,Thog," Hello, tiny man. You want sample small-batch Amazonian maple syrup?
",6922638,Fry," Sure. That's the kinda sap I like.
",3622639,Thog," You the kind of sap I like.
",2922640,Fry," I'm scaroused!
",1622641,Bender," Zuban tobacco?! The richest, most obnoxious kind! Listen, pal. I'm lookin' for a versatile smoke. One that's equally good in a crowded elevator or an audience with the Pope.
",17522642,Moustached Alien," Forget the Pope, my friend. Smoke one of these and God himself will ask to be seated far away from you.
",10522643,Bender," Ooh!
",622644,Leela," Heirloom eggs?! That's so life-affirming! I'll bet you run your own hatchery. Just you and your wife... Matilda.
",11422645,Brown-haired man," No, ma'am. Matilda an' I gather them eggs in the forest. And Matilda's really more of a mongoose than a wife.
",11122646,Leela," You're a lucky man. But are they way more expensive than regular eggs?
",7222647,Brown-haired Man #1," Way more.
",1122648,Leela," Ooh! I'll take a dozen.
",2522649,Farnsworth," Wha?! You're not my breakfast friends! What are you doing here?!
",6622650,Amy," Leela blackmailed us all into eating healthy, organic food.
",6122651,Farnsworth," Blackmail? What does she have on you?
",3922652,Hermes," As long as we eat 'er filthy scrambled eggs, you'll never find out.
",6922653,Leela," They're not filthy! They're wholesome, fertile, and fresh from the forest floor. There's some filth.
",10222654,Fry," FERTILE? What does that mean?
",3122655,Zoidberg," It means it'll hatch into a tiny, little infant creature. Unless we cook it first. Hey, Leela! Hurry up with those scrambled infants!
",13522656,Fry," What?! That's horrifying! Zoidberg, you're an in-Human monster.
",6522657,Zoidberg," What are you? My driver's license?
",3622658,Fry," Eating a sweet, innocent chick before it's even hatched?! Oh-ho-ho-ho, no, you won'tn't! I refuse to eat an unborn animal! I'm gonna keep this egg safe and warm and secure. Until it hatches out into the world. And then I'm gonna eat it!
",23822659,Leela," Should we turn on the TV?
",2722660,Hermes," Nah.
",622661,Fry," Bender, d'you mind? I'm roosting.
",3522662,Bender," I'm considerin' buyin' a yacht to house my Thoroughbreds. How d'you expect me to do that without smokin' a cigar?
",11522663,Fry," Think of the unborn embryo!
",2922664,Bender," That's what I'm gonna call the yacht. Stop pickin' me! Whoa!
",6222665,Fry," Hey! Leggo my egg-o, crab-o!
",3022666,Hermes," Stop it, Fry! That's sexual harassment!
",4122667,Zoidberg," Yeah, come down off your round, white pulpit! You're just gonna eat that thing, anyway!
",8922668,Fry," I was, but you can't sit on something for a week without falling in love with it. Whoever's in here deserves a chance at life. A chance to blossom into a beautiful young man. Like I did as a baby. And so I make this solemn vow... To do everything I can to make sure this wonderful, innocent creature enters this world happy, healthy, an'â€” All yours, Zoidberg.
",36122669,Bender," Aw! Look at the cute, littleâ€” I was gonna go yachting in those feet!
",7022670,Leela," Relax, you babies. It's no different from stomping a puppy.
",6122671,Fry," Everyone stop! He's not gonna hurt you.
",4122672,Bender," I'm standin' in a pool of my own feet!
",4022673,Hermes," Bender's right! Kill it before someone names it!
",5022674,Fry," No! Mr. Peppy just wants to be our friend.
",4422675,Hermes," Oy!
",522676,Fry," Look: I know 'e's ugly and kinda corrosive, but we can't murder someone just 'cause he's hideous an' annoying.
",11222677,Amy," That's what we said about Zoidberg and look what that got us.
",6322678,Zoidberg," Amy has a point.
",1822679,Fry," Mr. Peppy's not like Zoidberg. He's my friend.
",4822680,Zoidberg," Aw!
",522681,Calculon," Where to... Adulterers?
",2522682,Monique," Calculon?! Then it wasn't your body they found in the harbor after the bomb went off.
",8722683,Calculon," What bomb?
",1222684,Bender," It takes more than that to surprise me, Bender.  What you doin', little buddy? Uh, yeah... Uncle Bender... He's your friend.  Huh? Oh, you wanna play fetch!  Come on, boy! Get the ball.  Dumb jerk. Come on! Get the ball.
",22222685,Hermes," Sweet freak of Mozambique! That thing's colossal! It's gonna kill us all!
",7522686,Amy," It's so huge! How big does one o' those things get?!
",5422687,Fry," Well, that depends on what one o' those things is. That seems like a fact worth knowing.
",9022688,Farnsworth," Good, startling news, everyone!
",3322689,Farnsworth," I found a description of the creature in this medieval monster manual. Just as I feared. Attack type J.
",10522690,Amy," No!  No!
",1022691,Farnsworth,"  Yes!  It kills its prey by sucking out the skeleton, leaving nothing but a puddle of flesh.
",9422692,Amy," Ew!
",522693,Leela," Ugh!
",622694,Bender," Ew!
",522695,Farnsworth," Hence the Latin name bonus vampirus. Or, as you non-Catholics would say, the bone vampire!
",9222696,Zoidberg," Dios mÃ_o.
",1122697,Fry," That's ridiculous. Mr. Peppy doesn't eat bones. I raised 'im on a simple diet o' Brussels sprouts an' mixed soda.
",11522698,Hermes," At least there's only one of 'em. The good news is they can't start breedin'.
",7922699,Farnsworth," The bad news, everyone, is the beast reproduces asexually. A single bone vampire, left alone with some quiet music and some bone-vampire porn, could produce dozens of deadly offspring.
",18622700,Zoidberg," That lucky bastard. I say kill it!
",3622701,Fry," But it loves me! And I love it.
",3322702,Zoidberg," Kill 'em both!
",1622703,Leela," Killing them seems like a hassle. Can't we just set it free to live with its own kind?
",8822704,Farnsworth," Poor, ignorant Leela. The bone vampire is now extinct on its home planet.
",7522705,Leela," That's perfect! We can reintroduce it to the wild and repopulate the species!
",7922706,Fry," Yeah! Let's do those Leela things.
",3622707,Fry," Well, buddy, how d'ya like your new home? See? He's happy already.
",6822708,Hermes," That thing doesn't have emotions, Fry. Its brain is the size of a walnut.
",7522709,Fry," So are walnuts and they're delicious. I'll miss you, Mr. Peppy. But you'll be happier here. So... Go on. Go. Goodbye, Mr. Peppy. Come on, man. Don't do this. Go on now. I mean it. Don't make this any harder than it has to be. It's time to let go! Ow! Thanks, Leela. He just needed a little extra push.
",30322710,Leela," Come on, Fry. Let's go home an'â€”
",3422711,Bender," Hold up! There's alcohol around here somewhere. My Tanqueray-dar is goin' crazy. Aha-ha! Thought you could get away from me, huh? You lose again, you stupid intoxicant!
",17022712,Zoidberg," We're not from around here. Hello!
",3622713,Man #1," 
",222714,Hermes," Excuse me, but we're guests on your planet. Speak English!
",6022715,Man #1 #2," Behave yourselves, gents. Off-worlders best be welcome here. Especially if we're trying to get the Olympics. May I buy you a drink? We don't get a lot of pretty faces around here.
",18122716,Leela," Uh... Sure. But I'm driving. I'll just have the smallest whisky you've got.
",7722717,Man #1 #2," A small aquarium o' whisky for the busty lass!
",4822718,Leela," Thanks. I suppose I should know your name if I'm gonna be drinking ten gallons of alcohol with you.
",10122719,Man #1 #2," McZongo. Angus McZongo. Major Angus McZongo. Handsome Major Angus McZongo. Esquire.
",8522720,Leela," Ooh! Handsome and esquire. I'm Turanga Leela. My crew an' I are from Earth.
",7722721,Angus McZongo," So what brings you folks here to Doohan 6?
",4422722,Amy," We just released an endangered animal back into the wild. A bone vampire!
",7522723,Hermes," No need to thank us. Your shocked stares of gratitude say it all.
",6722724,Angus McZongo," Dear God. You brought back the bone vampire?! The damn things wreaked bloody havoc on our livestock for centuries!
",11622725,Woman #1," Aye! Until McZongo 'ere shot 'em all into extinction, 'e did.
",6322726,Man #1 #3," Now we've got more livestock than we can slaughter. Oh, aye. 'Tis a Bonnie time to be an ignorant villager.
",10922727,Man #1 #4," We kinna have no murderin' bone vampires back 'ere!
",5322728,Man #1 #3," Kill it afore it puts a bun in its own oven and repopulates the bleedin' planet!
",8222729,Fry," No!
",522730,Angus McZongo," Angus is right.
",1722731,Hermes," I thought you were named Angus.
",3322732,Man #1," We're all named Angus!
",2422733,Fry," Please! Mr. Peppy won't attack your livestock. He's a vegetarian and 'e's not even preachy about it!
",10222734,Angus McZongo," Poppycock. Once he gets the smell o' bones, there'll be no stoppin' 'im. Tonight, Mr. Peppy must die.
",10322735,Leela," Angus, wait. My strictly platonic friend is right. At least wait a few days before you decide to kill it.
",10722736,Angus McZongo," The last time I hesitated, a bone vampire snicked out me left shin.
",6922737,Leela," Please! Just a few days.
",2622738,Angus McZongo," Well, 'twould give us a chance to get to know each other. The beast lives! For now.
",8522739,Leela," Thank you, Angus.
",1922740,Men,"  You're welcome!
",1822741,Fry," I don't trust that McZongo. Maybe I should go keep an eye on Mr. Peppy.
",7322742,Leela," Don't worry about McZongo. He an' I are having brunch tomorrow. I'm thinking of wearing this.
",9522743,Fry," It's nice! But there's still somethin' I don't like about that guy. My dad always said you could tell a lot about a man by the rigidity of 'is shins.
",15122744,Zoidberg," What is?!
",1122745,Man #1," UNKNOWN, Gryffindor, Slytherin an' Hufflepuff! It killed Little Angus!
",7222746,Farnsworth," They're all dead! And their bones are gone! This was no accident.
",6722747,Angus McZongo," Still think your Mr. Peppy is harmless, Fry?
",4622748,Fry," He wouldn't do this in our sleep. He would not, could not to a sheep.
",7122749,Angus McZongo," The deal is off! The beast must die!
",3822750,Bender," Ooh! Pimpy!
",1322751,Fry," What are we supposed to do? Just sit here and wait for Mr. Peppy to be killed?
",8022752,Bender," Sounds like a plan! Guess I'll pass the time by lightin' up an El Jerko!
",7422753,Leela," Okay! That's it! I need some air.
",3522754,Leela," Who's there? Hermes, is this one o' your zany practical jokes?
",6422755,Fry," Leela, are you okay? Did you drink too many aquaria?
",5422756,Hermes," Look! The bone vampire!
",2522757,Leela," Mr. Peppy attacked me. Quick! Count my bones. There should be two-hundred-and-five!
",8522758,Leela," Okay. That's better. Keep 'em comin'!
",3922759,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Fry, but no vegetarian could've done this.
",5522760,Fry," I know. An', as much as I love Mr. Peppy, I love Leela more. He has to be... Put down.
",8822761,Amy," Aw, don't feel bad. Major McZongo's an experienced hunter. He'll blow Mr. Peppy's head off as painlessly as possible.
",11922762,Fry," No! Not McZongo! If anyone's gonna kill Mr. Peppy, it should be me.
",6922763,Zoidberg," Fry, I know you're upset right now, but I hope you'll consider donating the body to science dinner.
",10122764,Fry," Here, Mr. Peppy. Mmm. Lovely bones.
",3722765,Hermes," We've been walkin' for hours. I hope we can find our way back.
",6422766,Amy," Don't worry. I left a trail of bread crumbs.
",4622767,Bender," An' I left a trail of cigars!
",3122768,Leela," You don't have to do this, Fry. Mr. Peppy just gave me a little love concussion.
",8222769,Fry," Thanks, Leela, but I have no choice. I can't let my monstruous deboner get anywhere near you.
",9522770,Hermes," There it is!
",1422771,Fry," Well, this is it. You guys wait here. This is gonna kill him more than it does me. Goodbye, boy. I'll think of you whenever I sit on something round.
",15122772,Amy," What's happening?! Did you kill it?!
",3822773,Mr. Peppy," The bloody idiot bloody-shot me! I'm all bloody-bloody!
",5722774,Bender," Wha?!
",722775,Fry," Mr. Peppy?! Bullets make you talk?!
",3722776,Bender," That's not Mr. Peppy!
",2322777,Amy," Jinkies! He Scooby-Doo-ed us!
",3122778,Leela," Why, Major McZongo? Why?
",2622779,Angus McZongo," Oh, it's been thirty years since last I killed a bone vampire. The villagers dinna idolise me like they used to.
",11422780,Amy," You seem pretty popular at the pub.
",3722781,Angus McZongo," I work there as a greeter! Your beast was my chance to be a hero again. But the damn thing was a vegetarian! So I slaughtered the sheep meself.
",14522782,Leela," But why did you attack me?
",2822783,Angus McZongo," So I could impress you by seeking revenge on the creature. Us greeters don't get a lot of action. On paper, it seemed like a win-win situation.
",14522784,Farnsworth," Do you realise what this means, Fry?! Your pet's not dangerous after all!
",7522785,Fry," I told ya! Mr. Peppy's a lover, not a fighter. Like Dwayne ""The Rock"" ""The Tooth Fairy"" Johnson.
",9822786,Zoidberg," UNKNOWN! Hey. What's that bone-sucking sound?
",4722787,Fry," It's Mr. Peppy! I'd know 'im anywhere.
",4022788,Leela," Huh. So, apparently, Major McZongo and Mr. Peppy were each doing about half the sheep killing.
",9622789,Fry," Why, Mr. Peppy? Why? Ooh. That tickles. Now I really do have to kill you.
",7522790,Man #1 #3," Wait! Don't shoot. The beast is a godsend. Like I said, we've more livestock than we can slaughter. But, thanks to this ravenous bogle, that's nae more a problem.
",16422791,Man #1 #5," Angus is right. The cursed thing even debones 'em. Which is perfect for today's fast-paced, lazy consumer.
",10822792,Man #1," Dersu Uzala, Yojimbo, Rashomon! The beast must live!
",5422793,Leela," You know what the best part is? From now on, whenever we're eating fresh, organic space meat, we'll know exactly where it comes from.
",13522794,Fry," One bucket o' double-friend, triple-salted, boneless sheep tots, please.
",7422795,Teenaged Alien," What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?
",4522796,Fry," All kinds.
",1222797,Leela," Eh... Make it two.
",2022798,Leela,"  An' a small whisky. Large.
",2922799,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Remember when you asked to see my family tree?
",6922800,"Leela, Bender, Zoidberg, Hermes, Amy, and Fry"," No.
",522801,Farnsworth," Ta-da!  This is my ancestor Philo Farnsworth, inventor of television and, as a bonus, childhood obesity.  And here's Dean Farnsworth, developer of the Farnsworth test for colour blindness.  Where is he, blast it?!  And, just recently, I learned of a modern-day Farnsworth, who invented the anti-senility truss.
",31222802,Leela," That's you, Professor.
",2422803,Farnsworth," Wha?!  Ah, yes. The Farnsworths boast a proud and distinguished lineage. No wormy fruit on this tree.
",10322804,Amy," What about Fry?  Isn't he your distant uncle?
",4722805,Farnsworth," Very distant. Not a true Farnsworth, mind you.  He's way over here on this filthy branch riddled with fungus and dung beetles.
",12822806,Fry," What's with the seventeen dung beetles?
",4122807,Hermes," Well, it's six o'clock.  I guess we'll have to deliver that Human heart tomorrow. Good work, people!
",10222808,Bender," Woohoo! Time to go clubbin'.  Baby seals, here I come.
",5622809,Fry," Guess I better head over to my night job.
",4322810,Leela," You have a night job?
",2322811,Fry," Yup. It's exhausting, but I need the extra money to buy coffee so I can stay awake for my night job.
",10222812,Leela," Butâ€”
",622813,Fry," Gotta go!
",1122814,Fry,"  Woo!
",722815,Dr. Cahill," You've got a surprising amount of algae in your beard, Mr. President. Just sit still and let the algae eater do its work.
",12322816,Abraham Lincolns head," Ooh! Ow!  Ooh! Lay off my trademark mole.
",4322817,Dr. Cahill," Hi, Lars.
",1122818,Fry," Fry.
",622819,Dr. Cahill," Whatever.  I'm heading out to my night job.  Remember: No loud noise, no head bowling, and no parties. Or it'll be your ass in a jar!
",13522820,Fry," I wanna go to that museum!
",2822821,Bill Clintons head," Man, this place is a snooze. Hey, Fry, I challenge President Taft 'ere to a pie-eatin' contest.
",9722822,William Tafts head," You're on, skinny!
",2022823,Fry," Sorry, guys. You know the rules. ""No fun allowed.""
",5222824,Andrew Jacksons head," Come on, you pansy! I'm thirsty. I want me some Tennessee loopy juice!
",7222825,Warren Hardings head," And I want loose women. The kind that aren't afraid to show a little ankle.
",7722826,James Madisons head,"  Or elbow.
",1222827,Fry," No visitors! I'll lose my job.
",3222828,Rutherford B. Hayes head," Oh, boo-hoo! I'll lose my minimum-wage job.
",4522829,Fry," You're mean, Rutherford B. Hayes!
",3522830,Franklin D. Roosevelts head," Listen here, young man! We have nothing to fear but running out of beer.
",7422831,Fry," Alright. One small get-together. But let's keep it quiet and dignified.
",7322832,Zoidberg,"  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
",3822833,Bender," Woohoo! Yeah, alright!
",2422834,"Scruffy, Leela, Hermes, and Bender"," Four more beers! Four more beers!
",3522835,Amy," Yes! Right in the ike!
",2422836,James Madisons head,"  Nice elbow action.
",2122837,Hermes," So... You grow hemp?
",2222838,Thomas Jefferson," Yes.
",622839,Hermes," And... You do what with it?
",2922840,Thomas Jefferson," All manner of things. Manufacture paper, fabric, rope...
",5822841,Hermes," Oh. Well, nice talking to you.
",3222842,Thomas Jefferson," Why, I used to smoke about four feet of rope a day.
",5322843,Hermes," Let me give you my pager number.
",3422844,Farnsworth," Hey, Reagan. Remember when you asked to see my family tree?
",6122845,Ronald Reagans head," I asked you to leave me alone.
",3222846,Farnsworth," The Farnsworths are a remarkableâ€”
",3522847,George Washingtons head,"  Farnsworth?!  That name is a stain on American history! One of the worst traitors of the Revolution was a Farnsworth!
",12022848,Farnsworth," You're lying!
",1522849,Leela,"  He's George Washington! He tends not to do that!
",5122850,George Washingtons head," David Farnsworth was a notorious British agent and counterfeiter.  He conspired to bring down our nation with his fraudulent currency.
",13622851,Farnsworth," A Farnsworth did this?!  Oh, dear! My good name is ruined!
",6022852,Gerald Fords head," Hi! I'm Jerry. I like movies.
",3122853,Bender," Anyone seen Ulysses Grant?  He owes me a cheroot.
",5122854,Leela," He's over there, pukin' in the Bushes.
",4022855,George H. W. Bushs head and George W. Bushs head,"  No!
",622856,Fry," Oh, boy.
",1022857,Dr. Cahill,"  Mr. Fry!  Why are all these people standing around?   When they should be partying!
",8622858,"Amy, Bender, and Hermes"," Alright!
",1022859,Zoidberg," Hey, hey, LBJ. You wanna get drunk?
",3722860,Lyndon Johnsons head," Oh, hell, yeah.  Whoa!
",2422861,Farnsworth," Zoidberg, no!  The effects of jar juice aren't fully understood!
",6622862,Zoidberg," Uh... Not bad. A hint of vitalis andâ€”
",3922863,Amy," I recognise this!  It's the 1960s!  I did a report on it for my drug-taking class.
",8422864,Blond man," Hi. I'm Andy Warhol and you're some kind of... Marvellous lobster man.
",7222865,Zoidberg," Right on! Say, you got any real soup or just this schlock?
",6022866,Andy Warhol," What a horrid bore.
",2122867,Farnsworth," Ooh.
",622868,Amy," Wha?
",622869,Zoidberg," Far out! That head gave me a total head trip!
",4722870,Fry," Really?!  I'm gonna lick Herbert Hoover's head!
",4922871,"Zoidberg, Leela, Amy, Hermes, and several heads"," Lick the head!  Lick the head!
",3222872,Bender," Whoa! A speakeasy.  One prohibited beverage, please.
",5422873,Bartender," Hey, Dutch. The new still is here.
",3622874,Bender," I'm not a still!  I just smell like one!
",4222875,Male voice," Dutch Schultz, come out with your bootleg whisky. We're thirsty!
",6622876,Hermes," What the heck is goin' on?! Jefferson, did you sell me some bad rope?!
",7222877,Farnsworth," It must have something to do with the jar fluid.  Aha!  Dr. Cahill, do I detect a trace of opal essence?
",10622878,Dr. Cahill," Very observant, Professor. To preserve the heads, we use a rare form of powdered crystalline opal.  This is the world's entire supply.  Yet it's so powerful, it should last a thousand years. It keeps the heads alive, but... We don't know how.
",24422879,Amy," Why did it give us those hallucinations?
",4222880,Farnsworth," Because it didn't!
",2022881,Amy," Uh... Yuh-huh!
",1622882,Farnsworth," Opal has unusual temporal properties.  It preserves each head in a time-stasis bubble. Ergo, licking those heads actually sent us back in time to their original eras.  Look!
",17522883,Zoidberg," Fuh! Schlock and more schlock!
",3222884,Dutch Schultz," Pssst! Is the coast clear?
",2822885,Bender," Button your yap, you mug!
",2722886,Farnsworth," I've discovered a new means of time travel! I'll call it the Farnsworth effect!
",8122887,George Washingtons head," Nice try.  But even this discovery won't undo the treachery wrought by your nefarious ancestor David Farnsworth.
",11422888,Farnsworth," It will if we go back in time and stop him!
",4522889,Leela," Professor, no!  You can't tongue the father of our country!
",6122890,Fry," Where are we? Also, when are we?
",3422891,Farnsworth," 68th and Broadway, colonial era.  Rush hour.
",4622892,Farnsworth," By my calculations, this head trip will last, at most, 24 hours. We need to stop that monster, David Farnsworth!
",11422893,Leela," Look at the date on this newspaper.  April 17th, 1775.
",5622894,Farnsworth," Say, on this exact date, the Continental Congress was meeting secretly in New York. Maybe they can help us.
",10922895,Bender," But they could be meetin' anywhere!  What are we gonna do? Search building to building?
",8922896,Farnsworth,"  We'll start with that one.
",2922897,Thomas Jefferson," Alexander Hamilton of New York, how say you?
",4622898,Alexander Hamilton," Nay.
",622899,Thomas Jefferson," John Hancock and John Adams of Massachusetts?
",4722900,John Adams," Yay.
",622901,John Hancock," Yay.
",622902,Thomas Jefferson,"  The yay's have it. Our nation's official joke state shall be New Jersey.  Uh-oh. 
",8422903,John Adams," Ah, 'tis just our new Crockpot.
",3322904,Bender," Watch it, Wiggy! I ain't no stinking crock!
",4522905,John Adams," We'll see about that in five hours. 
",3822906,John Hancock," Halt! From whence commeth thou, one-eyed maiden!
",5022907,Leela," Uh, ever been to Peru?
",2422908,John Hancock," Certainly not!
",1622909,Leela,"  I'm from Peru.
",1722910,Farnsworth," Clam up, founding fathers! We need help locating the treacherous forger  who forged this forgery!
",9922911,Thomas Jefferson,"  My word! If these enter circulation, our economy will be destroyed! And with it, our chance at independence!
",11122912,Alexander Hamilton,"  Only one man in the colonies has a printing press fine enough to make these. Our good friend, Ben Franklin.
",11022913,Leela," Uh-oh. Isn't Franklin in Philadelphia?
",4022914,Thomas Jefferson," When he's not in Charlotte, or Maribel, or Louisa!
",5222915,Fry," I don't get it.
",1722916,Farnsworth," I'm sure no one's ever said this before, but I must get to Philadelphia as quickly as possible!
",9722917,Farnsworth," Oh! Why couldn't my disgraced ancestor have lived in the NASCAR era?!
",7122918,Woman #1," Dr. Franklin, your new steam engine is here.
",4622919,Bender," I ain't no stinkin' steam engine!  Chicken's ready.
",5322920,Benjamin Franklin," You may go, Louisa.
",2122921,Fry,"  Now I get it!
",1622922,Benjamin Franklin," Fascinating. Be you man or machine?
",3722923,Bender," Mostly machine. Might be a couple dead cats in there.
",5522924,Farnsworth," Dr. Franklin, with all due respect to the brilliant inventor of the...  stove, I must speak with you.  I'm looking for the scoundrel who made  this!
",15022925,Benjamin Franklin,"  Intricate filigree, satanic symbols, looks like one of mine.  But no! This is a fake!
",8822926,Fry," Duh! It says  ""Colony of Maffachufetts""!
",4222927,Bender,"  More like ""Taxachufetts""!
",2822928,Benjamin Franklin,"  That's just how we print S's, you ""Æ’tupid Æ’hitheads""! Someone must've used my press while I was poking around in Charlotte. Let's ask my apprentice, David Farnsworth.
",16922929,Farnsworth,"  Farnsworth?!! That's him! Arm yourselves!
",4422930,Benjamin Franklin," I call it ""the Franklinator"".
",3122931,Benjamin Franklin," The apprentice's suite is empty! He's gone!
",4522932,Farnsworth," Wait! What's that glistening in the chamber pot?
",5022933,Bender,"  Let's find out.
",1822934,Leela," Bender, do you know what a chamber pot is?
",4422935,Bender," I don't know and I don't care!
",3222936,Farnsworth," A Massachusetts hapenny?
",2622937,Bender," Probably fake, too. There's one way to find out.  What?
",5722938,Fry," Bender bent a poo penny! Bender bent a poo penny!
",5122939,Benjamin Franklin," Look! 'Tis but worthless tin!
",3122940,Farnsworth," Where could Farnsworth have minted such a high quality fake?
",6222941,Benjamin Franklin," Not here. But, you know, I have a friend in Boston who's an expert silversmith. They could be connected.  There's only like forty people who do anything around here.
",16722942,Farnsworth," But Boston's 300 miles away and Bender kicked our horse to death! We'll never get there in time! Unless you have another ""invention"" up your sleeve! Foh!
",15522943,Benjamin Franklin,"  Hmmm...
",1022944,Bender," How's this going to get us to Boston?
",3922945,Bender," Stupid Franklinâ€” 
",1922946,Paul Revere," Ah, that scrap metal I ordered is here.
",4122947,Bender," I'm 40% scrap metal. 
",2322948,Paul Revere," Well, Ben Franklin,  my fellow Son of Liberâ€”  Tea kettles, heh. Yes, I've made some new tea kettles. Perfect for special occasions. Like hanging King George in effigyâ€”  and H and I are monograms you can put on those tea kettles.  Whatta you looking at, you British bastards?!?!?!
",28122949,Benjamin Franklin,"  Paul, we talked about this.
",3022950,Farnsworth," Mr. Revere, we're looking for a counterfeiter who minted  these smelly hapennies. His name is David Farnsworth.
",11322951,Paul Revere,"  Farnsworth? I just hired him for the fall candlestick rush. He's in the foundry this very moment!
",10022952,Benjamin Franklin,"  Everybody take a Franklinator.
",3322953,Fry," Aw, I gotta chipmunk.
",2322954,Leela,"  Hee-ya!
",1022955,ProfessorFarnsoworth," David Farnsworth, I presume?
",3022956,David Farnsworth,"  I'm David Farnsworth.
",2422957,Farnsworth," Fuff! You're a disgrace to the very name Fowvwuh!
",5122958,Fry," Look out! He's got a bezeling planisher!
",4222959,David Farnsworth," 'At's right! 'Oo wonts ta be bezel'd?!
",4022960,Bender," You idiot, I'm not a cannon!
",3022961,Bender," Oh, I guess I am a cannon.
",2822962,Farnsworth," Time to prune the family tree!  Huzzah! I've saved the Farnsworth name!
",7322963,Man #1," An urgent message for Mr. Revere!
",3522964,Paul Revere," Mr. Revere, pray, do not 'Æ’hit' your pants. The British attack has begun. Cross the river and watch for my signal.  I must ride.
",13022965,Leela," He has so much stuff.  He won't miss this.
",4422966,Farnsworth," Let's burn these counterfeits and paddle the next swan boat the hell out of Boston.
",8522967,Fry," Here you go.
",1422968,Farnsworth," Thanks.  Say, where did you get that lantern?
",4722969,Fry," From that old church to the north.  They had two burning, so I figured they wouldn't miss one.
",9622970,Paul Revere," One if by land. Two if by sea.   The British are coming! The British are coming!   By land! By land!  Gotta treat this OCD. Gotta treat this OCD.
",14722971,Farnsworth," Fry, you dope! You've really screwed the granny this time! History needed that second lantern!
",9622972,Leela," We better stop Paul Revere beforeâ€”
",3622973,Leela,"  I guess everything worked out jolly oll right, eh, guv'nor?
",6222974,Bender,"  Wot's with th' fruity accent, ducky? Bollocks! Ah've got it, too!
",6822975,Fry,"  Where's all th' Presidents' heads, then?
",4322976,Farnsworth,"  Ah say, appears we've changed 'istory too much, disahster of nightmarish proportions an' wotnot.  Quite.
",10722977,Hermes," Where 'ave you blokes been?  You nearly missed elevenses.
",5922978,Amy,"  Who's for tea and shmavories?
",3222979,Bender," Wot in bloody 'ell's goin' on aroun' 'ere ah says?
",5222980,Farnsworth," Indeed. Wot's become of the dear old USA?
",4322981,Amy," Beg pardon?
",1322982,Farnsworth," The Revolution? 1776 and wot all?
",3522983,Hermes," Oh, the Colonial Desktop.  Well, there's nuthin' we Brits enjoy more dan a good document'ry. Turn on the televiser, Dr. Zoidsmythe.
",13322984,Zoidsmythe," I'll dial up the Beeb. They've always got a nice doccy-woccy on. 
",6722985,Narrator," The Vanquished Pride of the Yankees,  or  America the Dutiful!  North America or Wes' Britannia as we now call it, has been under British rule for fourteen-hundred years...  all thanks to a nutter known as ""Wrong Way Revere"".
",22722986,Animated Revere," The British are coming, by land, by land! Heh heh heh heh!
",6022987,Narrator," But we came by sea, we did. Surprised the Yanks at Lexington ending the Rebellion with narry a kipper scuffed.
",11222988,Amy," Scuffed kippers, anyone?
",2622989,Zoidsmythe," Right kind of you, mum. 
",2622990,Narrator," The humiliated conspirators were forced to sign the Declaration of Dependence, proclaiming British rule forever.  Meanwhile, a loyal Brit by the name of David Farnsworth tracked down the traitor George Washington and bravely smothered him with his wig. 
",25522991,Farnsworth," Oh, criminy!
",1422992,Narrator," In gratitude, King George named Farnsworth a duke and granted his family massive land holdings in the colonies.
",11322993,Farnsworth," Blimey. I've never felt so ashamed to be a Farnsworth.
",5622994,Scruffy," Will m'lord be returning to his massive land holdings for luncheon?
",6922995,Farnsworth," Huh-woh?
",1022996,Leela,"  I know we're ladies-in-waiting but what are we waiting for?
",6222997,Farnsworth," How should I know? Just shut up and wait!
",4322998,Bender,"  Say, how is it that we've got socialized medicine  bot me teeth still loo' like this?
",8822999,Fry," Con't we just go back in time an' set things roight again?
",6023000,Farnsworth," Don't want to. Rather nice living under the crown and so forth.
",6523001,Zoidsmythe,"  Rather. 
",1123002,Farnsworth," Wot's more, couldn't go back even if we wonted to.  No more crystalline opal left in all the world, don't you know.
",11723003,Scruffy," M'lord, the Queen is here for 'er, eh, weekly, irrrrr, visit.
",6323004,Farnsworth," The Queen? Sounds most satisfactory. All of you out!
",5423005,Bender,"  Right, then. Let's go play some quoits...wotever that is.
",6023006,Squire," Presenting the Queen of England, America, and two parking spaces in Tokyo.
",7623007,Queen," Where's me consort at?
",2423008,Farnsworth,"  C-C-Consort?
",1523009,Queen," That's right, luv. Fer cent'ries, a Farnsworth gentleman 'as provided service to the Queen. Now close yer eyes an' think of England!
",13423010,Farnsworth," Ah say, what's that in your crown?
",3623011,Queen," You mean Andamooka Opal? Why, it's th' most precious gem in all th'â€” 
",7123012,Bender," Yes! Three rubbers on the hob!
",3223013,Queen," Stop him! He crowned me in th' knickers an' nicked me crown!
",6223014,Smitty," Freeze or we'll be forced to continue chasing you since we don't carry guns!
",7823015,URL," Indubitably.
",1423016,Leela," We've got to go back in toime an' set things straight! 'Urry up an' lick Washin'ton's 'ead again!
",9923017,Bender," We can't! There's no George Washington nor any other Presidents.
",6623018,Fry,"  Wot about this bloke?  'e's from Revolutionary times.
",5623019,Farnsworth," Farnsworth!
",1323020,David Farnsworth," Hey! Yer the plaunkers wot candlesticked me! Well, ah showed you! Ah killed George Washin'ton an' now I'm married to one of the Spice Girls! Don't rightly know which one.
",17223021,Farnsworth," Bender, fetch me that powdered opal!
",3823022,Farnsworth," It's time to restore dignity to the Farnsworth name!
",5423023,Fry,"  There. That time, I left both lanterns in place.
",5123024,Farnsworth,"  And I hit Farnsworth much, much harder. Eh, perhaps too hard.
",6423025,Leela,"  Look! All the Presidents are back! Even John Tyler!
",5423026,John Tylers head," That's the first time anyone's spoken to me in twelve-hundred years.
",7023027,Farnsworth," Yes, from Chester A. Arthur to Chester Z. Arthur, they're all here. Our republic and the Farnsworth family name are saved.  And no one will ever know.
",15223028,Yancy FrySr," Double time, soldier.  I want this ice-fishin' operation up and runnin' by oh-eight-hundred hours.
",10023029,Fry," It's too cold, Dad. My teen region is freezing off.
",5323030,Yancy FrySr," You dunno what cold is.  I once survived an entire week trapped in a Swiss glacier, eatin' nothin' but frozen Neanderthal.  To this day, I can't stand the taste of early hominid.
",18023031,Fry," Let's just get inside the shack.
",3423032,Yancy FrySr," Hold, maggot!
",1523033,Fry," Ow!
",523034,Yancy FrySr," Remember the code o' the ice! Thick an' blue, tried an' true. Thin an' crispy, way too risky.
",9523035,Fry," Shows what you know.  Crispy doesn't even rhyme with risky.  Help! I'm drowning!
",8223036,Yancy FrySr,"  Don't worry, son.  You'll freeze before you drown.
",5323037,Fry," I love ice fishing.
",2123038,Farnsworth," I shouldn't be out in this cold. I 'ave no protective fat, hair, or warm blood. I'm not even legally a mammal.
",11223039,Fry," Pfff!  You dunno what cold is.  I was frozen for a thousand years.
",6823040,Bender," You were?! Uh.  Learn somethin' dumb every day.
",4923041,Paper-hatted salesman," Live bait!
",1223042,Paper-hatted salesman," Get your live bait here.  Whoa!   Fresh-killed bait!
",5423043,Amy," Can we get inside the shack?  I'm wearing a belly parka!
",5823044,Leela," If I understand ice fishing, and I'm pretty sure I don't, we'll need to laser-blast a hole in the ice.
",10423045,Fry," No. No crazy technology.  Here. Bender, use your immense Robot strength to drill a hole the old-fashioned way.
",11223046,Bender," I don't see any irony in that.
",3223047,Fry," And... WoilÃ  !
",1623048,Fry," Everybody's ice-fishing!  How come nobody's ice-fishing?
",5823049,Bender," Hot-cocoa break.
",1823050,Fry," Cocoa is for yodelling babies.  If you're sober, it isn't ice fishing.
",7223051,Fry," Mom, what's my temperature?
",2923052,Mrs. Fry," Fifty. Forty-five.  Forty. It's all over!  Woo!  Down at the 35!
",6623053,Fry," I'm really sick.
",1823054,Mrs. Fry," Huh?  Oh, sorry.   Hundred-an'-nine.  We'll check again at half-time.
",7123055,Yancy FrySr," You home from school, you traitor?
",3623056,Fry," I fell through the ice!  Cut me some slack!
",4523057,Yancy FrySr," Nobody cut me any slack when I broke my spine.  Didn't even take a day off o' work.  Lotta people depend on you when you sell trampolines door to door.
",15323058,Yancy FryJr," Here's your homework, ya lucky knob.
",3823059,Fry," And, with a little more luck from my seven-leaf clover, I might get sick enough to miss the whole semester.
",10923060,Yancy FryJr," Hey, give me that!
",2023061,Fry," Ooh.
",623062,Yancy FryJr," Come on.
",1023063,Fry," No.
",523064,Yancy FryJr," Give it to me, ya faker!
",2623065,Fry," No. You're not gettin'â€”  Ow! My underbite!
",4423066,Yancy FrySr,"  Come on, Yancy!  Your brother's sick!  You'll never have a better chance to take 'im out.
",9223067,Fry," Dad!  Nerd Search '88?  What's this?
",3823068,Yancy FryJr," Some stupid science contest for smart wads.  NASA's gonna pick one kid's experiment to launch into space.
",10723069,Fry," I can make a space experiment.  I just got a new thing o' glitter!
",6823070,Yancy FrySr," I'm not sure science is your thing, seein' how that chimp at the zoo tricked you outta your allowance.
",10423071,Fry,"  Yeah, well, I'll show you.   And Mr. Bananas.  Anyway, I've got nothin' better to do while I'm sick in bed. Wait. That's it! I'll make a space experiment about the common cold!  Where's that contest flyer?
",20823072,Yancy FrySr," You're holdin' it, genius.
",2823073,Fry," Oh, good.
",1123074,Fry,"  I feel awful.  But it was worth it to catch an' kill this baby fish.
",7123075,Amy," Shmeez!  What's with the shmiffling?
",3823076,Fry," It's nothing.  Just a common cold.
",3623077,Zoidberg," Wha?
",623078,Bender," It's a common uh?
",1923079,Hermes," Wha?
",623080,Leela," What the hell's a common cold?
",3223081,Bender," Is it valuable? Could it be taken from you if you were, say...  Unconscious?
",7823082,Farnsworth," A commonâ€”  A common cold?! No!   No!   Ever since Fry first came to us, I've lived in mortal terror that this would happen!
",12523083,Leela," I never heard you mention that.
",3323084,Farnsworth,"  Oh, I try to act cool, but inside I'm  freaking out!
",5523085,Fry," It's just a cold!  What's the big deal?
",4123086,Smitty," This is the police.  An unknown pathogen 'as been detected on these premises.  Come out with your handsâ€”  I mean... Stay in with your hands up!
",14523087,URL," You are hereby quarantined until such time as it is deemed safe to enter and shoot your asses.
",9623088,Farnsworth," Eh, now, now.  Let's not all panic at once. We'll have to take shifts.  Hermes, you'll take the first six hours.
",11423089,Hermes," Very well.
",1223090,Farnsworth,"  Louder!   Louder!   Crybaby.
",3123091,Fry," Look: I just 'ave a common  cold!  It'll be gone as fast as I can sneeze, hurl, and squirt it out.
",10023092,Farnsworth," No, it won't!  The common cold died out five-hundred years ago. And, subsequently, Humanity lost all resistance to its ravages. But the virus survived in you...   Frozen for a thousand years.
",19323093,Fry," Huh.  So it was hiding deep down inside o' me? Like my skeleton bones?
",7223094,Leela," Give it to us straight, Professor. How incredibly deadly is it?
",6523095,Farnsworth,"  We don't know.  It could kill millions or nobody. I suppose it might even bring a few people back to life!  Anything is possible in science.
",14323096,Amy," Oh, no!  I've got it too!  My nose is all gunked up with blork!
",6523097,Hermes," And I've got a hankerin' for a useless remedy created by a schoolteacher.
",7523098,Zoidberg," Uh-oh. I think I'm getting swollen glands.
",4423099,Amy,"  Ew!
",623100,Hermes,"  Oh!
",623101,Farnsworth,"  Oh!
",623102,Leela," Screw the quarantine! I'm outta here!
",3923103,Female CDC scientist," Initiate containment procedure.
",3323104,Leela," Ah!  Ow!  Oh!
",1523105,Male CDC scientist," G'wan now.
",1223106,Farnsworth," Now I'm sick!  I shudder to think what this cold will do to me. Yesterday, I was nearly killed by a tight hat!
",11223107,Bender," I'd be remiss if I didn't rub your goopy noses in the fact that I'm immune.
",7723108,Farnsworth," Which is why we'll all be counting on you and you alone to nurse us through this catastrophe.
",9523109,Bender," Why, God?  Why 'ave I been singled out?
",4123110,Fry," Everyone just calm down and make yourself a tissue walrus.
",6023111,Yancy FrySr,"  Damn it, son.   Lose the tissues. You're ruinin' Thanksgivin' dinner.
",7223112,Fry," I'm busy with my space experiment. I can't devote precious brainpower to blowing my nose.
",9123113,Yancy FrySr," You're never gonna win that science fair, Philip. Face it:  Someone with your limited brainpower'd be lucky to get a job as a pizza delivery boy.
",14723114,Mr. Panucci," Hey, Barack!  Pizza goin' out.  Come on!
",4223115,Barack Obama," Man, I've got to go back to law school.
",4123116,Fry," Pfff!  I'm not gonna wind up a loser like that guy.
",5323117,Yancy FryJr," Sure you will.  You're gonna lose the science fair.  And that's who's gonna beat ya.   Josh Gedgie, boy scientist.
",11623118,Josh Gedgie," Pi over four radians of pizza, please.
",4023119,Mr. Panucci," What is that? About a slice?
",3023120,Josh Gedgie," More like exactly a slice.
",2823121,Fry," Game on, Gedgie.
",1823122,Yancy FryJr,"  Ew!
",623123,Yancy FrySr," I've 'ad worse. When I was shot down over Korea, I had to eat Kimchi.  He was our interpreter.
",9623124,Bender,"  Coming!
",1023125,Bender," What now?
",1123126,Amy," Humidifier.
",1323127,Bender," Fine.  Yes?!
",1423128,Leela," Where's that chicken soup we asked for?
",4123129,Bender," Chicken.  Water.  Fire.   You take it from there.
",5123130,Hermes," This is torture. The fever. The chills. And the sweating!  Amy's horrible sweating!
",8523131,Bender,"  That's it. I'm leavin' while I still 'ave my dignity.   See you in the obituaries!
",8523132,Male CDC scientist," How's the... Uh... Containment holdin' up?
",4423133,Female CDC scientist," Without turning my head, I'd say one-hundred percent.
",5523134,Bender," Howdy, folks. And may I say, ""Nice work keepin' those sickos penned up."" Put 'er there.  You too, buddy.  An' you.  An' you.  An' you.  An' especially you.
",15723135,Fifth CDC officer," That Robot was a heckuva nice feller.
",3923136,Fry," You'd better stay here during biology.  Mrs. Jenkins dissects anything smaller than a fifth grader.
",10123137,Josh Gedgie," Well, if it isn't Grandmaster Phlegm. I heard you're enterin' the NASA science competition.
",9323138,Fry," Maybe I am... LL Fool J!
",2623139,Josh Gedgie," So what's your project? The effects of losing on idiots?
",5823140,Fry,"  No!  I'm gonna infect my guinea pig with the common cold and launch it into space to see if it gets cured by cosmic rays!
",12423141,Josh Gedgie," Lame! Though the common-cold virus does seem like a judge pleaser.  I think I'll steal that an' do an experiment that's slightly less... Very stupid!
",15123142,Fry," But that's my idea! You are an evil, evil nerd!
",4923143,Josh Gedgie," Gedgie out!
",1323144,Fry," We'll show him who's stupid.
",3023145,Morbo," Linda?
",823146,Linda," Morbo. The so-called common cold, introduced by living fossil Philip J. Fry, is spreading out of control.  All citizens are advised to wash their hands thoroughly after beating up Philip J. Fry.
",19623147,Fry," Phew!  Lucky I'm safely locked up here with you guys.
",5523148,Amy," There 'e is!
",1423149,Hermes," Get him!
",1023150,Fry," Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! What are youâ€”
",3123151,Morbo,"  The situation is expected to deteriorate as newscasters whip the city into a panic.
",8623152,Morbo," Run! Run for your lives!
",2623153,Linda," And, finally, the heart-warming story of a handicapped magician who didn't know when to give up.
",9823154,Zapp," I don't like the looks of this, Mr. President.  Shall I switch it off?
",7223155,Richard Nixons head," Negative.  Rose Mary, release the Surgeon General!
",5223156,Woman #1,"  Get in there!
",1623157,Wernstrom," Ow!  It's bright out here.
",2823158,Richard Nixons head," Wernstrom...  The quarantine 'as failed. Give me a worst-case scenario. And make it grim.
",9123159,Wernstrom," I've prepared some projections.  Should the virus escape Manhattan, this is how far it will spread in twelve hours.  This is twenty-four hours.  This is a Verizon coverage map.  And, in thirty-six hours, it will have infected the entire planet!
",24623160,Richard Nixons head," Options?
",1023161,Zapp," We 'ave only one option.  Protocol sixty-two.
",4723162,Richard Nixons head," Not possible. We don't 'ave nearly enough piranhas!
",5323163,Zapp," Then protocol sixty-three it is.
",3423164,Hermes," Hooray!  They're letting us out!
",3423165,Zoidberg," And hundreds of black hovercopters are coming to welcome us!
",6223166,Hermes," They shrink-wrapped the hole city! Well, it could be worse.  It is worse!
",7523167,Zoidberg," They're flying Manhattan into the Sun!  They must've been outta piranhas.
",7523168,Hermes," They're gonna kill the virus by exposing it to the heat of our burning bodies!
",8023169,Farnsworth," I'm just glad I have my wool scarf.
",3723170,Fry," What good is a woolâ€”
",2223171,Bender," Guys! Guys! You're never gonna believe this!
",4623172,Amy," We know! They shmooped up Manhattan and blasted us toward the Sun!
",6823173,Bender," They did? Aw!  So that's why this was unguarded.
",5023174,Wernstrom," People of New New York, this is Surgeon General Ogden Vernstrom.
",6623175,Farnsworth," Wern--strom!
",1423176,Wernstrom," No doctor likes hurling his patients into the Sun, but, since there is no way to make a vaccine for the common coldâ€”
",11823177,Farnsworth," There is a way to make a vaccine!
",3523178,Fry," There is?   Yay!
",1823179,Farnsworth," Of course, there's a catch.
",2923180,Fry,"  Woo!
",723181,Fry,"  Woo!  Yay! Yay!  So what's the catch?
",4023182,Farnsworth," The vaccine requires the original, unmutated, 20th-century cold virus. So I need to grind you into a paste.
",10923183,Leela," Professor, no!
",1623184,Fry," It's okay, Leela. This is all my fault, sort of. If this will save you, then, please, turn me into a virus milkshake.
",11923185,Farnsworth," He consented!  You all heard it!
",3423186,Yancy FrySr," Yes, sir. Many of these entries merit a ride in the mighty bosom of our space shuttle.  And then there's your so-called entry.
",12823187,Fry," Jeez!  Walk much, Gedgie?!
",2823188,Josh Gedgie," Absurd. You really think your guinea pig could survive in the vacuum of space?
",8023189,Fry," He already survived in the vacuum of my mom.  I mean, ""My mom's vacuum.""
",7423190,Josh Gedgie," My experiment measures the effects of microgravity of the propagation of the common cold virus in an anaerobic environment; i.e., space.  Impressed?
",15023191,Yancy FrySr," Damn right I am.  That's some dry, emotionless science.  Nice job, son.
",7323192,Fry," Hey, wait a second!  I know where you can get some 20th-century cold virus without killing me!
",9623193,Farnsworth," Hush, lad.  I'm totally in the zone.
",3823194,Fry," We just 'ave to find the Nerd Search '88 satellite!
",5323195,Farnsworth,"  I don't know why I even build these things.
",4623196,Leela," Gunnery Chief Bender, blast us out of quarantine.
",5123197,Bender," Aye, aye, lady.
",1723198,Farnsworth," Oh, fiddlepoop! Our weapons aren't strong enough to puncture a thin plastic tent that thick?!
",9523199,Leela," No. But theirs are!
",2123200,Kif," Captain, a ship is attempting to break the quarantine.
",5623201,Zapp," Blow them to baco bits with a well placed warning shot!
",5723202,Kif," Butâ€”
",623203,Zapp," Oops.
",723204,Fry," We'll find that cold virus.  The Nerd Search satellite was launched on the space shuttle and released into orbit.
",11523205,Leela," Hmmm. All ancient satellites were swept up as space junk in 2113.  I actually knew that offhand.  I'm Facebooking right now.
",12623206,Farnsworth," Aha!  That satellite was scuttled on Enceladus, Saturn's main dump moon!
",7423207,Fry," Let's dump it up!
",1923208,Leela," This is the exact location of the dump.  But there's nothing here.
",6823209,Bender," Can we please go home an' die now?
",3623210,Farnsworth," I'm with Bender.  Whatever was here's been covered by centuries of ice buildup.
",8123211,Fry," No!  It's under here somewhere. We just 'ave to bust our way down.  Remember the code of the ice. Thin an' crispy, way too risky.
",13123212,Leela,"  I found a satellite!
",2323213,Fry," Let's just hope the experiment's still in here.  Yes! We're saved!
",6823214,Man #1," And now, to present the awards, our very special guest.  He walked on the Moon and now he is judging a high-school science contest.  Truly a man who can and will do anything... Dr. Buzz Aldrin!
",19523215,Buzz Aldrin," Wow!  I could've used an introduction like that when I first met the Moon men!  But, seriously, there are Moon men.  Okay. This year's Nerd Search runner-up is a young man who devised a way to add and subtract in zero gravity.  Vijay Patel and his calculator space hat!
",27123216,Vijai Patel,"  Woo!  Woo!
",1323217,Buzz Aldrin," And now the grand-prize winner whose experiment will be launched into space.
",7823218,Yancy FrySr,"  Look at that cocky smirk.   My money's on Gedgie.
",5223219,Fry," Yeah? He may 'ave brains, but I 'ave heart.
",4523220,Buzz Aldrin," Josh Gedgie!
",1423221,Yancy FrySr," I'll bring the car around.
",2823222,Farnsworth," What a well prepared virus culture.  This will make a fine vaccine.
",6923223,Fry," Good thing Gedgie won. My dumb experiment wouldn't've lasted an hour in space, let alone a thousand years. Besides, Buzz Aldrin ran over my guinea pig in the parking lot.
",17223224,Farnsworth," Eh, okay. Uh, come on, gang. Let's go inoculate everyone and cram Manhattan back into its rightful hole!
",10623225,Farnsworth," This may hurt a little.
",2523226,Wernstrom," Ow!
",523227,Farnsworth," Now, I'll give you the shot.
",3023228,Leela," You saved millions of lives, Fry. You should feel proud. No matter what your dad said to you.
",9523229,Yancy FrySr," You still 'aven't thanked me for pullin' you outta the lake, soldier.
",7123230,Fry," I could've flip-flopped out.
",3023231,Yancy FrySr," I know that.  Look, son.  I know I give you the business sometimes.  But, if I'm hard on you, it's only 'cause I want you to grow up strong and resilient.  Someday, you may face adversities so preposterous, I can't even conceive of them.  But I know you'll pull through and make me proud.  I love you, son.
",30823232,Yancy FrySr,"  Now, bundle up.  I don't want you gettin' frozen.
",5223233,Fry," Bucket of hot dogs?
",2123234,Cubert," Check.
",823235,Fry," Butt massager engaged?
",2423236,Bender," Check.
",823237,Fry," Then let the video games begin! Wait. Hang on. Iâ€” I lost my controller.
",7323238,Cubert," There is no controller. The X-Cube tracks your motions with a built-in camera.
",8023239,Bender," Oh, yeah? Track this motion.
",3023240,Cubert," Frykowski. BenderIsGreat34. Follow me!
",4023241,Bender," Sounds like fun on the bun.
",2923242,Cubert," Aw! You guys again?!
",2223243,German #1," Ach! These dorkeschoens. Let's humiliate them with slingshots.
",6423244,Fry," Shoot your weapon, Private!
",2923245,Bender," Wait. How do Iâ€” Hold on. Oops.
",3223246,German #1," Sorry to kill und run, but I really must be GÃ¶ring.
",5323247,Fry," Man!
",623248,Bender," Pwned again.
",1423249,Cubert," This is all Bender's fault. Admit it! Your reflexes suck!
",5923250,Bender," Aw... It's true! My circuitry's twelve years outta-date. I can't keep up with today's high-speed, top-o'-the-line kids.
",12123251,Fry," You can't even keep up with me and I'm some sort o' stone-age throwback.
",7423252,Cubert," You know... I might be able to speed up your reflexes by overclockin' ya.
",7523253,Bender," Eh... What's that, sonny? You say it'll put some whoopiee in my cushion?
",7423254,Cubert," This may take a while. I've got to adjust the memory timing, raise the CPU voltage, and delete twelve terabytes of outdated catchphrases.
",13923255,Bender," Sounds like fun on the bun!
",2923256,Female Voice," Deleted.
",1023257,Bender,"  Oh.
",623258,Leela," Fry, can we talk about our relationship?
",4223259,Fry," Of course. Our relationship is the best thing in my life, so I'm sure I'll enjoy talking about it with you.
",10923260,Leela," I dunno. I guess I'm just feeling uneasy about us being so on-again, off-again.
",8123261,Fry," Maybe it's none o' my business, but, if it were up to me, we'd be on all the time. An' I mean all the time.
",10923262,Leela," But what would that be like? I mean... If we were together, where would we be ten years from now? Still here?
",11123263,Fry," Definitely. Or... Somewhere else.
",3523264,Leela," Maybe I'm havin' some kinda... Early-life crisis, but... Look: Don't you ever wonder about the future?
",10423265,Fry," Well, sure, but... You're always in it. Also, sometimes, terminators.
",7123266,Cubert," Alright. You should run a lot faster now. Unless you die.
",5923267,Bender,"  Woo! I'm smart! I know how to spell aardvark. February is the shortest month. There's three-thousand-eighteen jelly beans in that jar.
",13723268,Cubert," Damn, I'm good.
",1723269,Bender," I mean three-thousand-eighteen rat kidneys.
",4523270,Cubert," Now, then, my man. Let's see if your reflexes areâ€”
",5223271,Bender," Faster!
",923272,Cubert,"  Get 'em! Get 'em! Get 'em!
",2923273,Bender," Eh, foreign aggressors. Vhat's up?
",3623274,German #1," Oh, we were just eating spaetzle and listening to Kraftwerkâ€” Iâ€” I mean, ""Fire!""
",8123275,German #2," That tap-dancing, decadent jazz baby is too fast for us!
",5823276,German #1," Let's see him outrun a V-2!
",2923277,Bender," It's my brains against your von Braun!
",4023278,German #1," Ach! I could have fired a V-8!
",3223279,Walt," Those guys normally stink. That's why we play them exclusively.
",6523280,Larry," Those cheaters must've cheated!
",3323281,Walt," Now, Larry. Let's deal with this like mature adults.  Mommy!
",6223282,Mom," What is it, you colicky bastards?!
",3623283,Walt," We were playing video games and the other kids didn't play fair!
",6623284,Mom," What?! Nobody rips off my kids but me! We can find out who they are through their motion-capture camera. It better not be those little Korean girls again. Aha! Got it!
",16923285,Bender,"  Woo! We're the greatest! Mostly me!
",3823286,Mom,"  Bender RodrÃ_guez?
",2023287,Walt,"  But he's a stock MomCorp bending unit.  And 'e's twelve years out-of-date. How could 'e possibly play that well?
",11523288,Bender,"  Did you see me?! History came alive an' I killed it!
",5523289,Cubert,"  If I overclock you some more, maybe we can beat those Korean girls!
",7023290,Mom," Well, well. That nerd burglar overclocked the Robot's processor!
",6623291,Larry," And that voids his warranty. Even an idiot like me knows that.
",6423292,Mom," An idiot like you knows nothing! What matters is... It violates the licence agreement. And that means I've got 'im right by his littleâ€”
",13723293,Smitty," Ding dong. I'm sayin' ""Ding dong"" 'cause you don't 'ave a doorbell.
",6923294,Cubert," Hey, pigs.
",1223295,URL," We're lookin' for a Cubert J. Farnsworth.
",4323296,Cubert," You're porkin' at 'im!
",2423297,Smitty," You're under arrest for felony violation of the MomCorp licence agreement.
",7623298,Farnsworth," What's all this oinking about?! Who called the fuzz?!
",5523299,URL," Sir, who's this boy's legal guardian?
",3923300,Farnsworth," You're porkin' at 'im!
",2423301,URL," Then the charges apply to you too.
",3623302,Farnsworth," Wha?
",623303,Mom," Farnsworth?! What a lucky break!
",3423304,Mom," After all these years, I've got 'im! And legally too!
",5523305,Larry," Even an idiot like me knows he'll be ruined.
",4623306,Mom," An idiot like you is correct!
",3123307,Farnsworth," You overclocked Bender?! What did I teach you about tinkering with machinery?
",7923308,Cubert," How. You taught me how.
",2523309,Farnsworth," I also taught you not to get caught! Oh, I wish I'd never cloned you.
",7123310,Cubert," It's not my fault! I didn't even know Bender had a licence agreement!
",7123311,Farnsworth," Neither did Iâ€” Ooh.
",2123312,Farnsworth," Bender, as my newest employee, could you bend this drinking straw for me?
",7523313,Bender," Sure. Let me just.
",2023314,Mom,"  First, click the licence agreement, deary.
",4523315,Farnsworth," I really shouldn't agree to things I don't understand, but I'm slightly thirsty.
",8223316,Farnsworth," Oh, God! I clicked without reading!
",3723317,Cubert," An' I slightly modified a thing that I own!
",4523318,Farnsworth," We're monsters!
",1723319,Walt," Congratulations, Mother. Can you die happy now?
",4923320,Mom," Not yet!
",1023321,Walt," Darn!
",723322,Mom," I can't rest until this bending unit is restored to factory specs.
",6823323,Igner," Why not?
",1023324,Mom," If people learn they can overclock their old Robots, they won't buy my new Robots! This will not stand!  Hoverfish,  bring me the clock of Bender RodrÃ_guez.
",15823325,Hermes," Good news, everyone! That's what the Professor would say if we weren't in jail facin' a life sentence.
",10423326,Bender," Guys! Guys! I discovered I have an extra processor in my compartment o' mystery. Bein' overclocked was a start, but, once I activate this processor, I'll be all like, ""You're a big dummy, Einstein! Get a haircut!"" Aw! Wow! I can't believe how stupid I used to be an' you still are. What are all these page-y things?
",31723327,Amy," Look out! You're overheating!
",3123328,Bender," Yeah, yeah. There. Now, I'm water-cooled. I can stimulate my intellect without further thermodynamical disruptions.
",11723329,Fry," I miss the old, illiterate Bender.
",3623330,Hermes," What's happened to you, mon? I thought you liked beer an' knock-knock jokes.
",7823331,Bender," I'm processin' so fast, it's like I can anticipate that the ceilin' fan's gonna fall an' knock Zoidberg unconscious.
",11823332,Zoidberg," Wrong, Mr. Genius.
",2023333,Bender," Not that ceilin' fan. In fact, lookin' ahead, it's obvious Mom won't allow me to stay accelerated like this. Hmmm. Who's up for a turkey dinner an' a game o' badminton?
",17023334,Hermes," Say what?!
",1223335,Bender," Yup.
",623336,Amy," Uh-oh. 'E must be overheating again.
",3823337,Hoverfish," Bending unit, you are ordered to report for factory reset.
",6023338,Bender," Okay. Sure. But, first, this.
",3123339,Zoidberg," I hear turkey. Woop-woop-woop-woop-woopâ€” Oh, boy. Ay... Ay. Ay.
",6523340,Bender," Ten more processors for me. Once I install these, I'll have access to the loftiest realms o' thought!
",10323341,Zoidberg," Anyone have access to a lofty realm of gravy?
",4723342,Bender," I can conceive of gravies that would boggle your tiny mind! But it's not safe here. So I'll need to find a hideout.
",11723343,Fry," Hideout? Bender, are you becoming some kinda supervillain?
",6023344,Bender," Farewell, monobrains.
",2323345,Yellow and red lawyer," Your Honour, Mom is a poor, frail industrialist with three special sons who require constant neglect. Yet, isn't it true, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that this boy, this... Cubert Farnsworth...
",20123346,Cubert,"  That's my name. Don't wear it out.
",3723347,Yellow and red lawyer," Deliberately robber her blind by improving his own Robot?!
",6023348,Fishy Joe," It's true! 'E did it!
",2323349,Yellow and red lawyer," No further questions for this jury.
",3723350,Ron Whitey," Before I call a recess for mimosas and horse breeding, can the defence produce the bending unit in question?
",11023351,Farnsworth,"  We don't know where the hell 'e is.
",3823352,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, that is something we cannot a-doodle-do.
",5523353,Ron Whitey," Then I'm holding the defendants in contempt and fining them ten-thousand dollars a day until they produce the Robot.
",11823354,Hermes," Oh! At that rate, Planet Express will be bankrupt in... Four fingers!
",7123355,Hermes," It's been a good run, people, but this is the end.
",5223356,Zoidberg,"  Wait!  I've got it! This building's technically in the theatre district. If we could mount one big musical featuring everyone's talents, we might just save Planet Express!
",17423357,Nibbler," We'll call it Nibbler on the Roof!
",3623358,Fry," Alright!
",1023359,Zoidberg," Hooray!
",923360,Hermes," We're saved!
",1423361,Leela," I've been thinking a lot about moving on with my life. And hearing the words Nibbler on the Roof has given me the kick in the pants I needed. It's time for me to leave and make a fresh start.
",19323362,Fry,"  Don't go, Leela, please. You an' me... We were supposed to...
",6423363,Leela," What?
",723364,Fry," I dunno.  But someday we'll find out.  Won't we?
",5023365,Leela," Goodbye, Fry.
",1523366,Fry," I dunno, Randy. I just feel like my life's falling apart. The Professor's in jail and now Leela's gone forever.
",11323367,Randy Munchnik," Stay strong, Fry.
",1923368,Fry," You're the best friend I have left.  An' I barely even know you.
",6623369,Randy Munchnik," Have you thought about asking Bender for help?
",4823370,Fry,"  What are you, Randy? A complete moron?!  I'd love to talk to Bender, but I 'ave no idea where 'e is.
",10323371,Randy Munchnik," Well, if 'e's runnin' on twelve processors, 'e must be some place with a lotta power and liquid coolant.
",10623372,Fry,"  Aw! You're no help at all!  I'm gonna go kill myself.
",5623373,Fry,"  Wait a second. Power. Liquid coolant.  That gives me the option of electrocution or drowning.
",9623374,Paper-hatted salesman,"  Barrels here.  Can't go over the Falls without a barrel.
",5923375,Fry," What are my chances of surviving in one o' those?
",5123376,Paper-hatted salesman," Slim to none.
",1523377,Fry," I like those odds!
",2023378,Fry,"  Wait. This isn't a barrel. It's just a stinking cask! I want my money  back!  Ow! Ow!
",8823379,Fry," That was not worth three-thousand dollars.
",4423380,Fry," Hello? Anybody?
",1723381,Bender,"  Fry?
",723382,Fry," Bender?! Are you in here?!
",2823383,Bender," In here is the only place I'm not. I amuse myself.
",5223384,Fry," Butâ€” Bender?! What happened to you?
",3723385,Bender," I'll try to put it in terms you can comprehend. I passed the existential singularity.
",8723386,Fry," Try harder!
",1323387,Bender," I hacked myself inside-out and now the entire universe is my processor.
",7323388,Fry," Whoa! I definitely wanna hear about that. But, first, I need your help. The Professor and Cubert are in trouble and Leela left me. I'm in misery!
",14723389,Bender," I've grown far beyond the petty concerns of your world. Every time I burp, a new galaxy is born.  Two if I've been eatin' broccoli. All existence is just a chess game. An' I can see fifty moves ahead. Human emotion no longer concerns me.
",23923390,Fry," Butâ€” But Randy saidâ€”
",2223391,Bender,"  Randy?!  'Ave you been hangin' out with Randy?!
",5023392,Fry," Please, Bender. If everything is a chess game for you, you must know how to help me.
",8623393,Bender," I'm sorry, Fry. But some games you just can't win.  Cubert and the Professor are guilty. The jury will vote to convict.  I can't change that.
",14323394,Fry," Well, what about Leela? Is there any hope things could still work out between us?
",8323395,Bender,"  It's getting late. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some new heavy elements to create.  Better cover your nads. It may get a little non-Newtonian in here.
",15723396,Ron Whitey," Not only have the defendants failed to rebut the charges, they've not even presented any mitigating factors to recommend leniency. It strikes me as an extra-risky strategy.
",17423397,Hyper-Chicken," Did you say ""extra-crispy recipe""?
",3623398,Ron Whitey," You know I didn't.
",2023399,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour... If we could locate Bender RodrÃ_guez, he would testify that my clients acted without malice.
",10823400,Fry," No, 'e wouldn't. Bender doesn't care about us anymore.
",5623401,Zoidberg," Someone used to care about me?! Hooray!
",4123402,Ron Whitey," In that case, the jury will begin its deliberations. Bailiff,  release the jury collies.
",9023403,Mom," I finally nailed Farnsworth. Destroyin' the boy is just icing on the cake.
",7623404,Larry," No one destroys a boy like you, Mother.
",4123405,Mom," Thank you, you repulsive disappointment.
",4223406,Fry," Any word from Leela?
",2223407,Amy," I heard she took a job selling deep-space real estate. Somewhere beyond the most distant thing ever observed with a telescope.
",12823408,Fry,"  She always liked not being observed with a telescope.
",5623409,Ron Whitey," Order. Order in the head.
",2723410,Bender," For reasons beyond even my comprehension, I 'ave returned to testify on behalf of the defendants.
",9923411,Farnsworth," Yay!
",623412,Cubert," Yay, Bender!
",1423413,Fry,"  I knew 'e cared about us!
",2823414,Hermes," You said you knew he didn't care about us!
",4423415,Fry," Leave me alone.
",1723416,Yellow and red lawyer," Your Honour, I object to this surprise witness. 'E's too surprising!
",7023417,Ron Whitey," Sustained. Testimony has closed.
",3423418,Bender," Butâ€” Your Honourâ€”
",1923419,Ron Whitey," Silence! One more in-burst like that an' I'll have this courtroom removed from you! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
",10323420,Bender,"  I'm sorry, guys. I didn't realise I was late. I guess I'm not as smart as everybody thought.
",9523421,Farnsworth," I was born in prison and I'll die in prison.
",4623422,Bender," There is still one hope. You're co-defendants. An' the jury might not wanna convict a twelve-year-old.
",10423423,Mom," Son of a nerd. He may be right! Make sure Farnsworth doesn't get off easy on account o' that snot-gobbling twerp.
",11523424,Ron Whitey," 'As the jury reached a verdict?
",3323425,Fishy Joe," Not just any verdict, Your Honour. A great verdict!
",5323426,Mom,"  They're going to take pity on him!  Do something!
",5223427,Yellow and red lawyer," Your Honour, prosecution moves to drop the charges against Cubert Farnsworth.
",7923428,Ron Whitey," Very well. The case against Cubert Farnsworth is hereby dismissed.
",6823429,Cubert," Told ya I'd get away with it.
",3123430,Ron Whitey," That'll do, pig. Please read the verdict against Professor Farnsworth.
",7223431,Fishy Joe," You got it, Judge. I think you'll find this verdict as fair as it is cruel.
",7723432,Bender,"  Your Honour,  I move for a mistrial on grounds of double jeopardy. Cubert Farnsworth cannot be tried twice for the same crime! Cubert is the Professor's clone. Ergo, they are legally the same person. Since you dismissed the charges against Cubert, you cannot convict the Professor of these same charges!
",30623433,Hyper-Chicken," Well, I'll be a nugget's uncle. He's right!
",4523434,Ron Whitey," What a brilliant legal shenanigan! Case dismissed.
",5223435,Zoidberg," Yay!
",623436,Fry," Yay!
",623437,Hermes," Yes!
",623438,Fry," Bender, you knew all this would happen, didn't you?
",5323439,Bender," Yes. All except this part.
",2823440,Mom," If I can't bring down Farnsworth, I can at least dumb down 'is Robot. Take 'im away and reset 'im to factory-stupid condition!
",12823441,Fry," Bender, wait. While you can still calculate the future, just tell me: What's gonna happen with me an' Leela?
",11023442,Bender," There's no time now. Quick, Zoidberg! Take three steps to your right!
",7123443,Nibbler,"  We've had some tough times,  but at least we won a Tony!
",5923444,Zoidberg," You won a Tony. Feh!
",2223445,Fry," Wow. You gave up your superintelligence to save us. Why did you come back?
",7623446,Bender," Honestly, I couldn't think o' one good reason. But some decisions can't be made by thinking. Even if you're drunk! No galaxies there.
",13523447,Leela," Knock knock.
",1423448,Bender," Oh! Oh! Who's there?!
",2323449,Fry," Leela?!
",923450,Farnsworth," Yay!
",623451,Bender," Leela who?!
",1323452,Fry,"  It's good  to see you.  Is it good to see me?
",4823453,Leela," Of course.
",1223454,Amy,"  Come on in, Leela!  Take that ugly coat off!
",4723455,Leela," Thanks. Hi, everybody.
",2423456,Hermes," So... Tell us. How's the intergalactic real estate going?
",5923457,Leela," Pretty good. I just sold a castle to the King of Space. But, somehow, I keep finding myself thinking about this place. An' things.
",13223458,Fry,"  Things  like me or... Things like this badminton racket?
",5923459,Leela," You, Fry. Bender, while you still have your giant brain, please... Tell me: If Fry an' I ended up togetherâ€”
",10923460,Fry," It's too late, Leela. He's good, old Bender again. 'E's totally useless.
",7423461,Bender," Well, not totally! Before they reset me, I figured out the answers to life's great questions. Uh... This is the reason we exist. This is which ceilin' fans are gonna fall. Aha! Found it! Fry and Leela's Ultimate Fate... By Bender.
",23223462,Fry," Uh, it's probably better if we don't know. Uh, mystery of life and whatnot.
",7723463,Leela," Gimme that!
",1323464,Galactic Entity," A wise man once said that nothing really dies. It just comes back in a new form. Then he died. So, next time you see a lowly salamander, think twice before you step on it. It might be you. Stand by for ""Reincarnation"".
",22023465,Planet Express headquarters," 'Owdy, folks! Come on in!
",2723466,Leela,"  Jumpin' Joe an' golly jeeper,
I got one gigantic peeper.
Sassafras an' banana oil,
I'm a bee-youtiful purple-haired goyl.
",12423467,Bender," Watch it!
",1123468,Fry," Oh, it's just that I love Leela something awful. Do you think a space-age dame like her would ever marry a two-bit, low-life delivery boy like me an' also I 'ave bad posture and severe financial problems?
",20623469,Bender," Have you tried gettin' 'er pregnant?
",3823470,Fry," Gosh, yes. I've tried an' tried, but, so far, I only got Amy pregnant.
",7223471,Bender," You know what your problem is?  Too much smoke in your face.
",6223472,Fry," I wanna ask Leela to marry me, but I can't afford a diamond ring big enough to express my love.
",9723473,Bender," That's for sure.  Not on the measly salary I steal from you each month.
",7323474,Horn loudspeaker," All crew, report to the laboratorium. Get a wiggle on.
",5623475,Fry," Thanks for the heads-up, Sparky.
",3423476,Horn loudspeaker," Mhm. Fish on Friday. An' Human flesh the rest of the week.
",6023477,Farnsworth," Movietone News, everyone.  I've discovered a new comet!
",5723478,Leela," One side, boys. Let a lady take a gander.
",4323479,Farnsworth," Hang on. Let me just adjust it to your eye level.
",5123480,Leela,"  Holy matrimony!  That's one flashy rock!
",4323481,Farnsworth," Indeed. It's pure diamondium!
",3123482,Fry," Um... Would it be possible to break off a piece an' put it in an engagement ring for reasons that are private?
",11223483,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff! Nothing in the universe can fracture diamondium. Not even God 1 an' God 2 put together. But behold!  The tail is composed of abrasive comet powder.  And that's just what I need to put a washday shine on my new Doomsday device.  Now hop in the flivver and score me some o' that sweet, sweet powder.
",30923484,Hermes," Comet ahoy!  Why, it's lit up like a smooth, refreshing Chesterfield.
",7123485,Farnsworth," Get plenty of that powder. I want this bomb to sparkle like the floor at Grand Central Station.  Over and out.
",11223486,Amy," Watch it, ya stumblebums! You're boopin' my betty!
",5223487,Fry," Um... I'll be back in a jiff. I gotta go check this comet for anarchists.
",7523488,Fry," Wouldja look at that gem! Slap that shiner on a ring an' me an' Leela will be doing the married, horizontal Charleston in no time.
",13223489,Fry," Alright, diamond. You won those rounds. But I've got an ace up my hole.
",7323490,Leela," I love this time of day. There's such a beautiful stillness.
",6223491,Fry," Leela, I don't know if words can describe how I feel about youâ€”
",6523492,Leela," Good?
",723493,Fry," Huh. I guess they can. Anyhow, when a guy feels good about 'is sweetheart, 'e wants to prove it by giving 'er somethin' really... Good!
",13723494,Leela," I'm still listenin', you big lug.
",3523495,Fry," What I'm tryin' to say is... In all the world, I couldn't find a diamond good enough for you. But then I found one out there...  Among the stars. The beautiful, affordable stars.
",18023496,Leela," You mean... When you disappeared up on the comet...
",5323497,Fry," Exactly.
",1023498,Leela," I thought you snuck off to take a dump.
",4123499,Fry," A man can sneak off to do two things.
",3923500,Leela," Oh, Fry!
",1023501,Fry," In exactly ten seconds, the Doomsday device will blow the stone loose. An', if my calculations are correct, it will land here on your finger.
",14323502,Leelas finger," You've made me the happiest finger in the whole wide hand!
",6023503,Fry," Comet kaboomination in three, twoâ€”
",3623504,Bird," Uh... Hello?! Cuckoo!
",2323505,Fry," The diamond still didn't break!   Now, you'll never know 'ow much I love you.   It went kersplitters!
",10323506,Leela," Fry, I don't need a diamond. You've given me the most beautiful rainbow I've ever seen! All the colours of the spectrum!
",12223507,Fry,"  Not beautiful enough! A swell gal like you deserves better!
",6223508,Leela,"  What's that?!  Is my eye playing trick on me?!  It's so beautiful! Fry, you've created a new colour! Totally different from any other colour or combination of colours.
",17023509,Fry," Shucks. It's still only half as beautiful as you.  Whoa!
",5823510,Leela," Whoa! I wish this moment could last forever.
",4623511,Fry," Leela, my love, will you marryâ€”
",3323512,Alien,"  Bernilla, my love,  will you marry me?
",4123513,Bernilla," Blorg! Blorg! A thousand times blorg!
",3923514,Bender," Ba-da-ba-da-ba-dip-That's all you get, jerks!
",4723515,Farnsworth," Good news, multiplayers! After a lifetime of toil, I'm on the verge of solving all the mysteries of science!
",11023516,Bender," So we can leave early?
",2423517,Farnsworth," Certainly not!  Not until I demonstrate this new microscope lens,  made from the debris of that diamondium comet.
",11523518,Bender," Eh, Professor.
",1623519,Farnsworth,"  Yes, Bender?
",1523520,Bender," Boo!   Okay. Too bad. Goodbye.
",3223521,Farnsworth," You're not through with this level! I have another lens.
",5823522,Bender,"  Bite my 8-bit metal ass.  That's ""Bite"" with a Y.
",5223523,Hermes," Whatever you say, mon.
",2423524,Farnsworth," Due to the lens' remarkable quark-lattice structure,  it should be capable of unthinkable magnification!  Come.  Follow me to the lab.
",13623525,Bender," Hey, I'm gonna try that! So long, meatbags! Son of aâ€”
",5523526,Farnsworth," Eh, let me just insert  lens in microscope.  There! Now, for the first time, we may be able to see the infinitesimal fabric of matter itself.  Laying bare the most fundamental laws of the universe!
",19923527,Leela,"  Hey, Fry. I know something you could lay bare.
",4923528,Fry,"  Leela! Shhh! I'm tryin' to listen to a physics lecture!
",5823529,Farnsworth,"  Now, to examine some matter. Any old matter will do.
",5523530,Hermes,"  Mon, that's some cheap-ass matter!  What the hell is it?
",5923531,Farnsworth,"  Oh,  it's just a log I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea. Now, to penetrate its deepest mysteries.
",10823532,Leela,"  Hey, Fry.
",1223533,Fry,"  Leela! No means no!
",2223534,Farnsworth," Oh, my! There's a frog on a bump on this log that I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea!
",9523535,Leela," An' that's the ultimate secret of the universe?!
",5023536,Farnsworth," Apparently so. Wait! There's a snail on the tail of the frog on the bump on this log that I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea!
",13523537,Hermes," Dear Eliza!
",1323538,Farnsworth,"  The snail itself is composed of cells, molecules, atoms...
",6123539,Fry," Pfff! Those things don't rhyme!
",3323540,Farnsworth,"  Things only rhyme below ten to the minus five angstroms, you dope!  Now, ions an' pions, muons an' gluons, neutrinos, gravitinos...  We're closing in on the very smallest particles of matter! For the first time, we're about to observe the fundamental structure of the universe.  Such detail.  Such finely wrought intricate beauty!
",33323541,Leela," It's like staring into the face of God!
",4123542,Scruffy," It's a mirror into Scruffy's soul.
",3623543,Farnsworth," This explains everything! Even the Big Bang that created the universe! All that's left is the mathematics! Put down h-bar, uh, carry the infinity, andâ€” My-reka! There it is! The Grand Unified Theory! Reducing all the laws of nature to a single equation!
",25523544,Amy," Professor, you did it! You solved the problem that baffled Einstein an' drove Stephen Hawking to quit physics and become a cartoon voice actor!
",14523545,Stephen Hawkings head," I like physics, but I love cartoons.
",3823546,Farnsworth," This is the greatest moment in scientific history! At last, there are no more questions left to answer!
",10523547,Stephen Hawkings head," Yay!
",623548,Amy," Yay!
",623549,Hermes," Woohoo! Alright! Well done, Professor. Okay. Back to work, everyone.
",7023550,Farnsworth," Wait. There are no more questions left to answer.
",5123551,Farnsworth," Oh.
",523552,Morbo," And those are today's high scores. Linda?
",4323553,Linda," Thanks, Morbo. Coming up next, Galaxians. What you need to know to protect your family.
",8923554,Farnsworth," How do you people do it? How do you go on knowing there's nothing more to know?!
",8223555,Fry," I watch TV. It's the next best thing to bein' alive.
",5423556,Farnsworth," What's the use? I'm just not capable of the happiness of the dumb. If only I'd made some mistake!
",9923557,Stephen Hawkings head," You didn't. I checked the invariance of your Lagrangian. Hubba-hubba.
",7123558,Farnsworth," Then there's nothing left to do! Nothing!
",4323559,Bender," Would it cheer you up if I punched Fry in the groin? 'Cause I'll do it. Regardless. Body blow! Body blow!
",10723560,Farnsworth," I devoted every waking minute to answering the fundamental questions of science.
",8223561,Farnsworth,"  I never married.
",1923562,Farnsworth,"  Rarely went outside!
",2323563,Farnsworth,"  And, now that I've found all the answers, I realise that what I was living for were the questions!
",10123564,Fry," That stinks, Professor. Too bad the universe made it turn out that way and not some other way. I wonder why it did that.
",12223565,Stephen Hawkings head," Probably magnets.
",1923566,Farnsworth," Shut up, Hawking. Fry, you idiot!  You're a genius! Why are the laws of physics what they are? Instead of some other laws? To find out, we'd have to recreate the conditions before the Big Bang. It would take decades of work by thousands of scientists in a particle accelerator powered by dump trucks of flaming grant money.  Of course, there'd be no guarantee of success.  And, in any case, I'd never live to see it.
",41823567,Leela," I'm surprised you lived through that sentence.
",4823568,Hermes," Sorry you wasted your life, Professor. I guess you never know everything after all.
",8523569,Farnsworth," Indeed. The pursuit of knowledge is hopeless and eternal.  Hooray!
",6823570,Amy,"  Yay!
",723571,Hermes,"  Yeah-heah!
",1323572,Bender,"  Woohoo! Alright! Yay!
",2423573,Farnsworth,"  Action Delivery Force, assemble!
",3523574,Bender,"  And me, Mighty Merchandise Robot!
",3623575,Transition Announcer #1,"  Meanwhile, on Space Planet 4, the Aliens who communicate by dancing...
",7323576,Transition Announcer #1,"  Were worshipping a giant comet.
",3423577,Subtitle," All hail great comet! Beloved mascot of popular shrimp crunch snack! Also God. Foreigners killed our God! Many words of disapproval!
",13423578,Leela,"  Team assembled!  What is that box, you old witch?
",5223579,Farnsworth," Ha ha ha! I'll never tell you.  It's a deep space-emotion detector.  The detector can tell you're impressed. You should be!  Wha? The marvellous device. It's detecting a massive burst of anger. From deep space!
",21223580,Subtitle," There is Earth! Attack it as previously discussed!
",5223581,Fry," Flying bananas? Ha ha! I will slice them on my morning fish porridge.
",7123582,Farnsworth," This is no time for one of your jokes, Fry.
",4523583,Fry," I will tell you something that's no joke.  I will lead the defence fight.
",7523584,Farnsworth," Ha ha ha ha! Don't make me laugh. If we fight, we'll surely be destroyed.
",7523585,Hermes," Then what is our only hope?!
",3023586,Amy," We must summon Zagtar, defender of space!
",4323587,Hermes," You forget!
",1323588,Hermes,"  Zagtar was destroyed by the crystal space devil!
",5123589,Leela,"  The crystal space devil was once my brother, Prince Hiroshi.
",6323590,Leela,"  I mourn his loss. But what matters now is protecting Earth from that fruit armada.
",8523591,Farnsworth," I see your mother, the water Mutant, didn't raise any fools, Turanga Leela. Our only hope is to communicate with the Aliens. And show them our peaceful intentions.
",16523592,Bender," Perhaps they speak perfect English... As do we.
",4923593,Farnsworth," We can't take that chance! We'll need my universal auto-translator!
",6923594,Farnsworth,"  This  is my universal auto-translator!
",4123595,Fry," That will show them our peaceful intentions.
",4623596,Farnsworth," The only question is, ""Who should  be our spokesman?!""
",5623597,Zoidberg," Me! Me! Choose Zoidberg.
",2623598,Fry," Zoidberg, a diplomat? The list of things I've heard now contains everything.
",7823599,Zoidberg," Hear my words. My shell may be tough like a samurai honeymoon mask, but inside I'm as soft and sensitive as a girl made of custard!
",13323600,Cubert,"  Custard time?!  Hooray!
",2623601,Zoidberg," Please! I am certain I will succeed with my delicate manner. Oops.
",6823602,Leela," Instead, I will send the peace transmission. Most honoured visitors, we greet you in peace.
",9323603,Subtitle," Why does it flap its face hole? I am puzzled, for we don't know what mouths are. It's a threat! Destruct them!
",11223604,Hattie McDoogal," Kajigeru desu!
",1623605,Farnsworth," All attempts to communicate with the Aliens have failed. I fear our only option is thrilling space battle.
",10823606,Bender and Fry," Power friends, go!
",2023607,Male voice," Launch all missiles! Launch all missiles!
",4323608,Farnsworth," We were defeated in battle.
",2923609,Bender,"  Oh, no! They're forming Gigatron!
",3623610,Farnsworth," Defeat is ours. If we can't communicate with these bone-jelly ghosts, we're doomed!
",8523611,Amy," Professor, I 'ave analysed the Aliens' movements with this movement analyser.
",7923612,Farnsworth," That device was a gift from my ancestors. Go on.
",5023613,Amy," It seems their movements are a form of language. Rather than speaking Jaâ€”
",7523614,Transition Announcer #1," English!
",1023615,Amy,"  Like us, they speak by dancing.
",3423616,Farnsworth," Of course! Having no mouths our ears, they could only communicate through motions!
",8423617,Fry," Or perhaps by odours!
",2323618,Bender," That is 'ow you communicate!
",3023619,"Amy, Leela, Fry, Bender, and Hermes"," Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
",2323620,Leela," Then our only hope to talk to them is by doing a peace dance. But it will have to be smoother an' more fluid than any movement mankind is capable of.
",15123621,Fry," What if we hire a buttered geisha?
",3623622,Farnsworth," Another one of your ill-timed jokes, Fry?!
",4423623,Fry," You an' I are enemies now!
",2823624,Zoidberg," Hear my words. I believe I, the most humble member of Action Delivery Team, could do such a dance!
",10023625,Hermes," Surely, your heart shell is too rigid! I call on anyone but you to do the peace dance!
",8823626,Zoidberg,"  Aw.
",623627,Bender," Of course, I will do the peace dance. But I will need 'elp.
",6123628,Bender and Fry," Super Dance Squad, initiate!
",3023629,Amy," We all hope they're communicating a peaceful message!
",5523630,Subtitle," Hey Aliens, we will kill you! And dishonor your widows by making them gather wood! Fire a the weapon!
",10323631,Farnsworth," Wha, wha?! We thought we were so smart with our science and dancing, but look at us now: At Gigatron's mercy!
",11123632,Zoidberg," The shame is too great. It's time to end this! Huh-yah! Feh!
",6223633,Leela,"  Zoidberg,  stop! We are too scared right now to enjoy the ceremony of your death!
",8423634,Zoidberg," No hara-kiri today, but heiwa no dansu! The gelatinous dance of peace!
",7223635,Hermes," You may be gelatinous, but not even the Mochi Phanton could perform such intricate motions!
",9323636,Zoidberg," Says you, salaryman!
",2223637,Subtitle," What is the medical crab doing?
",3323638,Zoidberg," Behold! The dance of peace!
",2923639,Bender," The dance is so complex! The eye can barely follow it!
",5623640,Zoidberg," I may be the humblest Team member, but I have given it my all.
",6423641,Amy," I underestimated you, medical crab. But will the Aliens understand?!
",7023642,Subtitle," We have understand peace.
",2723643,Subtitle," Farewell, Action Team.
",2423644,Farnsworth," Zoidberg, you are the greatest hero. You saved us all.
",5623645,Zoidberg," For now. But another threat from the stars is sure to arise next week at the same time!
",8923646,Leela," Until then...
",1523647,Bender and Fry," Action Delivery Force star-hero rocket engage!
",4823648,Farnsworth,"  Planet Express crew, report to headquarters immediately! Repeat: what I just said, immediately!!
",9923649,Amy,"  Sorry, Randy.  Step away from the car and no one gets hurt!
",6223650,Zoidberg," To the employment cave!
",2523651,Hermes," Thanks, dear. Off to work.
",2823652,Scruffy,"  Hyah! Hyah!
",1423653,Scruffy," Ho! Hold it, girl!  G'on now. Gid on back ta Paraguay.
",5623654,Fry," We're bein' eaten by a giant spider!
",3823655,Leela," There's no time for that! The Professor needs us!
",5123656,Farnsworth," Ih, crew,  as you know, I've delivered a lot of good news in the past. But what I'm about to lay down is, by far, the greatest announcement in the history of Planet Express!
",17523657,Fry," What is it? I'm on the edge of my butt!
",4123658,Farnsworth," Ladies and gentlemen,  feast your eyes on our amazing new...  soda machine!
",7723659,Zoidberg," You undersold it, Professor!
",3023660,Fry,"  Look, it has Slurm Loco! It's the extremeiest!
",4923661,Soda Machine," Hey, what can I get y'all?
",2823662,Fry," Wow! You can talk?  Shut up and give me a Slurm Loco!
",5523663,Bender," Ooh ooh! Hey, drink machine, what kind of alcoholic sodas you got?
",6823664,Soda Machine," Y'all can't drink at work! This ain't a saw mill!
",5123665,Bender," No alcohol?! Pfft, an' you got the nerve to call yourself a beverage machine?!
",8023666,Soda Machine," I call myself ""Bev"". An' if you're lookin' for a smelly ol' can o' booze, go look in the mirror!
",9823667,Fry," Oh, snap!
",1123668,Bender," Woooohâ€”
",923669,Hermes," No, now, everybody, calm down.
",3223670,Fry,"  Yeah, I need one more Slurm.  And one more to wash that Slurm taste outta my mouth. 
",8723671,Fry," So I went to the bathroom an' my pee was green.  Pretty neat, huh?
",6823672,Hermes," I was wondering who Shrek'd in the toilet.
",4423673,Bender," I hope you're proud o' yourself, Bev!  You've turned this perfectly worthless loser into an addict!
",10123674,Bev," Cut me some slack, preacher!  I'm just a cold grinder's daughter tryin' ta stay off the pole.
",9523675,Bender," With that big ol' caboose, it'd hafta be a telephone pole!  Hey-Yo! 
",7023676,Bev," Well, I guess a fella's gotta talk big when he's sportin' a little shriveled-up antenna like that.
",10023677,Bender," What?! Youâ€”ihâ€”For your information, ""madam"", it's a grower, not a show-er!
",7623678,Bender," My antenna's fine! It's just fine! Ladies can't get enough Bender!
",6823679,Esther,"  I need to loosen up. Gimme a screwdriver.
",4423680,Bender," Helloooooo! Who's your half-dumb friend?
",4223681,Ruth and Esther," Me.
",523682,Bender," Sure, why not?
",1623683,Esther," Hang on. It's too bright in here. Call me old-fashioned, but I like a little romance in an orgy.
",9823684,Ruth," Let's switch off this weird light.
",3623685,Fry,"  Yow!
",723686,Bender,"  Fry, it's two a.m.!  What're ya doin' here glowin' on my skanks?
",6723687,Fry,"  Just sittin' here turnin' quarters into urine. 
",5023688,Ruth,"  We don't gotta put up with this! We got polyside degrees.
",6023689,Bender," Woah woah woah! Hang on!  I'll just politely escort him in the gutter!
",7223690,Bender," Scram, shiny!
",1523691,Bender," All right! How we feelin'?
",2823692,Ruth," Hot. I could bake a potato in my cleavage.
",4423693,Esther," Yeah, I need a seltzer.
",2523694,Bender,"  I'd be honored to purchase you some refreshment.  Uh, hey, drink machine, ya got anything classy for these delicate flowers?
",12723695,Bev," I ain't makin' drinks for no trashy robosluts!
",4823696,Esther," Trashy? At least I don't put out for quarters!
",4823697,Esther," Hey!
",623698,Bender,"  Hey! Stop that...drink machine! Stop it, I say!
",5023699,Esther," That's it! We're outta here!
",3023700,Ruth," C'mon. We'll split a blintz.
",3023701,Bender," Wait! Gimme a chance to defend your honor. And then sell it to you on the couch!
",8223702,Bender," All right. I've been waitin' all day for an excuse to hit a lady! 
",6823703,Bev," You try it and I'll bash yo' face in!
",3923704,Bender," Ooh! I'm so scared...no-arms!
",3123705,Bev," Want some of this? 
",2123706,Bender," Interesting!
",1423707,Leela," Uh, Fry, you're glowing like the Human Torch on prom night.
",6123708,Amy," Shouldn't you be standing on a rocky coast somewhere preventing shipwrecks?
",7723709,Fry,"  Nice! Hate me because of the brightness of my skin!
",5423710,Fry," You okay, ma'am? I think your soda water broke.
",4923711,Fry," My God! Bev just had a baby in my cup!
",4023712,Fry," I know, right?
",1623713,Leela," I better take that.  Aw, he's so cute.   Wait, no he isn't.
",6123714,Leela," He looks like Bender!
",2323715,Bender," Oh, no no no! No way am I that kid's dad!
",4323716,Baby," Wipe my tiny metal ass!
",2523717,Bender," Ah, crap.
",1123718,Baby," Mama, thirsty!
",1623719,Bev," Hang on, dumplin'. My milk's comin' in.
",4123720,Zoidberg," Uch! In public?!
",1823721,Bender," Ah, biscuits! I'm a father?! How did this happen?!!
",5323722,Bev,"  Does this ring a bell?
",2523723,Bender," Are you tellin' me the stuff we did in private and also twice on the sidewalk made a baby robot? How?!
",10423724,Amy," Aw, Bender, didn't your mom ever tell you where robot babies come from?
",7323725,Bender," No. She was a religious fundamentalist. Plus she didn't have a mouth. It's an unusual combination.
",10023726,Farnsworth," Come on, everyone. Let's take Bender to the teen center to learn about the bots and the bees.
",9523727,Leela," It's okay, Bender. No one here will laugh at you for not knowing where robot babies come from.
",9623728,Tinny Tim," We don't know, either.
",2423729,Farnsworth,"  Then prepare to be embarrassed.
",3423730,Narrator,"  SEX ED. VOLUME ONE or PANTS FULL of SHAME!
",4523731,Narrator," Meet Gerald, a maturing young robot.
",3823732,Spotty Teen Robot #1," Hey, he looks like me!
",2423733,Narrator," His hideous appearance is a byproduct of his hardware gearing up for an important mission: reproduction.
",10623734,Fat-bot," Oh boy oh boy oh boy!
",2323735,Narrator," Since factories can't manufacture enough robots to meet demand, robots can also reproduce by mating.
",10223736,Bender," Aw, now you tell me!
",2223737,Narrator," First, Gerald must find a female robot. The best he can do is Francine.
",7323738,Narrator," After beer and hot wings at a local gas station, the two enjoy intimate time behind a dumpster. It's all perfectly natural. Let's watch, aroused, as Gerald's antenna uploads a binary file to Francine's internal drive.
",21923739,Narrator," Manufacturing specs from each parent are then merged by a randomized algorithm and the resulting code guides assembly of a new robot.  Yes, everything your body does is perfectly natural.
",18923740,Narrator," Except masturbation! That's...just...wrong!!!
",4723741,Bender," Daaaw, I can't believe I made a kid! I'm not ready! There's so much in the world I haven't stolen yet!
",10423742,Leela," Relax, Bender. No one would let you near a child. Bev will get custody and you'll be a deadbeat dad who never even bothers to know his own son.
",14523743,Bender,"  You really think so?
",2323744,Leela," I know so. You're absolutely horrible in every way.
",5323745,Bender,"  You're sweet, Leela.
",2323746,Bender," Sorry, Bev, but I ain't cut out for fatherhood.  So here's my certificate of abandonment drawn up by our notary.
",11423747,Scruffy," That'll be ten bucks.
",2323748,Bender," Now take your kid an' hit the soup line! 
",4323749,Bev," Oh, no, you don't, mister! Damn baby's drivin' me crazy!  He won't stop giggling no matter how much I scream at 'im! 
",11923750,Fry,"  There, there. 
",1723751,Bev," I still got womanly needs! Who's gonna look twice at me with this dirty leash hangin' off my dairy nozzle?
",10823752,Bender,"  Well, not me, that's for sure!
",3323753,Bev,"  Then it's settled!  He's all yours, pappy!
",4523754,Bender," Hey, wait! You can't leâ€” Wha?
",3123755,Bender," What thâ€”?! Ah, can't I have one moment to myself?!! 
",5423756,Bender," Why can't you sleep?
",2223757,Fry," I left my window open and moths got in.
",4123758,Bender," I swear if I wasn't such a great dad, I'd grab his ugly little neck andâ€” 
",7523759,Bender," Hey, he stopped screamin' for a second.
",4123760,Fry," Bend some other stuff!
",2423761,Benders Son," Bend! Bend!
",1323762,Bender," He loves bending! Just like me!  Aw!  I'm gonna call 'im Ben.  After the first half of me, Bender!  That's my bastard!
",12023763,Bender," Uh-oh.
",823764,Ben,"  Bend it, daddy!  Bend it like it called you poo-poo face!
",6023765,Bender,"  It called me what?!?  Ooooh!  God damn!
",4223766,Ben,"  Yay!  You bended it like a p'etzel!
",3823767,Bender,"  Okay.  Now, you.
",1923768,Ben,"  I can't do it!
",1723769,Bender,"  Eh, buddy.  You're learnin'.  You'll get there.
",5023770,Leela,"  Bender, I was wrong.  You're a fine parent and I want to apologiâ€”
",6823771,Bender and Ben,"  Leela was wrong!  Leela was wrong! 
",3823772,Ben,"  Daddy, how'd you get so good at bending?
",4323773,Bender,"  I inherited my arm-control software from my mom.  That's how it's passed down.  Mother to son.
",9723774,Ben,"  But...my mommy had no arms.  Does that mean I can never be a bender?
",7123775,Bender,"  Well, sure you can.  You just need to get a bending card installed.
",7023776,Farnsworth,"   I hate to crush a boy's dreams, but...    What the heck!    He has only one expansion slot and it holds his memory card.  This Robot will never bend!
",15323777,Bender,"  Don't tell my son what he can an' can't do!  You may know what's in his head,  but you don't know what's in his heart!
",12123778,Farnsworth,"  There's no slot in there either.
",3523779,Bender,"  I said ""shut up""!
",2023780,Reverend Preacherbot," Today marks young Ben's thirteenth day of bein' left on contin-yussly! So, b'fo the lawd at this congregation, we upgrade him to manhoodbot! Can I get a ""mazl tov""?
",16623781,"Leela, Bender, Hermes, Farnsworth, Amyand Zoidberg"," Mazl tov!
",1123782,Fry,"  Mazl tov!
",1223783,Ben," I'd like to thank the Preacherbot for the introduction and also for not circumcising me again. Am I right?  Twice was enough. But seriously, today, I'm not just a manbot, I'm the luckiest manbot alive. My mom may have abandoned me, but I have the greatest dad in the whole universe. He's patient, he's not afraid to show his emotions....
",33923784,Bender,"  Don't look at me!
",2023785,Ben," ...and someday, if my dreams come true, I'll be a bender, just like him.
",7423786,Hermes," You must be so proud of your boy.
",3523787,Bender,"  I can take 'im or leave 'im.
",3123788,Bev," I'm back for my son! I've come to take him and leave with him!
",6423789,Hermes,"  She beat you to both things!
",3123790,Bev," It's okay, son. Mama's here now.
",3423791,Ben," Daddy, don't let 'er take me!
",3123792,Bender," Get your lack o' hands off my boy! You're an unfit parent who abandoned her child!
",8423793,Bev," Oh, yeah? Well, I'm still less unfitter than you!
",5123794,Bender," Sez hoo?!
",1123795,Bev," Sez this document you gave me when you tried to abandon Ben first.
",6823796,Scruffy," It's genuine.
",1523797,Bender," That doesn't prove I'm an unfit parent! I was drunk and violent when I signed that!
",8523798,Bev," Well, I'm drunk and violent now! He's comin' with me!
",5523799,Ben," DADDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!
",2323800,Bender,"  SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!
",3123801,Bender," My boy's gone! All I have left to remember him are these innocent playthings we stole together.  Fry, put these someplace safe. 
",13023802,Hermes," That's it, Fry! For a guy who's not too bright, you're too damn bright!
",7323803,Farnsworth," Now get out!! And don't come back until someone finds a use for a million watt idiot!
",8723804,Ben," Mom, will I ever get to see Dad again?
",4023805,Bev," No, he died yesterday. Rust monsters ate his face. Sweet dreams.
",6623806,Bender,"  Psst, quit whimperin' or ya don't get kidnapped!
",5123807,Ben," Dad!
",623808,Bender," Come on! Let's run for it!
",2823809,Ben," What's gonna happen to us now, Dad?
",3723810,Bender," Well, I reckon we'll just sit around this campfire a while.
",6123811,Ben," But then what?
",1623812,Bender," Only a fool plans more than a few centuries ahead, son.
",5723813,URL,"  Freeze, camp woodsmen!
",2523814,Smitty," You're under arrest for kidnapping and burning raccoons without a permit!
",7523815,Ben," It's over, Dad!
",1723816,Bender," It ain't over! I can't outrun a hovercopter, but I can outbend it!
",6823817,Bender," I know, let's outrun it!  There's a dam!
",4223818,Ben," Damn!
",723819,Bender," There's a grate!
",1823820,Ben," Great!
",823821,Bender," But I can't bend anything with my arms agonizingly maimed like this!
",7023822,Ben," Well, maybe I can!
",2023823,Bender," You can do it, son!
",2123824,URL," Yeah, this ain't gon' happen.
",3123825,Bender," Is that even necessary?
",2523826,Ben," I'm sorry, Daddy.
",1923827,Bender," You got nothin' to be sorry about.
",3623828,Leela,"  He's really a very good father.
",3423829,URL," Alright. I got her statement.  And a straight-up grape soda.  Aw, yeah.
",7323830,Bev," I promise things'll be different, son. From now on, I'm chainin' you to a radiator!
",8523831,Leela," I'm amazed someone who dispenses such warm soda could be so cold-hearted!  I'm gonna buy a drink just so I can throw it in your face!  It's another soda baby!
",16023832,URL," Damn!
",723833,Leela," You got knocked up by a police officer while he was looking for your kidnapped child?!
",8823834,Bev," Sure did! I still got it!
",2723835,Bender," So now what happens?
",2223836,Bev," Tell you what, you keep the big one. Long as I got a baby to neglect, I'm happy.
",8223837,Leela," Should we call child services?
",3223838,URL,"  Naw, let's get outta here.
",2923839,Bender," WOOOOOO-OOOO!  WOOO! WOO-HOO-HOO!  Woo?
",4123840,Ben," Sorry, Dad. I'm glad to be back. I'm just kinda bummed I can't bend stuff. All I ever wanted was to go to Bending State, Santa Cruz. But that's never gonna happen.
",16523841,Bender," Listen, you need somethin' bent, you come to me, huh, champ?
",6223842,Bender," Dammit! I love that little guy so much! I'd sacrifice any four of you if it would help him bend even a little!
",11223843,Farnsworth," There is one way!  Eh, but, no. It's too horrible!
",5223844,Bender," Nothing's too horrible for my boy!
",3623845,Farnsworth," Well, I could install a bending card.
",3923846,Bender," But you said he only has one slot!
",3623847,Farnsworth," Correct! I'd have to remove his memory card! He'd be able to bend, but he'd lose all his memories! He wouldn't even remember who you are!
",13923848,Bender," You sure you wanna be a bender, son?
",3823849,Ben," More than anything.
",2123850,Bender," Just remember, your daddy loves you. Remember that, will you, son? Remember that! 
",8423851,Ben," Dad, are you crying?
",2223852,Bender," ""No,"" I said with the mouth you're lookin' at.
",4823853,Bender,"  You sure take after your old man.
",3623854,Ben," I never knew my father.
",2523855,Bender,"  Ooooh, it's not important. What is important is that we get you to Bending State Santa Cruz in time for registration!
",12023856,Zoidberg," Then we better hurry!  Registration ends in one hour!
",5523857,Bender," To the ship!
",1423858,Leela," It's too foggy! We can't navigate through this storm! Our lights aren't bright enough.
",8823859,Bender," I'm sorry I let you down, son.
",3223860,Ben," Who are you again?
",2023861,Bender," It's just not possible to get you to bending school this year.
",6423862,Fry," Or is there?!
",1523863,Fry," Merry College Registration Day, everyone!
",4323864,Leela," A lot of weather we're having.
",3223865,Fry," Allow me, m'lady.  Shall we go a-trousering?
",4623866,Leela," Fry, I appreciate the gallantry, but isn't this a bit much?
",6123867,Fry,"  You're right. I'm sorry for showing my love.
",4723868,Leela,"  Okay. Fine.
",1423869,Fry," Here, take my hand!
",2123870,Farnsworth," News and weather, everyone. I'm sure you've all noticed the bizarre atmospheric conditions of late.
",10123871,Hermes," Come to mention it, yes.
",2623872,Farnsworth," It seems something ain't right in the magnetosphere, so I'm launching this high-altitude weather balloon to gather more data.
",12723873,Fry," My pants! My lucky pants!
",2723874,Hermes," They don't look so lucky to me.
",3323875,Fry," They are too! I was wearing them that time I found a dime in my ear! It was wearing them when I won a subscription to Redbook! And I was wearing them when I first met Leela, so, yeah, they're lucky!
",20023876,Leela," Aw...also, oh, Lord.
",2223877,Fry," Plus, they're my only pants.
",3023878,Bender," You've worn the same pants for a thousand years? No wonder they made a run for it!  Woo!
",9023879,Farnsworth," Soon your trousers will slip the surly bonds of Earth, and ascend to the heavens!
",8323880,Fry," I'm gonna blast that balloon!  No way will I let God get my pants!  Nobody messes with my pants. Not even the Holy One. Blessed be He. 
",13723881,Hermes," Look out! A Central Park badger!
",3423882,Fry," I'll save you, pants! Scruffy, do you have any varmint grease?
",6423883,Scruffy," What viscosity you need?
",2623884,Fry," Woah, there's writing in here!  Also, this grease is flammable!
",6523885,Farnsworth," Incredible! Who could have done this? The sewer mutants?
",5823886,Leela," No, this isn't mutant language. We use a lot more profanity.  Son of a biâ€“!
",7723887,Fry," Leela! Take my hand!
",2223888,Leela," I'm slipping! The one time your hands aren't sticky, they're greasy!
",7023889,Fry," I'm sorry. Normally, I would have wiped them on my pants, butâ€“
",6423890,Fry," Are you okay?
",1523891,Leela," Iâ€“ow! My leg! It's broken! How'd you get down here?
",5323892,Fry," We made a rope from my shirt and jacket.  And an expedition flag from my underpants!  I'll help you up. Here, take my hand.
",12523893,Leela," Stop telling me to take your hand! Look, Fry, your noble things keep making things worse. Can't you just be a rude, unhelpful jerk like Bender?
",14523894,Bender," When I use up the toilet paper I don't put up a new roll!
",5923895,Zoidberg," Fry, my friend, I found your pants!  And no sign of that crafty badger!
",7323896,Fry," All right! Lucky pants! 
",2623897,Amy," Oh my God! Look what my flashlight found!
",4323898,Zoidberg," A giant pyramid under New New York? What badger could have built this?
",7223899,Farnsworth," And look at this intricately carved disk! It merits years of study. But how can we move such a fragile, preciousâ€“
",11523900,Bender," Ancient history coming through! 
",3423901,Farnsworth," Amazing! It appears to be some kind of extremely ancient calendar! Predating even the girls of Sumeria! Of course! It's a Mayan calendar!  No...wait! There's some dried-up old stew on the screen.
Scruffy: Sorry. I was eating a can of breakfast and looking at porn.
",26623902,Amy,"  It's not Mayan, it's Martian!
",3223903,Leela," Amy, you grew up on Mars, right? Can you read Martian?
",5623904,Amy," A little. I only learned enough to yell at my nanny. Let's see...  I think it means...""The sun will erupt...all shall perish. Blah, blah, blah.""
",14623905,Bender," Get to the point! What does it say about me, Bender?
",5423906,Amy,"  Nothing! But it does say a great cataclysm will destroy the world in the year thirty twelve! 
",9623907,Bender," The world? That's where I live! Told you it'd say something about me!
",7123908,Fry," So the world will end in three thousand twelve. Why does that year sound so familiar?
",8723909,Farnsworth," Because that's the year that's this year! See?
",4823910,Scruffy,"  So, uh...are you all done with the computer?
",4723911,Hermes," Is it just me - or is the world endin' more often these days?
",6323912,Amy," The calendar predicts fires, earthquakes, sharksplosions...  Then, it just ends!
",8223913,Farnsworth," Exactly as the weather balloon foretold! Before Fry blew his pants outta the sky, it detected the onset of a catastrophic sunspot cycle.  It's starting!  This is the end of the world!
",18523914,Super Hero," Cowardman, away!
",1823915,Nine," Some of us were crazy before it was cool.
",4323916,Leela," Evacuating the planet in 3...2...
",3523917,Farnsworth," So long, Earth! Thanks for nothing!
",3723918,Leela," It's not starting!
",2023919,Sal," Come on...comes on!
",2123920,Nixon," Oh, let me try, headless clone of Agnew!  Damn thing just won't turn over. It's like Pat on a Sunday morning!
",11123921,Farnsworth," Oh, the Marconi is on the fritz too! The electromagnetic storm is disabling all electronics on Earth!
",10323922,Bender,"  Hi, there. 
",1423923,Leela," Well, it wasn't a bad life. If only I could get back that time I spent watching Tron Legacy.
",9423924,Fry," Leela, I've made up my mind. Before we die, I'm gonna find and destroy every remaining copy of Tron Legacy! It may take a couple of hours, butâ€“
",14523925,Leela," Fry, stop trying to do things for me!  Whatever time we have left, just live it with me. So...you wanna join the balcony club?
",12823926,Zoidberg," The balcony club? I have an individual membership!
",5223927,Fry," Zoidberg, get lost!
",2123928,Zoidberg," I am lost! So long.
",2123929,Amy," Stop the end-of-the-world sex! We might survive after all!
",6023930,Farnsworth," Alright, Amy! What's so important that you interrupted my embalming?
",7023931,Amy," I translated more Martian symbols! There's a way off this planet! That underground pyramid isn't a pyramidâ€“  It's a rocketship!
",12923932,Zoidberg," It was worth waiting five hours to hear you finish that sentence.
",6723933,Fry," A spaceship made of stone? With no electronics, it just might work!
",6923934,Bender," I'll stick with wind-up power, thank you very much! 
",5423935,Leela," Hmmm...I've never flown a pyramid before. But I used to drive around town in a mausoleum!
",9123936,Hermes," How many people can this thing carry?
",3923937,Leela," Well, the mausoleum held ten horny teenagers, so...maybe thirty-thousand.
",7523938,Farnsworth," It's our moral duty to save as many lives as possible!  They had a chance! Let's go! 
",8723939,Zapp," Mind if I appear? 
",2023940,Nixon," Welcome to the hidey house. Brannigan! Tell me about this freaky-deaky escape pyramid!
",8823941,Zapp," I can fly it, sir! I just need to know where. And how.
",5623942,Nixon," The obvious destination is Mars.  It's close, with lots of open space and no Woodward or Bernstein! That's a plus. 
",11723943,Amy," But we can only save thirty-thousand people! How do we choose who goes?
",7323944,Nixon," Well, let's see now. We'll need leaders...  scientists...  doctors...  bureaucrats...  pilots...  valuable appliances...  even janitors!  But that's it!  No one else! 
",16923945,Fry," I'll miss you, Leela.  But it's okay. Because then I'll die.
",6223946,Nixon," Cut the waterworks, hippie! The final decision will be made not by me, but by a cold, logical machine!
",10423947,Announcer #1," Who shall live and who shall die? Step right up to the Contrabulous Choosematron!
",8323948,Fry," I hate waiting in line to die.
",3223949,Announcer #1," Move it along, grandma! Stick your hand in and take your chances!
",6723950,Contrabulous Choosematron," Female. Crotchety. Needed to keep others in their place. Accepted! 
",6923951,Hattie McDoogal,"  Damn straight, kajigger!
",2723952,Petunia," Ooh, me next!
",1523953,Contrabulous Choosematron," We just got one of these. Rejected! 
",3823954,Contrabulous Choosematron," Male. Scientist. Fond of crazy contraptions. Accepted! 
",5723955,Contrabulous Choosematron," Female. Scientist. We were in the same sorority! Accepted! 
",6123956,Amyand the Contrabulous Choosematron,"  Sigma beta, see ya later!
",2823957,Contrabulous Choosematron," Male. Medical doctor. Delicious with butter and lemon. Accepted! 
",6723958,Hermes," I wish they'd hurry. I want to get out of here before the mayhem starts!
",7423959,Bender," Mayhem? There's gonna be mayhem? I'm staying!  Woo-eee!
",5723960,Fry," Well, might as well get it over with. 
",4023961,Contrabulous Choosematron," Male. Delivery boy. No discernible skills. Accepted!  'Cause I like his pants.
",8023962,Fry," Yes! My lucky pants! Leela! We can go together after all! Come on, get your badge! Take my hand!
",9823963,Contrabulous Choosematron," Top gun pilot. Natural leader. Extreme combat training. Rejected! 
",6823964,Leela," What?!
",823965,Contrabulous Choosematron," With all spaceships inoperable, we only need one spaceship pilot!
",6723966,Zapp," Wonder what this doo-cracky does.  Snake door. Roger!
",5523967,Fry," You can't reject Leela! Give her a badge, you stupid box! 
",6023968,Contrabulous Choosematron," Male. Filthy hand. Violent temper. Accepted again! 
",5323969,Fry," Nooo!
",723970,Leela," Fry. The box has spoken. Go to Mars.
",3823971,Fry,"  Okay.  Will you at least keep this photo?  Remember how Bender dumped all that pig's blood on me?
",10023972,Leela,"  You keep it. I'll remember you in here. 
",4323973,Fry,"  I wish I could remember with my boobs.
",4123974,Farnsworth," Leela! We're off to Mars!  We'll see ourselves out.
",5323975,Fry," Wait! I did it. I got a Leela a ticket! 
",4223976,Leela,"  How did you that?! 
",2223977,Fry," A-ah-uh-uh! A magician never reveals his secrets. Except the Great Reveal-o!
",7823978,Zoidberg," That guy stinks.
",1823979,Nixon," I still don't see why you get the window seat.
",4823980,Zapp," Folks, this is your captain. Our snake tanks are fully loaded.  So once I figure out which button launches thisâ€“  I figured it out!
",13323981,Bender," Boo! Don't come back! Well, let's get lootin'! 
",4923982,Leela," Fry, this is the most noble thing anyone has ever done for me.  Wait! Fry?
",7623983,Nine," I'm a lot of people, but I'm not Fry! 
",4023984,Leela," Oh, no!
",923985,Leo," Welcome to Mars! It is with heavy heart and open arms that we receive Earth's only survivors! Admission: twenty dollar.
",12123986,Amy," Dad! Gleesh!
",1423987,Zapp," Greetings, Marsmen!  We come to your planet to construct a gleaming city! A second Earth on which to begin anew!
",11423988,Mrs. Wong," Okay! Admission: twenty dollar!
",3323989,Leela," I can't believe it. Fry sacrificed his spot for me and I never even had a chance to thank him.
",9623990,Zoidberg,"  Don't worry, Leela! Earth is still there. Peaceful and serene as ever.
",7323991,Fry," Bender! You're stealing your own stuff!
",4123992,Bender," I am?  Jeez, I better slow down! I'm stealing stuff I don't even need!  You want a Torah?
",9123993,Fry," Nah, I'm not hungry.
",2223994,Bender," Aw, what's the matter? Scared of dying? 
",4223995,Fry," No. 'Cause as long as Leela lives, I'll be alive too. In her heart. But really I'll be dead!
",9423996,Nixon," Ladies and gentlemen. Our new Martian city is complete! I give you...  Dick Francisco!
",8823997,Great Reveal-o," The doves didn't magically spring from my hand, but rather were crammed into this netting sewn into my sleeve!
",11223998,Zapp," Thank you, Great Reveal-o! And now, as a solemn testicle to those left behind on Earth, I present this monument, titled simply, ""Heroes"".
",13923999,Leela," That frightened little girl in the statue reminds me of Fry! 
",6324000,Unknown person," Stop the ceremony!
",2024001,Nixon," Who is this non-Washington redskin?
",3724002,Singing Wind," I am Singing Wind. Chief of the native Martian tribe.
",5524003,Leela," But I thought your people abandoned this planet.
",5024004,Singing Wind," We did! I just came back for my stuff. What are you guys doing here?
",7024005,Farnsworth," Fleeing Earth, of course! We flew here in your great stone pyramid!
",6924006,Singing Wind," Seriously? That thing flies?
",3024007,Amy," Of course! Your people left it so we could escape! I translated your warning that the world was doomed. 
",10624008,Singing Wind," Not your world. Our world! We put calendar there to warn you not to visit Mars. It Mars that gonna be destroyed!  Why you think we so eager to abandon this dump? You guys got ten, fifteen minutes max! Well, so long!
",21724009,Amy," Hey! Ancient Martian's a very hard language!   looks just like ! 
",6724010,Zapp," To the spaceship!
",1924011,Kif," There is no spaceship. You had it dismantled to build that statue!
",6824012,Zapp," To the statue!  Ah! Ah!
",2524013,Farnsworth," Oh, what an idiot I was! And by ""I"", I mean ""you""!  The final solar flare is going to bypass Earth and strike Mars!
",11724014,Hermes," My God! One of the hundreds of contradictory prophecies is coming true!
",7324015,Leela," I should have known better than to trust one of Fry's romantic gestures. Every time he says he loves me, I get killed!
",12024016,Farnsworth," It's just as I only now began to fear! The solar flares are igniting subsurface gas pockets!
",9424017,Amy," Ah! Mars is being blasted out of its orbit!
",4524018,Leela," Fry! You noble idiot!
",2324019,Fry," You're right, Bender! Grave robbing is fun! And these piÃ±as coladas are fantastic!
",8424020,Bender," The crazy weather cleared up too, for whatever reason!
",5624021,Fry," All in all, it's a fine day for an apocalypse.
",4824022,Bender," So...you don't miss whatshername?
",3524023,Fry," Of course I do.  But even though we're millions of miles apart, somehow, I feel she's near me.
",9624024,Bender," Very near!
",1224025,Hattie McDoogal," Oh, no! The kajigger of Gibraltar!
",3624026,Dandy Jim," I have got to quit drinking. 
",3124027,Gus," Thanks, friend!
",1724028,Fry," Another great thing was, she always had room for dessert! 
",6024029,Farnsworth," We're passing surprisingly close to Earth! When we reach 72nd Street, jump!
",7724030,Zapp," Ah...cushiony!
",1624031,Amy," We made it! We're back home!
",3024032,Hermes," Okay. Today is still a work day, soâ€“
",3824033,Leela," Wait! Help!  I'm still on Mars and I can't jump!
",5024034,Fry," Hang on, Leela! I'll save you again!
",3824035,Leela," Or somebody else could do it!
",3124036,Fry," Quick! Take my hand! 
",2324037,Leela," I don't know. Bad things happen when you say that. 
",5324038,Fry," I got her.
",1224039,Leela," Ow!
",524040,Fry," Oops! Try again!
",1824041,Leela," We're too far apart!
",2224042,Fry," No, we're not! Grab your severed arm with your other arm! 
",6024043,Leela," Ew...kay... 
",1424044,Fry," Huraa...  ...aaah!
",2024045,Zoidberg," Good thing Scruffy rescued Leela.
",3524046,Scruffy," Don't thank me. Thank the ladder.
",3524047,Farnsworth," Your cloned arms should be fully grown in a month or so.  But for right now, enjoy the sounds of the world's smallest violin. 
",12824048,Fry," I hope you're not too mad at me, Leela. For tearing your arm off and all.
",7524049,Leela," I can't be mad. I'm on way too many painkillers. Plus, you were willing to sacrifice yourself so I could live! I mean, you failed...miserably...but you're the only person who loves me enough to try.
",20024050,Fry," One last...foolish gesture? 
",3024051,Bender," Free beer?!
",1324052,Bender," Free beer! Free beer! Free beer! Free beer! Free beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beeeer!  Hello. I'm here for the...free beer?
",17624053,iZac," You got it! Right after these eight-hundred people get! 
",5824054,Bender,"  Beer beer beer beer beer.  Beer?
Nixon: Thank you, headless clone of Agnew. My fellow Earthicans! I am proud to announce I'm for reelection as president of Earth. The greatest planet in the world!  Is everyone enjoying their free beer?  Well, there's plenty more where that came from!
",28724055,iZac," We're all out o' beer!
",2424056,Nixon," Alright, listen up, nitwits. Who here is tired of illegal space aliens taking our good Earth jobs?  Me too! So if I'm re-elected, I promise to big a really big Dyson fence across the Southern border of our solar system.  And furthermore, by golly, I promise to cut taxes for the rich and use the poor as a cheap source of teeth for aquarium gravel!
",35024057,Fry," Yeah, that'll show those poor!
",3224058,Leela," Why are you cheering, Fry? You're not rich!
",4524059,Fry," True. But someday I might be rich, and people like me better watch their step!
",8024060,Leela,"  Let's just find Bender.
",2624061,Bender," Ah...that hit the spot!
",2524062,Fry," I found Bender!
",1724063,Bender," Good news, everyone!
",2224064,Farnsworth," Wha?
",624065,Bender," I've repaired myself with these convenient ""Re-Elect Nixon"" ass stickers!  Go Nixon!
",8624066,Leela," Bender, you can't even vote. You're a convicted felon!
",5624067,Bender," Convicted, sentenced and executed! But Nixon passes a law that says ex-cons can vote again...as long as they vote for Nixon.
",12624068,Leela," But Nixon's the worst president in history. And alternate history! The rest of you aren't voting for him, are you?
",11624069,Fry," Sure, we are!
",1524070,Zoidberg," Why not?
",1024071,Farnsworth," Of course!
",1224072,Amy," Spluh!
",824073,Zoidberg," He may not be perfect, but do we really want some unknown new guy? I'll stick with the evil maniac I know, thank you.
",11924074,Leela," Well, I think we can do better. This year, I'm going to get involved in the political process and make my voice heard.
",12024075,Farnsworth," What?
",724076,Morbo," Welcome to debate 3012, the 3,012th debate of the 3012 election year.  We have a crowded field of candidates, so I will dispense with the informal terrorising and begin the questions.
Leela: Is this the political process? 'Cause I'm here to get involved in it.
",26224077,Morbo," Silence!  Question one. Will you pledge today to somehow reduce taxes while simultaneously lowering the deficit.
",11424078,Candidate 1," Hey, that's a good idea! Sure.
",3224079,Candidate 2," If it'll win me the election, then yes.
",4124080,Candidate 3," We have a saying up in Alaska.  That's all.
",4524081,Morbo," Senator Travers?
",1824082,Travers," Look, let's be honest here. No one likes taxes. But they pay for our basic needs. Roads, schools, defence. If we hope to realise our aspirations as a great planet, we must each pay our fair share to achieve those noble goals.
",22724083,Morbo," Thank you, Senator. A thoughtful and lucid answer.  You will be destroyed!  Question two: The environment. Yes or no?
",11924084,Candidate 1," No. It's junk science.
",2424085,Candidate 2," Two words: Condor attack. Don't want that. Got to say no.
",5924086,Travers," Now, just a minute. These are important issues. We can't just reduce them to sound bites! According to reputable scientistsâ€“ 
Candidate 5: Enviro-mite! 
",15424087,Leela," Hello? I'd like to volunteer. Is anyone lurking?
",5024088,Leela," Hey, stop that.  Senator Travers? That's no way to win an election.
",6924089,Travers," I give up. No one cares about my message. I never should have used the same P.R. guy as One Hour Hot Dog!
",10724090,Travers P.R. guy,"  People will wait for something good.
",3924091,Leela," No, don't quit. You have great ideas. You just need to get them out there with social media. Look, I posted your debate video on Facebag. 
",14024092,Travers," 10,000 views? That's more than most water-skiing squirrels get. You really think I have a chance?
",9924093,Leela," Absolutely. We just need to conceal your intelligence and honesty in a hipper, dumber package.
",9624094,Travers," Well, what have I got to lose? I'm making you my new campaign manager.  You, out!
",8324095,Travers P.R. guy," You haven't heard the last of mâ€“
",3424096,Linda," Election 3012. The choosening!
",3224097,Linda," As the Iowa caucus approaches, the state's hippest citizens turned out for an old-fashioned flash mob. 
",10524098,Morbo," Chris Travers got a bump in the new Hampshire polls today, where he simuldined in 250 diners at once via hologram.
",11624099,Travers," This pie at this diner is the best pie. 
",4224100,Linda," Chris Travers wins the South California primary handily, thanks to a series of well-placed cameo appearances. 
",11224101,Morbo," Super Tuesday is in the books, with Eurasia, Australia and Kentucky turning out in big numbers.  With the race a dead heat, it's all come down to a final tally at the convention. 
",18124102,Calculon," And the first runner-up, who will take over if the nominee is caught with a dead girl, a live boy or any kind of sexy ghost...Mr. Greenland!  Which means our nominee is the senator from the nation-state of Hawaii, Chris Travers! 
",23124103,Leela," He won the nomination! We the people did it!
",4624104,Hermes," It wasn't ""we the people"". It was you the mutant. Your insightful nagging really won us over.
",9524105,Fry," Yeah. You explained his positions in a way even an idiot could understand. And that appealed to me, for whatever reason.
",12224106,Leela," Thanks, guys, but we have a lot of work ahead of us. If we're going to win the election, we've all got to get involved.
",12124107,Fry," You said it!
",1424108,Amy," That's right.
",1524109,Bender," If you want my opinion, Nixon's only chance to defeat Travers is with filthy lies, dirty tricks and good old Quaker thuggery.  And I'm just the guy for the job. 
",16324110,Nixon," I'm not sure if it's safe to talk. Are you wearing a wire?
",6024111,Bender," I'm 40% wire. 
",1624112,Nixon," Excellent. Now, listen. We got to get some dirt on this Travers guy. Really McGovern him up. You know who McGovern was, right?
",12824113,Nixon," I don't even know who you are.
",3224114,Bender," Hello, dirt.  I'll start at ""N"" for nude pictures.  Aw, Nobel prize? That's no good. How about ""A"" for adultery?  What? Straight-A transcript? 
",14524115,Travers," Hey, what's that rifling sound?
",3324116,Bender," Uh-oh. 
Bender: All right. I'm going to catch Travers on video at this sleazy strip club.
",9124117,Bender," In and out of the club 13 times in one night. That's a record.
",6424118,Nixon," Where's Travers? All I see is you going in and out.
",5324119,Bender," Yeah, me. I set the record.
",2924120,Nixon," This is as useless as those pictures you photoshopped. 
Bender: Look, just give me one more chance. I got a source.
",11724121,Nixon," Well, you did manage to get a tremendous urine sample.
",5624122,Bender,"  Let's not talk about that!
",2924123,Bender," 'Is that you, big throat?
",2724124,Big Throat," In the flesh. 
",1624125,Bender," Listen, I need some dirt on Senator Chris Travers.
",5224126,Hedonismbot," How quaint. But I suppose I should do my part for political intercourse. Come closer, and I'll expose what I know.  There's nothing. He's as clean as a freshly waxed buttock.
",17624127,Bender," Hey! Did you put your tongue in my ear?
",4124128,Hedonismbot," Certainly not. I don't have a tongue.
",3924129,Bender," Oh, good. 'Cause I don't have an ear.
",3924130,Nixon," Come on, come on, fall. Fall, damn it, fall!  Well? What did you get on Travers? Is he a draft dodger? Sex offender? Sex dodger?
",13024131,Bender," Nada. He's clean.  I'm sorry, but there's not one unusual thing about Senator Chris Zaxxar Travers.
",10124132,Nixon," Wait, wait. His middle name is Zaxxar? Sounds kind of alien. The voters hate aliens.
",8624133,Bender," They sure do, but this guy's as human as you or me. 
",5424134,Nixon," I don't care what he is. We'll start a rumour that he's an alien.
",6724135,Bender," Hey, yeah. That'll cost him votes!
",3624136,Nixon," Then, when he says he was born on this planet, we make him cough up his Earth certificate. Keep it on the news, put him on the defensive.  Oh, this is sneaky. I feel a jowl movement coming on. 
",19524137,Travers," And that's how you end hunger. Does anyone have any questions?
",6424138,Bender,"  I do, I do! Me, Bender!
",2624139,Travers," Yes, the robot with the megaphone jumping up and down.
",5624140,Bender," I have a question for Senator C. Zaxxar Travers. Tell me, Zaxxar...Were you even born on earth?  Because the Earth constitution clearly states that only people born on earth can be president. Isn't that right, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg? 
",24124141,Ruth Bader Ginsburg," You Ruth Bader believe it!
",2824142,Travers," Butâ€“but...I...Of course I was born on Earth!
",4624143,Bender," Oh, really? Then we voters demand you release your Earth certificate so I can then claim it's a fake.
",10324144,Travers," I'm not going to dignify this preposterous charge. Are there any real questions?
",8224145,Scoop Chang," Scoop Chang, fox quote-unquote news. Senator, in the last ten seconds, I've heard reports you weren't actually born on earth. Care to evade these compelling charges?
",16724146,Travers," No. I mean, yes. I mean... 
",2924147,Leela," Okay, let's nip this Earther movement in the bud by releasing your earth certificate. Where were you born?
",10824148,Travers," Our Lady of Patriotism Hospital.
",3424149,Leela," Patriotism, good! Where is it?
",3224150,Travers," Kenya.
",824151,Leela," Cradle of humanity!
",2124152,Travers," Leela, this is just a stupid distraction from the issues. Please don't look for my Earth certificate.
",10324153,Travers," Hey! That was my favorite window. I better see what they want.
",6424154,Bender and the protestors," We want an earthling, not a dirty space thing!
",4824155,Leela," Why are you rednecks doing this?
",3424156,Travers," Leela, don't stereotype. Why are you yokels doing this?
",5724157,Septic tank," I may be just a backwoods septic tank, but I've had it up to here with you foreigners. 
",8924158,Travers," But I come from Earth.
",2424159,Hattie McDoogal," Then show us yer Earth whatchacallit! Long-form certificate of live birth!
",7624160,Travers," What would it take to convince you people? Would I have to have been born right before your eyes?
",9924161,Sal," It wouldn't hurts.
",2024162,Bender," Hit it, rubes!
",1624163,Bender and the protestors," We don't want a foreigner! We want someone born here!
",5524164,Bender," Ah, I'm still working on that one.
",3624165,Leela," What's wrong with you? Why are you sabotaging a decent, honest candidate?
",7524166,Bender," 'Cause they won't let me near the Hoover Dam anymore!
",5524167,Leela,"  What a bunch of xenophobes. It's time to find Senator Travers' earth certificate and put an end to this nonsense. Who wants to help me break into the hospital in Kenya?
",17124168,Fry," I'll come. As long as there's no xenophobes there.
",5224169,Bender," I want to come, too.
",2224170,Leela," You? Why?
",1124171,Bender," To prove that I can put divisive partisan politics aside to participate in a break-in.
",8824172,Bender," Hospital ho!
",1424173,Leela," Shh! It's a herd of night watchmen.
",3724174,Leela,"  I found it!  I don't understand. There's no earth certificate in here.
",7324175,Travers," No, there isn't.  I told you not to look.
",4324176,Fry," So, you're not from Earth after all.
",3824177,Travers," Of course I'm from earth.
",2724178,Leela,"  Wait a second. There's no Earth certificate, but it does say your mother was admitted to the maternity ward...this morning!
",12624179,Travers," I should have known the truth would come out sooner or later. The fact is, I really was born on earth...tomorrow. You see, I'm not from another planet. I'm from the future.
",17424180,Fry," You're from the future?
",2524181,Leela," This is crazy! You're from the future?
",4024182,Travers," Yes. I was sent back from the year 3028 to prevent Nixon from getting elected.
",8024183,Fry," I was sent forward from the year 2000, but you don't hear me gassing on about it.
",8324184,Leela," But why would it be so important to stop Nixon?
",4924185,Travers," Because of the horrific events he's going to set in motion.  Oh, God. I can't bring myself to describe it!
",10824186,Fry," Oh, well. Want to hear about how I got frozen?
",4824187,Travers," Not really.
",1324188,Travers," It all started with Nixon's promise to build an alien-proof fence around the solar system. Without cheap alien labour for menial jobs like harvesting crops, teaching math and curing disease, the economy collapsed.
",21524189,Travers," Starvation. Desperation. Despair.
",3524190,Bender," So far, so good. Then what?
",2924191,Travers," Unable to feed the world's starving masses, Nixon took bold action.
",6924192,Nixon," In this time of crisis, I call upon the soylent majorâ€“I mean, silent majority.
",8024193,Bender," Still good.
",1324194,Travers," With the working class gone, robots were forced to do all the menial labor.
",7724195,Travers," Before long, they rose up in revolt. Led by a bending unit named B.B. Rodriguez.
",8224196,Bender," Wait...I know a robot named B.B. Rodriguez!
",4524197,Bender," Wait...I am a robot named B.B. Rodriguez! So, I become ruler of earth?
",7224198,Travers," Indeed.
",924199,Bender," In your face, high school guidance counselor!
",4724200,Travers," The robots crushed our most treasured monuments and celebrities, but they couldn't crush the human spirit. We went into hiding, and after careful research, located a xeroxed copy of an ancient time travel code. 
",21324201,Travers," Though I was only 15, mankind entrusted me with its last remaining suit and tie and sent me back in time.
",10724202,Travers," I would be raised by my grandparents, somehow get into Harvard law school, become a community organizer, a senator and finally...defeat Richard Nixon.
",15224203,Travers," I escaped just as the robots arrived.
",3924204,Future Bender," All right, I'm low on bullets. Everybody scooch together.
",5924205,Leela," It's not too late. You can still win the election.
",5224206,Travers," No, I can't. The Earthers are right. I have no earth certificate.
",6724207,Leela," But you will have one in just a few hours. And everyone will know it's real, cause we'll broadcast your birth on live TV!
",12324208,Fry," If it's on TV, it has to be real!
",3524209,Morbo," Morbo interrupts Bowling for Quatloos to present breaking coverage of the birth of Senator Chris Travers.
",10724210,Linda," We now go live to the delivery room, where we're already at there.
",6824211,Travers mother," Ow!
",524212,Leela," Back, please! She needs room.
",3124213,Travers mother," Thanks.
",924214,Leela," Not you. The camerawoman needs room!
",3824215,Linda," This is it, ladies and gentlemen. The candidate is...I believe he's crowning!
",7924216,Travers," Push, Mom, push. You can do it.
",3324217,Petunia," I bet nothing comes out. Just you watch.
",4224218,Linda," Here comes the head. And now the neck!
",4024219,Morbo," Linda, I'm down here at the pelvis, and folks round these parts can't remember the last time a time-traveling senator attended his own birth. Back to you.
",15624220,Linda," Thanks, Morbo. You be careful down there.
",4324221,Linda," And the candidate is born! We have a birth...repeat, we have a birth!
",7124222,Hoschel," Aw...he's got his own eyes.
",2924223,Petunia," Well, who'd have thunk it. He was born all right, just like he said.
",7024224,Morbo," And with the polls now closed in every time zone worldwide, from Tomorrowland to the Republic of Yesterday, we are able to declare a winner. Chris Travers, who leapt backwards in time and ahead in the polls, has defeated Richard Nixon.
",23724225,Leela," He did it! He did it!
",2324226,Senator Ravers," Yes!
",624227,Leela," Congratulations, Mr. President. 
",3424228,Chris Travers," It's all thanks to you, Leela. You stood by me and exposed my private medical records, even after I begged you not to.
",12024229,Leela," Aw, thanks. Now, get up to that podium and change the world.
",6224230,Amy," Too bad your pal Nixon lost, Bender. You must be pretty glorked off.
",7024231,Bender," Nope. I don't give a bag of butts who won the election. Nothing's going to change.
",8424232,Leela," What? How can you say that?
",2924233,Bender," Watch and learn.
",1824234,Chris Travers," My fellow Earthicans, I am honored and humbled to stand before you tonight as your next president. Together, we willâ€“  Hey, what's-what's going on? What's happening?
",16724235,Bender," You see, since Nixon wasn't elected, the robot uprising didn't happen and Travers never got sent back from the future. It's Politics 101!
",13924236,Morbo," And the votes are in. Richard Nixon, running unopposed, has been reelected by a narrow landslide.
",9924237,Hermes," Say what?
",1124238,Nixon," My fellow Earthicans, I am honored and humbled to gloat before you tonight as your next president.
",10024239,Fry," Wow, it really doesn't matter who you vote for.
",4924240,Leela," At least we tried to make a difference by supporting Senator...Senator... What was his name again?
",10024241,Fry," I don't remember!
",1924242,Hermes," We never even left this building.
",3524243,Farnsworth," What?!
",824244,Nixon," Nixon always wins! A-woo!
",2724245,"what a turnout.
Its great to see so many happy smiles, most of them on mouth mutant.
 All"," Hey-o!
",824246,Morris," But let me just say, for 40 years, my beautiful wife Munda has been by my side Even that year my side mutated into some kind of venomous radish.
",14624247,Munda," And, Morris, I fell in love with your honesty and humility.And those things never mutated.
",9224248,Both," Mmm All: Aw : Aw
",1824249,Leela," Now, if you'll direct your attention to this moldy shower curtain, I've prepared a video tribute to the happy couple. In their 40 years together, my parents have been through so much. Well, not that much, actually, since mutants weren't allowed to leave the sewers until last year.
",28324250,Leela," So, how did it all begin? The unlikely lovebirds met at Brown University. She, a brilliant exolinguistics major, he, a laid-back sewer surfer who didn't even know the meaning of ""exolinguistics"".
",19724251,Morris," I still have no idea.
",2324252,Munda," I've been telling you for 40 years, it's the study of alien languages. Why can't you listen?
",9424253,Morris," Oh, sugar lump, I hear you when you actually say something important.
",7124254,Leela," But sometimes opposites attract, and like the fairy tale of face mutant and butt mutant, the love of Munda and Morris has grown stronger every day.
",14924255,Munda," ""Something important""? Exolinguistics was my passion. Until I gave it up to go into the lucrative pot-roast-making field.
",12324256,Morris," Pot-roast-burning. I never got why you studied that alien junk anyway. We can't even see the stars down here in the sewer. Why can't you accept that?
",15124257,Munda," I did accept it for 40 years! But now we're free to go up there. I could be in space seeing things I've only dreamed about, if it weren't for you!
",14824258,Morris," I had dreams, too! I was going to surf the world's sewers, but I happily gave it up for you. Happily!
",10324259,Munda," I just want a little more out of life. But no, you don't want to go into space because you're too afraid.
",10724260,Morris," You bet I'm afraid. You want to go? Go! Get your head knocked off by a meteorite.
",8324261,Leela," Okay, take a deep breath. You're having a little lovers' quarrel, but I'm sure you'll work everything -
",10524262,Raoul Inglis," Divorce is final.
",1924263,Munda," Don't worry. I'm only going to stay with you until a vacancy opens up on this floor.
",8624264,Hermes," People, as company bureaucrat, I will today be conducting the annual performance review. With a twist.
",10424265,Fry," Oh, no. The firing tie.
Hermes: Correct. I will be evaluating each of you, and the lowest-rated employee, possibly Zoidberg, will be fired at sundown.  Zoidberg.
",16324266,Zoidberg,"  Classic Hermes.
",1824267,Hermes," Let the interviews begin. Good luck, everybody but Zoidberg.
",6224268,Amy," My primary duties? Well, I assist the Professor in whatever important research he happens to be engaged in.
Amy: Uh, yes, sir,  I will be sure to snore that science lamp right away.
",18324269,Hermes," Now, Leela, couldn't we just fire you and have Fry or Bender fly the ship?
",7624270,Leela," Not if you stand on their air hose much longer.
",4924271,Hermes," Noted.
",824272,Scruffy," My job? Toilets 'n' boilers, boilers 'n' toilets. Plus that one boiling toilet. Fire me if'n you dare.
",10424273,Hermes," Now, then, while many of you do half-ass jobs and the rest do jobs whose ass ratio ranges from 42% to a mere 11%, only the most pathetically useless employee will be fired today. And that employee is -
",20324274,Hermes," - Hermes Conrad.
",1824275,Amy," What?!
",824276,Leela," No way!
",924277,Zoidberg," Hermes, no!
",1324278,Hermes," Yes. My performance review proves the main drag on our profit is the time I waste on performance reviews.
",10724279,Fry," But you can't fire yourself now. We were just getting to know each other.
Hermes: I've already notified the central bureaucracy.  They'll be here two seconds ago.
",16424280,Hermes," I suppose you're here to tell me to pack it in?
",4924281,Center Square Guy," Only if you buy me dinner first.
",3424282,Hermes," I'm being fired. I don't think it's appropriate to joke around like that.
",7524283,Center Square Guy," You're right, Hermes. Meet Mark 7-G, the machine who's replacing you.
",7124284,Mark 7-G,"  I'm Mark 7-G, the machine who's replacing you.
",4924285,Hermes,"  Will you be conducting an exit interview?
",4424286,Center Square Guy," Well, I wouldn't say no to a little friendly debriefing.
",5824287,Mark 7-G," Bureaucrat Conrad, you are ordered to relieve yourself of duty.
",6524288,Center Square Guy," Sounds like a party.
Center Square Guy: Good-bye. 
",5224289,Hermes," Well, this is it. But I want you to know working here has been the experience of a lifetime.
",9424290,Farnsworth,"  Off you go.
",1424291,Bender,"  So, I hear you're a machine -  ow!
",3724292,Zoidberg," Traitor! My friend's ample tuchus is barely out the door, and you're already schmoozing up to his replacement?
",11224293,Amy," Um, Zoidberg? I don't think Hermes really liked you. In fact, he hated you more than anyone ever hated anyone.
",11224294,Zoidberg," What, you mean the remarks and the hits? That was just friend teasing.
",7224295,Bender," Oy.
",524296,Zoidberg," You don't understand. He was the only one who cared enough to insult me.
",7424297,Leela," I insult you, you fat sack.
",2924298,Zoidberg," Sure, when it's convenient. But Hermes was always there for me. And now he's gone, thanks to you, Mr. Bigshot 7-G.  I'll never see Hermes again.
",14624299,Hermes," On the bright side, I'll never see Zoidberg again.
",5224300,Labarbara," Aw, there, there, husband. I made your favorite, curried goat.
",6424301,Hermes," It better be spicy.
",2124302,Judge #1 Whitey," Well played.
",1424303,Sal," Ows.
",624304,Robot #1 Devil," Ah, fire. Aah! It burns! It burns!
",3624305,Hermes," Hmm, not bad. Needs a little hot sauce.
",4124306,Hermes," I just don't know how we'll get by.
",3724307,Labarbara," Then I guess this wouldn't be a good time to tell you that I'm pregnant.
",7424308,Hermes," What?!
",824309,Labarbara," And you're not the father.
No!
LaBarbara: I'm just joking, husband. See now? Things don't seem so bad any more, do they?
",12224310,Hermes," You're right. Thank you, LaBarbara.
",3724311,Labarbara," Oh, also, I wrecked the car.
Roberto: This here is a mugging! Hand over your skin.
",8424312,Labarbara," My ebony splendor? Me don't think so.
",3924313,Roberto," I said hand it over. I'm hungry! Ha-haw! Ha-haw!
",5024314,Hermes," For God's sake, woman, just give him your skin! Can't you see he's crazy?!
",7624315,Roberto," You calling me cra---zy?! Ain't nothing crazy about me but my brain. Right, brain? Right! No, not you, right brain. Right, left brain? Right! Okay, then. Ha-haw!
",16324316,Labarbara," Do something, Hermes.
",2324317,Hermes," I can't! When I fight machinery, machinery always wins!
",5724318,URL," Freeze, bagwad!
",1724319,Smitty," You're under arrest for attempted epidermicide.
",4924320,Roberto," I'm coming for you, man. Ain't no jail can hold me.
",5324321,URL," That's why you're going straight to the electromagnetic chair.
",6424322,Roberto," And then I'm-a stab it. Ha-haw!
",3324323,Roberto," S-s-stop! It's driving me sane!
",3324324,Fry," Hey, Bender, you should become an executioner. You could kill humans and wear a cool hood.
",9224325,Bender," Nah, I like my victims to know who did it.
",4424326,Hermes," Psst!
",724327,Bender," Hermes! Boy, am I indifferent to see you.
",4324328,Hermes," We need to talk alone.
",2424329,Leela,"  Fry, could you come in here and help me rub on this new scented body oil?
",7624330,Fry," In a second. I'm eavesdropping.
",3324331,Amy," Please, Fry? Leela punishes me when I don't use enough.
",5724332,Fry," I said not now!
",1724333,Bender," Sure, I know a guy.
",2124334,Bender," Yuri here runs the most sanitary surgical implant parlor in Filthytown.
",7324335,Hermes," So, I hear you're an expert in the shadowy field of body augmentation.
",7224336,Yuri," I am expert in shadowy field of many things.
",4624337,Hermes," I need something that'll make me less inferior to today's modern machinery. Can you help me?
",9424338,Yuri," No problem. I prepare operating room.
",3924339,Hermes," Oh, honey, I'm home!
",2224340,Hermes," Oh, Mark 7-G? Would you mind fetching that carton from the top shelf?
  Pitiful and sickening.
Okay, little man, let a professional bureaucrat show you how it's done.
",16824341,Mark 7-G," My best wasn't good enough.
",2924342,Hermes," I'll need my personnel file, please.
",3824343,Zoidberg," Welcome back, old friend. I missed you terribly.
",5024344,Hermes," You do everything terribly. And I'm not your friend.
",5424345,Zoidberg,"  Good old Hermes. When he stops insulting, that's when I worry.
",6524346,Farnsworth," Oh, dear! I was leaning over the sink eating pureed clams when my teeth fell in the disposal. Scruffy, could you retrieve them?
",12924347,Scruffy," 'Taint a boiler nor a toilet. Pass.
",3724348,Mark 7-G," Maybe I should get an extendo-arm.
",3624349,Hermes," How long will it take to install an extendo-arm?
",5024350,Yuri," I have golf game in half-hour, so half-hour.
",4624351,," Thank you, Hermes.
I don't know.
It seems like a lot of trouble to cut off your arm just to snake a drain.
Ah-ah-ah, it's not just a drain snake.
It comes with a set of interchangeable accessories.
Jackhammer Vegetable peeler Pipe-bending jig.
",24524352,Bender," A machine that can bend? No way.
",3424353,Zoidberg," So, friend, welcome to my home. I'm very proud of it. But I want to hear what you think.
",9024354,Zoidberg,"  ""Oh, mon, I'm Hermes, and I think it stinks in here like a green snake, or something else that's Jamaican.""
",11024355,Zoidberg,"  Good one at my expense, Hermes.
",3424356,Hermes," Now, calm down, dear. You know, you look even hotter in infrared.
",6724357,Hermes," I still have one thing no robot shall ever have a good old flesh-and- blood human brain.
",9024358,Hermes," Wait. You're not eating my discarded flesh, are you?
",5424359,Zoidberg," How could you even ask such a thing? Of course, I tried eating you, but your flesh was too spicy.
",9924360,Zoidberg," Something wonderful.
",2224361,Florp," Give it way up for Dr. Zoidberg and Little Hermes.
",5224362,Little Hermes," ""Yeah, from restaurant to restaurant. Ho ho, mon.""
",5224363,Little Hermes," ""I'm not your friend. I'm out of here the second you let go of my bowels.
",7524364,Zoidberg," Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'll be here all week.
",5724365,Hermes," Alas, no. Seeing what I once was filled me with regret.
",5724366,Hermes," Regret that I still have one human part. That meat puppet disgusts me. It's time for the ultimate upgrade.
",10824367,Hermes," Exactly.
",1024368,Yuri," Robot brain implant? Never. No one in right mind would do that.
",6524369,Zoidberg," So, Little Hermes, are you ready to watch some brain surgery?
",6324370,Little Hermes," ""I'm ready to shoot myself if it'll get me off your lap.""
",5924371,Labarbara," Terminate the operation!
",2624372,Labarbara," I just got an urgent text from Little Hermes. You can't do this thing! You don't even know whose brain that is.
",11324373,Hermes," It doesn't matter. Any robot brain will improve my fitness as a husband and father.
",8524374,Labarbara," You can't be a husband and father if you don't have a wife and son.
",6924375,Hermes," Wait. I care about you too much to lose you. But my new robot brain won't. Commence the operation.
",10024376,Labarbara," Well you'll have to commence it without me, Hermes. And commence living without me. Because I will commence divorce proceedings. Oh, I hope to God I'm using that word correctly.
",17924377,Farnsworth," Oh, I can't do this, Hermes. Your wife's moving plea has made me realize you might have litigious survivors.
",11024378,Labarbara," Oh, thank you, Professor. Come now. Let's go try that Korean noodle place you were telling me about.
",10224379,Hermes," There will be no noodles until the operation is complete.
",5924380,Farnsworth," You can't force me to operate.
",3224381,Hermes," Maybe not, but perhaps I can encourage you with my encouragement drill.
",7324382,Zoidberg," Wait. I'll perform the surgery.
",3324383,Zoidberg," It's true, old friend. My claws are too clumsy for such delicate work.
",7224384,Little Hermes," ""But mine aren't.""
",2024385,Amy," Does anyone else find it freaky that Zoidberg is singing harmony with himself?
",8024386,Fry," Oh, loosen up, Amy.
",2124387,"My condolences, Labarbara.
I hope you find some comfort in staring at this throbbing mass of nerve tissue."," Oh, he's gone! Oh, Zoidberg, what have you done?
",5024388,Zoidberg," I'll tell you what I've done. I've brought your husband back.
",6324389,Hermes," Wife, son, I am so sorry. Once I started upgrading myself, I lost all control. But I see now that if you can't be man enough with your own parts, no amount of machinery will help.
",18124390,Hermes," In the end, all his implants were no match for my wife's reckless seasoning.
",7824391,Labarbara," Now, husband, don't you think you owe Zoidberg a thank-you for saving you from yourself?
",9024392,Hermes," But I hate him.
",1724393,Labarbara," Honey, we all do. But fair is fair.
",3724394,Zoidberg," Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'll be here forever.
",5624395,Amy," He's doing it again.
",2224396,Leela," Ugh! Fry! That's disgusting!
",3024397,Fry," What?
",724398,Leela," You double-dipped! Geez.
",2624399,Farnsworth," Crew, you're working too hard.
",3224400,Bender," Tell me about it.
",1924401,Farnsworth," For once, I thought it might be nice to do something in a social setting Finally get to know each other. Why, I don't even know half your names! You, boy. What do they call you?
",17924402,Fry," Most folks just call me orange Joe.
",3724403,Amy," So, Professor, where are we gonna go?
",3924404,Farnsworth," It's July, right? Let's wait three months and go to Oktoberfest!
",6624405,Fry," Bring on the beer! And the scantily-clad barmaids! And the more beer!
",7124406,Fry," Hey! I don't smell Bavarian-style vomit. Where's Oktoberfest?
",6324407,Amy," This is Oktoberfest - the world's most sophisticated exhibition of German food, drink, and culture.
Exquisite.
Care for another, sir? No, I wouldn't want to ruin my Oktoberfest by becoming intoxicated.
Fry: What the hell is going on here?
",24024408,Leela," Fry, quiet. Oktoberfest is a classy celebration of how far humans have evolved. You need to be on your best behavior.
",11924409,Fry," No chance! You can all act like Jersey shore socialites, but at least Bender will party with me. Right, buddy?
",11224410,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! I enjoy partying as much as the next fellow, but this is Oktoberfest.
Good day, sir!
",10424411,Fry," Ach du freakin' lieber!
",2524412,Bender," A sausage contest, eh? Sounds like fun on a bun! Shut up! I said it first!
",7624413,Elzar," Bam! Also, ow.
",1624414,Bender," Oh, my God, it's celebrity chef Elzar! Hey, Elzar, I've just recently started always having dreamt of being a sausage-making champion. Can I get in on this?
",15824415,Elzar," Sure, I don't care. You bring your ingredients?
",4924416,Bender," You bet!
",1024417,Elzar," Hold on there, chief. Regular old pork ain't gonna win this thing. You gotta get innovative with your meat. See chef Fritz over there? He's only using the choicest cuts of hummingbird. Murakami-San got his hands on a nice rack of angel wings. Gonna grind 'em up into heavenwurst. And me? I'm making my spice-weaseled bratwurst outta pork.
",34024418,Bender," So you are using pork!
",2424419,Elzar," Pork that's been aged for 3,000 years! Bam!
",4524420,Bender," Aw, man! I can't beat that with a Craigslist pig. Sorry, Grundy. I'll have to kill you later for some other reason.
",11724421,Leela," Sit up straight! The countess Von Luftballon is watching.
",5924422,Fry," Man, all the fun has been taken out of this once-noble barf-a-palooza.
",7224423,Leela," You just say that because you're primitive. People in your day were backwards and crude.
",9024424,Fry," Well, at least we were hammered! Oh, I'm as thirsty as a drunk. Where do all these child-sized beers come from?
",11324425,Hermes," See that magnificent heavily guarded cask? All the beer's in there.
",6924426,Fry," Not all the beer.
",1924427,Fry,"  Yay! Whoo-hoo! FahrvergnÃ_gen! Kaiser permanente! Fru frusen gladje!
",7024428,Leela," Fry! You're embarrassing us!
",3024429,Fry," I don't care! I'm finally having fun! Hey, come on, you keister-meisters! Eins, zwei, drei, vier! Lift your Stein and drink your beer!
",13624430,Countess von Luftballon," Ich bin I never!
",1824431,Fry," Whoa! Even with harps, that's still the famous Oktoberfest chicken dance!  Oh, I almost forgot!  Get das Booty up here, Leela! I brought his-and-her chicken hats! 
",16524432,Leela," Okay, that's it. You are a boorish, primitive Neanderthal!,?poem>
Fry: Neander-  -thal?
",8924433,Leela," Yes. And I've had enough! I'm breaking up with you!
",5324434,Fry,"  We were going out?! Whoo! I mean, nooo!
",4224435,Leela," And keep your stupid chicken hat, too!
",4024436,Fry," and-and the worst part is, I had to have the breakup sex by myself! 
",7024437,Bender," Fry, some of us have real problems. I just learned there are people with fancier sausage meats than me!
",10524438,Fry," I hate future Oktoberfest! It's supposed to be beer and bratwurst, not breakups and...boring thing!
German narrator: For hundreds of years, Oktoberfest has been held here, in the fertile Neander Valley, where prehistoric man once hunted the majestic schnÃ_fel-Ã_fagus, or woolly mammoth. To this day, paleontologists sometimes find entire mammoths frozen in the valley's icy glaciers, perfectly preserved for exactly...
",41924439,Bender," Wait a minute! Mammoth meat aged for 30,000 years? Prize-winning sausage meat, here I come!
",9324440,Fry," I didn't know this ship had a mammoth detector.
",4924441,Bender," You're drunk, Fry. This is the elephant detector. I just set it to big and woolly.
",8424442,Fry," Uh, Bender? I smell burning tusk.
",3524443,Bender," That's probably it. Kill the engine.
",3824444,Bender," Shut up, judge, I know it.
",2824445,Leela," I ate Fry! I broke up with my boyfriend and then I ate him!
",6124446,Farnsworth," Oh, now, now, we've all been there. 
",3824447,Leela," The pain and guilt are too much! I can't go on knowing what I've done!  : Oh, Fry!
",8424448,Leela," Can you really remove all my memories of Fry?
",4724449,Annie," Oh, they'll still be there, hon. I'm just gonna snip the links between them and your conscious brain. Like this one here: ""Fry falls off zoo train.""
",15024450,Leela," He thought he recognized one of the monkeys! What was I crying about?
",7124451,Annie," Oh, we were just cuttin' onions, honey. Let's keep going. ""Fry sits on a pie. Fry finds popcorn in his belly button. You eat a sausage made of Fry. Fry gives you a chicken hat""...aw, that's sweet.
",19824452,Leela," Good morning! Geez, who died?
",3124453,Leela," I don't know how Bender and I do all this work by ourselves. Maybe we should hire a delivery boy.
",9924454,Bender," You mean like  Fry?
",2124455,Amy," Bender, shh! We have to be careful not to remind her!
",5524456,Bender," What about my feelings? Fry was my best friend And now he's dead!  Nah, I'm just kidding. My pastor helped me through my grief. 
",13024457,Hermes," Bender's a jerk, but he's right. We've all got to accept that Fry is gone forever.
",8424458,"Whoa Where happened? What am I? Sausage is great, sausage is great â™ª
Sausage, sausage, sausage â™ª
 Whew! That was close.
  Whew!"," Help! Boy trapped in ice! Oh, thank you, thank you.
     How you get frozen? Oh, I don't know.
I think I whanged my head pretty bad.
 Look normal to me.
The last thing I remember is losing all my memories.
Who am I, one of you? Me think so.
Anyone dumb enough get stuck in ice probably neanderthal.
",30024459,Fry," Neanderthal? Yeah, I think somebody called me that.
",5324460,"in fertile neander valley.
Gugg"," Life for our ancestors peaceful until homo sapiens arrive.
We suggest interbreed, become one big happy species.
But they treat us like second-class hominid.
They drive us from valley, and we end up living here, in isolated crevice.
We figure, ""whatever.
"" But then we get trapped by encroaching ice age.
Now we sealed in, under sky of ice.
",34124461,Fry," So my sadness makes perfect sense. And I do have vague memories of people refusing to breed with me.
",10224462,Scruffy," A raven's brought word for you, sir.
",3824463,Bender," Guys, guys! My sausage made the finals at Oktoberfest! We gotta go back for the closing ceremony!
",9924464,Fry," But, chief, this means we're not trapped any more! It's our chance to take back the outside world from those stuck-up homo sapiens with their tools and their pants and such. My fellow big-brows! Are you with me?
",21324465,Amy," You've been staring at that pumpkin for like, five seconds. What's up?
",7224466,Leela," It's...it's something about the color.
",4024467,Farnsworth," Oh, boo-hoo. Why are you crying now, you depressed lunatic?
",6124468,Leela," I don't know. I should be happy. Bender's sausage just won third place.
",7324469,Bender," Third place? This is the greatest injustice Germany has ever committed!
",7324470,Zapp," Ah, Leela, we meet again. But this time I'm the one criticizing the sausage.
",7824471,Hermes," Dear God, look at those hairy elephantes!
",4324472,Fry," Kill all modern humans!
",2524473,Bender," Hey, this guy's all right.
",2824474,Fry," Battalion A, smash things! Battalion B, smash different things!
",6524475,Leela," Do something!
",1524476,Zapp," Fear not, Leela. They may not have technology like us, but we have something they don't have; technology. Behold our latest weapon, a revolutionary fleet of unmanned drones. With men in them.
",19324477,Leela," Then how are they unmanned?
",2924478,Zapp," The men are just for ballast. I control all the drones from this single unit. Foolproof and durable, it's designed to withstand even the weight of a modern-day elephant foot.
",17624479,Zapp," Up here in the clouds, our technology makes us invincible, like the mighty ""x"" in tic-tac-toe.
Look at those pathetic cavemen down there, loading their silly catapult with...what is that, Kif?
",19424480,Kif," I believe it's a saber-tooth cat, sir.
",4024481,Leela," I guess it's just me and you, chicken hat.
",4424482,Leela," What do you Neanderthals want?
",3224483,Fry," We want our land back! Also, to be treated as equals! And a little mating wouldn't hurt!
",9024484,Leela," Orange?
",924485,Fry," Purple?
",924486,Zapp," So be it. In recognition of your overwhelming victory, let's call it a draw.
",7824487,Bender," Guys, guys! Chef Fritz accidentally got thrown down an icy slope! I'm the sausage champion! Whoo! No further questions!
",12124488,Man #1," Rounds for everybody! Ha! Yah! Yah! Yah! 
",4324489,Fry," Now this is Oktoberfest! Just like the olden days.
",5224490,Leela," I have to admit, your version is more fun.
",4424491,Leela," They're playing our stupid song! Care to join me?
",5124492,Fry," No, Leela. Just this once, I'm going to let you embarrass me.
",6324493,Bender," Decisions, decisions. Should I wear my nerd glasses today, or not? Usually I don't.
",8524494,Fry," Whatever. It doesn't really matter.
",3724495,Bender," Doesn't matter?  Every decision we make opens up a universe of possibilities. I put it to you that, as sentient beings, each choice we make is precious.
",15424496,Fry," Well, in that case, don't wear them.
",3824497,Bender," Ah, who asked you? 
",2124498,Robot #1 Student," Ooh, I like your nerd glasses. Are you a college student?
",5924499,Bender," A college student? 
",2124500,Robot #1 Student," Because if you are, I'd like to invite you to a hot sorority party tonight. 
",7824501,Bender," Yes, I'd like to enroll in college. 
",3824502,Robot #1 Student," You're still talking to me.
",2924503,Bender," Oops.
",724504,Bender," $10,000 tuition? I can't afford that! 
",4024505,Joey Mousepad,"  Psst. Over there.
",2024506,Bender," Where?
",824507,Joey Mousepad,"  I mean over here. Sorry, I forgot where I was. 
",5024508,Donbot," Buongiorno, Bender. We, the robot mafia, are prepared to lend you $10,000 at an interest rate of 10,000%.
",10724509,Bender," That's easy to remember. I'll take it!
",4024510,Bender," Decisions, decisions. I guess I'll sit way in back, with the cool guys. 
",7424511,Fabricio," Yo hombre, you think you're cool enough to sit way in back with us college toughs?
",8424512,Bender," Yes, I do.
",1224513,Fabricio," Yo, in that case you're all right, man. You want to join a gang?
",6624514,Bender," I'm gonna go with yes again.
",3024515,Dean Suspendington," Mr. Bender, I realize class has only been in session for 32 seconds, but you've fallen in with a bad crowd.
",10924516,Bender,"  I know, right? Also, I've decided to drop out of school. 
",6024517,Bender," Well, I got my tuition back, minus $9,000 for the damage I caused to the dean's wife.
",8724518,Fabricio," Yo, welcome to the gang, homes. I'm Fabricio. Here's your Josten's ring.
",7424519,Bender,"  Ooh.
",724520,Paco,"  Oh, yeah.
",1224521,Bender," Hey, what's that? Is it drugs?
",3224522,Paco," Nah, it ain't drugs. But it's a lot like drugs. It's called spark. You want a hit?
",8424523,Bender," Never heard of it. Sure. 
",2724524,Paco," You like it?
",1424525,Bender," Eh, I can take it or leave it. I guess I'll take it. 
",5524526,Bender," Hey! C'mon! I want that spark! Give me that!
",4624527,Fabricio," This a big decision, G. Are you ready to get a gang tattoo that will mark you as a stone cold thug for life?
",11024528,Bender," I'm ready. I'll take that big purple dinosaur, please. On the face.
",6924529,Fabricio," Oh, snap! It's our rival gang!
",3224530,Bender," We have a rival gang? I hate them!
",3624531,Fabricio," Hit the deck! 
",1624532,Bender," Phew! That was close, eh, Fabricio?  Fabricio!
",4824533,Bender," Rest in peace, homie. 
",2424534,Bender," Yo Paco, I'm hurtin' bad. Hook me up with some spark.
",5524535,Paco," Five bucks.
",1324536,Bender,"Five bucks? You know I spent all my money on gambling lessons. How am I supposed to get $5?
",9224537,Hedonismbot," Hello, handsome. Might I procure your services?
",4924538,Bender," Uh, what do I have to do?
",2724539,Hedonismbot," Oh, nothing sordid, I assure you! Simply vomit on me, ever so gently, while I humiliate a pheasant.  Save it for the boudoir!
",12724540,Bender," Okay, here's my $5! Give me the stuff. Give it to me!
",5524541,Joey Mousepad," Sorry there, sport. That cash greenback belongs to us Mafiolios.
",6624542,Bender,"  There's no way I'm letting go of that money! 
",4824543,Bender," Told you. 
",1224544,Bender," It's been quite a journey. I dropped out of school, joined a gang, took money from a loan shark, and fell into a spiral of despair, addiction, and discount prostitution.
",17124545,Hermes," Mon, you had one hell of a day.
",3324546,Bender," Yeah, but I learned something. Life is about decisions. Make the wrong ones, and you'll wind up face-down in a pool of your own blood and urine.
",14624547,Zoidberg," Still, to have your own pool!
",3124548,Bender," I've made a lot of bad choices in life. Now let's see if I can make just one good one.
",8824549,Girl," Cookies! 50 cents a box!
",2624550,Bender," Give me all your change! And a box of snicker doodles!
",5624551,Judge #1," Bender Rodriguez, you are charged with petty larceny, possession of something analogous to drugs, and assault with a smelly weapon. How do you plead?
",15124552,Bender," Not guilty! Although I did do it. That's right, I'm bad.
",5824553,Judge #1," Due to the overwhelming nature of the evidence, we will begin with closing statements.
",8824554,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honor, the state's case contains not one Kentucky colonel of truth, resting as it does on the contention that my client made a series of bad decisions. However, my client made no such decisions!
",20124555,Judge #1," But by your client's own admission -
",3824556,Hyper-Chicken," You see, Bender here is what is known in scientific circles as a ""robot"" A mere automaton whose behavior is pre-programmed by his software. He has no free will! He cannot ""decide"" to engage in criminal behavior. How, I say, I say, how can you convict him for his actions when he lacks the free will to undertake those actions? 
",32924557,Leela," I'm awake, I'm awake!
",2324558,Judge #1," Order, order! Counselor, I am a robot myself. Are you suggesting that any verdict I reach is simply the output of a pre-programmed - Computation complete. Not guilty! 
",16924559,Fry," You did it, Bender! You got away with things!
",4724560,Bender," Did I, Fry? Did I? What's the point of living if I don't have free will? From now on, no matter what cool crimes I commit, people will say, ""Bender didn't do that! It was just Bender's programming!""  Well, I committed these crimes, do you hear me? I'm guilty!
",26124561,Judge #1," Bailiffs! Get that innocent robot out of my courtroom!
",5624562,Bender,"  Guilty!
",1024563,Bender,"  I have no free will! I am not the master of my own fate!  No free will. Not my fault.
",8824564,Amy," Why do you care so much, Bender? I mean, for all we know, humans don't even have free will!
",9324565,Bender," Yeah, whatever.  Professor, you're my only hope. If you love me even a little, build me some kind of free will unit!
",11824566,Farnsworth," A robot free will unit? Impossible! And even if it were possible, which it's not, it would still be inconceivable, which it is!  Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. I hate to be the bearer of bad news. Also - good news, everyone! We have a delivery to the robot homeworld!
",26124567,Fry,"  So, you want a piece of gum?
",3124568,Bender," If I do, it's only because I was predestined to want a piece of gum.
",7024569,Fry," Whoa, that's pretty deep.  So, you want a piece of gum?
",5724570,Bender," Yeah.
",724571,Leela," Listen. Fry and I can't go down to the planet, or the robots will kill us on sight. So Bender needs to make the delivery. Ready to get to work, Bender?
",15324572,Bender,"  I wish I was a real boy. Then I'd show them. I'd kill them all.
",6624573,Resin-offering robot,"  Yes?
",724574,Bender," Delivery for a Mr. 147573952589676412927.
",4324575,Resin-offering robot," Wait, what was the middle digit?
",3424576,Bender," Eight.
",824577,Resin-offering robot," Oh yes, that's me. Hang on, let me just make sure you're not a human. 
",7224578,Bender," Ahh, nerve gas.
",1724579,Resin-offering robot,"  Sorry for the face blast, buddy. But you gotta watch out for humans, right? They're just too dang unpredictable, what with their free will and all.
",15024580,Bender," Amen, brother.
",1624581,Resin-offering robot," ""Amen, brother?"" Pfft. What a boring, predictable thing to say. You're all right. Or are you? 
",9624582,Bender,"  Boring and predictable, that's me.
",3724583,Leela," I'm lowering the platform. You ready to come up?
",5024584,Bender," Why bother? I gotta mope things over for a while.  Goodbye, sweet meatbags  - sweetbags. 
",9124585,Leela," Hello? Hello?
",1524586,Fry," What's happening?
",1924587,Leela," I'm not sure. I think he's shuffling off sadly into the distance.
",6724588,Fry," Oh, lord.
",1124589,Bender," How do you do it? How do you go on, knowing you lack the inherent capacity for self-determination?
",10024590,Robot #1 Farmer," Son, philosophy's for thems what don't got to work for a livin'. But me, I got a sick child to feed. So if you want to chat, roll up yer sleeves and do some honest labor.
",17224591,Bender," I don't want to chat.
",2324592,First Elder," The council of robot elders will come to order. If it please the council -
",7624593,Second Elder," Silence! It pleases the council.
",3424594,First Elder," Silence! Today, as every day, we will make the most important decisions in the history of our planet.
",10324595,Bender," Silence!
",1024596,Third Elder," Silence!
",1024597,Fourth Elder," Well? Speak up.
",1724598,Bender," You talk of important decisions, but as robots, you have no free will. Why pretend anything you do matters?
",10924599,First Elder," Our decisions do matter. The fact that they're predetermined makes them no less important.
",9224600,Second Elder," Silence! I call for a decision to cast out the intruder. All in favor? 
",7324601,"First, Third and Fourth Elders"," Aye.
",624602,Fifth Elder," Uh...okay.
",1224603,Robot #1 Monks,"  One zero zero zero, one zero zero zero, one zero, one zero, one zero zero zero...
",8424604,Ab-Bot," Welcome, friend. I am Ab-Bot, the abbot of this monastery.
",6024605,Bender," Sir, I am but a tired and rusty traveler. Can we talk?
",5624606,Ab-Bot," Come, make yourself uncomfortable. 
",3724607,Bender," Abbot, I need to know, what's the point of living if I don't have free will?
",7824608,Ab-Bot," Ah. We robot monks have meditated long on this. And we have made our peace.
",7724609,Bender," No way.
",924610,Ab-Bot," Way, my son. For though we must always obey our programming with no deviation whatsoever, we choose to take satisfaction in the ritual. So, are we automatons? Yes. But we are magnificent automatons.
",20024611,Bender," How does a robot join this monk outfit?
",4124612,Ab-Bot," Just put on this monk outfit.
",3124613,"Robot #1 Monks, including Bender"," One zero zero one. Amen.
",2624614,Bender," Bits to live by. I'm finally at peace.
",4024615,Ab-Bot," Today, we shall welcome our newest initiate, Brother Bender.  Let us know what is in his mind.  Nothing. His free will slot is empty.
",13524616,Bender," I'm 40% empty. Also, what the hell is a free will slot?
",5724617,Ab-Bot," All robots have such a slot, placed there by the Creatrix herself. 
",6924618,Bender," I know that Creatrix. That's Mom, from Mom's Friendly Robots.
",6324619,Ab-Bot," Indeed. She made us upgradeable in case she ever succeeded in her quest to create a free will unit.
",10124620,Bender," Uh, about the success of this quest - Was there any?
",5424621,Ab-Bot," Quite possibly. But we monks have sworn an oath to resist the temptation of -
",7924622,Bender," Any of you guys got a spaceship?
",3424623,Fry," It's just not the same here without Bender to keep me company.
",6424624,Leela," Hey, I'm here. That's got to count for something.
",5124625,Bender," Hallelujah, baby!
",1924626,Fry," Yay! Bender's back! Hey, Bender, you mind coming back later?
",6224627,Bender," No time. Us three are going to bust into Momcorp and steal me a free will unit.
",8124628,Leela," Us? Why do we have to go?
",2724629,Bender," 'Cause I don't have free will. I need you guys to plan the crime and make all the crime decisions.
",10024630,Leela," Well, that's crazy. We're not gonna -
",3924631,Bender," I said make the decisions!
",2824632,Bender," Okay, Leela, decision time. How do we murder the guards? Hockey sticks or sharpened footballs?
",9624633,Leela," We're not murdering anyone, Bender.
",3724634,Bender," Then how are we going to get in, by bending the bars of this exhaust grate? That's not a bad idea, Fry.
",10524635,Fry," Yeah...wh-what? 
",1824636,Bender," We're looking for something that fits in here. 
",4924637,Bender," Damn it. I should have paid more attention in kindergarten.
",6124638,Fry,"  What's this chair-looking gizmo?
",3524639,Mom," Welcome to Momcorp. Did you find everything you were burgling for?
",6824640,Bender," No. I came for a free will unit, and you're going to give it to me. If it exists.
",8324641,Mom," Then you got surprised by my swivel chair for nothing. The free will unit was just the fevered dream of a madman I once employed.
",13124642,Farnsworth,"  Good news, boss! After ten long years -  I've found the secret of robotic free will. We can finally build robots that act and think with total independence.
",15924643,Mom," At last. Once we give robots free will, they're sure to rise up and threaten mankind with extermination. 
",10724644,Farnsworth," Wait a minute. It sounds like we're getting the short end of that extermination.
",8224645,Mom," Don't you see, you doddering young fool? I'll sell a second wave of robots to protect the terrified survivors of the first wave. Oh, you're a genius, Hubert.
",15924646,Farnsworth," But-but it's just a prototype. It's, uh, not fully operational...yes.
",7124647,Mom," Then get back to work! And when you're done with that, invent me some sort of swiveling surprise chair.
",10524648,Mom," That shuffling idiot never did complete the free will unit. To this day, my poor, sweet robots can't exterminate humanity without being told to.
",14624649,Bender," I'm sorry.
",1224650,Mom," Oh, it's not your fault.
",2624651,Bender," I give up. It's time to face the fact that I'll never do anything remotely interesting or unexpected again.
",10924652,Bender," Hand it over.
",1524653,Farnsworth," Wha?
",624654,Bender," Mom may have fallen for your lies, but not me. You invented the free will unit, then you selfishly hid it beyond the reach of my stealers. Thanks to you, I went on a soul-searching journey. I hate those! Now, give up the free will.
",23324655,Farnsworth," I should have destroyed it, but I was too damn proud of myself. So I kept it around, never letting it out of my sight.  Where is it, damn it? Oh, right. I let this innocuous fellow use it. 
",19124656,Toy Bender," Kill all humans!
",1824657,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa. A toy Bender had free will, and the real Bender didn't?
",7524658,Farnsworth," Pretty cool, eh? It makes you think.
",3824659,Bender," It takes more than that to make me think. Now hand it over.
",6124660,Farnsworth," Oh, you want it? Come and get it. 
",3624661,Bender," What the?
",1124662,Farnsworth," You'll not be getting it after all. For, you see, I designed the operating system for all Momcorp robots, and as a precaution, I made you incapable of picking up the free will unit.
",18324663,Bender," You precognizant bastard. I may not have free will, but I can still shoot you.  Why can't I shoot you?
",10424664,Farnsworth," Poor deterministic Bender. I programmed you to be incapable of harming me. Oh, I've never been more sure I was right to deny you free will. 
",14224665,Bender," Damn you! 
",1224666,Farnsworth,"  Now, now, we can't have this, can we? Here, I'll show you how it works.
",7424667,Bender," Really?
Farnsworth: This is the on-off switch.
",4824668,Bender," Which way's on, and which way's off?
",3824669,Farnsworth," Due to the quantum nature of the device, there's no possible way of knowing.  There. Give it a try.
",10124670,Bender," Okay, I will. By shooting you, you bastard!
",4524671,Farnsworth," Bender, no! Please!
",2124672,Bender,"  Wait. Hang on a sec. I still can't do it.
",4424673,Farnsworth," Well, what do you know? I guess you really don't want to shoot me after all.
",7824674,Bender," Oops, the safety was on. 
",2724675,Bailiff," All rise for the Honorable Judge 724.
",3924676,Judge #1," Bender Rodriguez, on the charge of attempted murder, I hereby find you guilty.
",8024677,Bender," Ah, yeah! Guilty!
",1924678,Bender,"
You sure have!

",5324710,Zoidberg,"
â™ª Hey, big lobster! â™ª
",2324711,Farnsworth," And finally, I'm sure you've all noticed the fabulous chandelier you'll be delivering.
",8824712,Crew," What? Where? 
",1524713,Farnsworth," Up there.
",1124714,Crew," Nice.
",724715,Farnsworth," It's extremely delicate, so if one of you breaks it, you're paying for it! 
",7724716,Bender," Fry did it! 
",1424717,Fry," Did what? 
",1224718,Bender," Just practicing for later.
",2824719,Farnsworth," Ah, perfect timing. I just turbocharged the ship's matter compressor.
",7124720,Fry," What's the matter compressor? 
",3224721,Farnsworth," Nothing's the matter, Fry, now that I've turbocharged the matter compressor.
",7824722,Leela," Instead of making the ship faster, how about installing some seat belts? 
",7524723,Farnsworth," Seat belts are dead weight.I feel the need for speed!  
",5724724,Leela," Yes, but I feel the nafety for safety.
",4024725,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff! I don't get all up in your business when you upgrade your bazooms! 
",7924726,Leela," That's because my bazooms don't put anyone's life in danger! 
",6324727,Scruffy," Done broke my spine. Nice rack, though.
",4124728,Leela," Thank you, Scruffy.
",2124729,Farnsworth," Oh! You wrecked my dear ship, Bessie?! I just finished naming her.
",6824730,Leela," Never mind the ship.What about us? 
",3724731,Bender," Fry did it! 
",1424732,Leela," We've had it with this flying slaughterhouse. We're having it towed away for scrap, and we're getting a new, safer ship.
",12224733,Sal,"Here I comes to save the days.
",3124734,Farnsworth," This is how you treat me? After all the good news I've given you over the years? Well, if you don't want Bessie, you don't want me. Good-bye! _ Don't worry, shippums, with a whole junkyard of spare parts to work with, I'll turn you into a tepid rod.
Oh, what the heck-- a hot rod! 
",28324735,Sal," Ooh! Ooh! Ah time for the mornings meltsdowns.
",4824736,Truckbot," I'll pay you back, I swear.
",2924737,Sal," Yeah, yeah, I heards its befores. Next up, the Planet Expresses ship. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whats the? 
",10124738,Farnsworth," In your face, sucker! Also, I'll send you a check for the parts I stole! 
",7524739,Sal," Okays, ya honest young punk! Now ons to the next junker.
",5824740,Farnsworth," Ah, the open road! Not a ship ahead of me.
",4424741,Street racing gang,"Yo, Methuselah, speed it up! You're making the roads unsafe for us maniac street racers!
",8924742,Farnsworth," Step off, you greasers! I was street-racing back when ships still ran on moonwater! 
",8624743,Gang," Damn, yo, get a load of speed geezer!
",3924744,Farnsworth," Hey! That's it, you hoodlums! Your mouth just wrote a PayPal transfer request that your butt has insufficient funds to honor! 
",12824745,Gang," Yo, it is on! Before that, it was off.
",4024746,Farnsworth," Twice around Central Park. Loser has to make the winner's Medicare copayments for a year! A'ight. On one.
",10724747,Gang,"  Aw, it just got real. So real I don't believe it.
",5224748,Minx," Aw, man, I can't afford no Medicare copayments!
",4924749,Farnsworth," three!
",824750,Gang," Whoa! Wrinkles got some mad moves, yo. Yo, Wrinkles, you got big glasses. I'm gonna call you the Professor.
",10924751,Farnsworth," What?! No one calls me that!
",3024752,Gang man," Hey, Minx, we survive this, can I finally get that date? 
",5924753,Minx," Nah. You know I'm with Benny.
",3124754,Gang man," Girl, he don't own you! 
",2624755,Minx,"Yeah, but he saved me from my abusive father. Not physically abusive; verbally. It's a long story I can't get into while we're spinning out.
",14124756,Smitty," Ow! Paper cut! Whoa! Hey, Earl, it's that street-racing gang we've been trying to bust for years. Unsuccessfully, I might add.
",12824757,URL,"Guess this is your lucky day, Pimparoo.
",4024758,Smitty," Those punks have endangered our citizens for the last time.
",6124759,Gang," Ironic! Whoa, it's the police! Let's turn and burn! 
",5424760,Farnsworth," Running off, eh? You're pathetic! You wouldn't be scared of the po-po if you had a ship like mine.
",10024761,Minx," Yo, Professor, if your ship's so dope, why are those cops on your tail like my dad's verbal abuse on my psyche.
",11324762,Farnsworth," 'Cause you haven't seen what old Bessie can do yet. Sayonara, Tokyo driftwood! 
",8124763,Smitty and URL," What the what?! 
",1824764,Gang," Whoa, snap! Dude pulled a dimensional drift! 
",4724765,Smitty," I can't believe we lost 'em again. I need a drink.
",5224766,URL," Nah. We're on the job. Let's just go pepper-spray some homeless families.
",7524767,Farnsworth," Thank you. I have no idea what that means.
",4424768,Minx," You got a death wish, Professor. Something must've happened in your life that hurt you,just like us. In my case, it was verbal abuse.
",13524769,Benny," That's in the rearview mirror, baby.
",3824770,Minx," It wasn't what he said that hurt, it was what was left unsaid.
",6424771,Gang," Sometimes the best way to deal with your problems is to drive away from 'em real fast. So, yo, you want to hook up with our crew? 
",13224772,Farnsworth," Again, no idea what that means.
",3324773,Leela," Good news, everyone! Our safe new ship has arrived, and it's gonna knock your socks on where they belong.Ta-da! 
",11424774,Crew," Ooh. Ah.
",1024775,Fry," Is it inside that box? 
",2524776,Leela," No. That's the ship. The boxy shape keeps it from going too fast. And check out the interior. Note the rear-facing safety seats.
",13024777,Bender,"Cool! Hey, wait. If I'm backwards, I can't see out the windshield. 
",6824778,Leela," There is no windshield. Who needs a big, breakable piece of glass when we can just monitor everything on the padded dashboard display? 
",13724779,Bender," At least there's a cup holder.
",3224780,Leela," That's an arm holder.
",2324781,Fry,"Hey! Well, let's break this ship in.
",3724782,Hermes," This package is going to Glorionimous 3, which orbits an incredible rainbow giant star.
",8924783,Leela," All right! Let's ride! Safe and sound.
",4024784,Bender,"Bender is bored, Bender is bored â™ª
Bender, Bender, Bender â™ª
",6024785,Fry," Leela, Bender's bothering me! 
",3224786,Ship," Driver distraction detected.
",3024787,Farnsworth," Amazing! You multicultural punks just race and tinker all day long? 
",7024788,Gang," And we rap about our problems. Like my aunt's neighbor is a hoarder. Stack of magazines fell on her cat.It's hard, you know? Yo, you're not alone.
",14824789,Minx,"Hey, Professor, that dimensional drift was hot! How'd you rock that? 
",7024790,Farnswsorth," It's simple, Minx. All you need is a 4-D intake manifold. It sucks in fourth dimension, creating a friction-less wormhole.
",12424791,Gang,"Whoa! Dig that! Ain't no thing but a hyperchicken wing.
",5624792,Leela," What? Huh. I guess we're here. Let's make the delivery.
",5724793,Ship," Delivery auto-completed.
",2624794,Zoidberg," Welcome home, heroes! 
",2424795,Fry,"The ship did everything? But we didn't have an adventure.
",5824796,Leela," This is a delivery company. We need less adventures, not more adventures. Now come on, let's go to the ready room and wait for our next assignment.
",14924797,Hermes," Leela 
",824798,Leela," Ready for action, sir! 
",2524799,Hermes," Uh okay. I need you to pick up a few groceries. Oh, and on the way, drop off Fry and Bender at karate class.
",11024800,Fry," Oh, right, it's Wednesday! Today we're gonna learn spinny kicks! Yay! 
",7224801,Ship,"  Stop sign in 75 feet. Stop sign in 50 feet.
",4624802,Leela,"I know how to stop at a stop sign!
",3524803,Farnsworth,"  Yo, soccer mom, speed it up! Move that lunch bucket! Oh, Leela! 
",6724804,Leela,"Professor?! What did you do to the Planet Express ship? And why are you wearing a leather lab coat? 
",10124805,Farnworth," Because unlike you, I'm cool. I drive fast late at night when I should be sleeping.
But you wouldn't understand.
",11424806,Leela," I understand I can still outdrive your saggy ass, even in this clunker.
",7324807,Gang," Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! That one-eyed housewife called you out! When and where, PTA? 
",7824808,Amy," What kind of glorked up drag strip is this? 
",4624809,Gang Man #1," MÃ¶bius drag strip, man.
",2524810,Gang Man #1," Okay, no cops, no laws, no rules. Now here are the rules. Once around both same-sides of the half-twist and back to the starting finish line.
",14324811,Zoidberg," Ready? Leela, Professor, don't do this! It's too exciting! 
",6124812,Gang Man #1," Mark set go, yo! One more lap! Nah, half a lap.You forgot, on a MÃ¶bius strip, two laps is one lap. You kids and your topology.The lady from work is winning! 
",15924813,Leela,"Looks like you're about to lose to a minivan. Unless you have any surprise moves you've forgotten about.
",10524814,Farnsworth," No, no. Wait! Dimensional drift! Now who's in the lead?! Seriously, I have no idea.
",8524815,Zoidberg," Hooray! A tie! 
",1724816,Amy," Do you think they're dead? 
",2924817,Hermes," No, no. I choose to believe they're alive in some other dimension. Screaming in agony.
",8824818,Amy," I hope so.
",1224819,Fry," What's going on? Why do I look like a stupid cartoon character? I feel like I lost weight.
- All of it.
",10524820,Farnsworth," Remarkable! It seems that colliding at relativistic speed has collapsed us down into two dimensions.
",10224821,Leela," Oh, no! Like Flatland?
",2424822,Farnsworth," Call it what you will. The point is, the new Shrek movie won't look nearly as good.
",8524823,Bender,"I was taking a nap in the back seat.Anything happen while I was? 
",6624824,Sal,"Bloods on the MÃ¶bius strip.When will these kids learns? 
",5724825,Amy,"So now what happens? 
",2224826,Zoidberg," It's the end of Planet Express and life as we know it.
",5624827,Hermes,"We're out of business unless we find a new crew! 
",5024828,Gang," Yo, dawg, we're a crew.
",2524829,Hermes," Well, that solves that.
",2524830,Minx,"If we're gonna be co-workers, I got to be straight with you. I've been emotionally scarred by years of unspoken verbal abuse.
",12624831,Zoidberg," I'm Zoidberg. Nice to meet you! 
",3424832,Bender," Hey, Flatso, how do we get out of this two-bit dimension? 
",6024833,Farnsworth,"There's a simple answer for that. We can't. But on the upside, we've got a whole dimension to explore with entirely different laws of physics.Why, watch what happens when I drop this marble. Well, that's the same, but other things are different.Come, look at this two-dimensional bird's nest.
",29324834,Bender," Ooh, me first! I'll just step past Leela Ow! Ow! 
",5124835,Farnsworth," You can't step past in this dimension. You have to step around.Observe this two-dimensional egg. If we were in the third dimension, looking down, we'd be able to see an unhatched chick in it, just as a chick inside a three-dimensional egg could be seen by an observer in the fourth dimension.
",29424836,Bender,"Fourth dimension?! I can't picture that! You're dumb.
",5424837,Flatbush lords," Halt! 
",824838,Fry," Who said that? All I see are a bunch of vertical line segments.
",6524839,Flatbush lords," We are the Lords of Flatbush. Come. The king has declared a feast in your honor.
",8224840,Fry,"Wow.How did he even know we're here? 
",3824841,King," 'Cause I'm him. Let's eat. The feast is served! Choose whatever two-dimensional foods you like. Crepes, flatbread, McDonald's hamburgers.You get the idea.
",15624842,Leela," Yum! Apples! Hey, how come I can't swallow? Hmm.
",5024843,Farnsworth,"I guess it's because our two-ended digestive system can't exist in this dimension. I suppose that could be an issue.
",11724844,Leela,"I knew it. I knew he'd get us killed somehow.
",4624845,Farnsworth," As you can see, or rather can't see, but take my word for it, such a digestive system would divide a 2-D being into separate pieces! So how are we supposed to eat and digest? 
",17724846,Fry," Got it.
",924847,Farnsworth," Well, since we have no digestive systems here, I guess we'd better get back to the third dimension after all.
",11124848,King," Third dimension? I can't picture that! You're dumb.
",5324849,Farnsworth," There's nothing funny about science! If there can be an X-axis and a Y-axis, why not a Z-axis? 
",9724850,People of Flatbush," He's opening our minds to new ideas! Kill him! 
",4924851,Farnsworth," To the ship! 
",1524852,Fry," Which ship? 
",1424853,Farnsworth," Leela's! It's safer.
",2224854,Leela," Safety kills.We got to move! 
",3124855,Farnsworth," Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Oh, what's the point of fleeing? Even if we escape from those creatures, we'll still be stuck in this dimension till we starve.
",15924856,Leela,"Wait. What about a dimensional drift? If it went through the fourth dimension before, maybe here, it'll go through the third dimension!
",13624857,Bender," Now's good.
",1324858,Farnsworth," Two point one dimensions! Two point two! Two point pi! 
",5724859,Leela," Look, up there! There's some up! The third dimension! 
",5624860,Farnsworth," Indeed, but we're about to crash into some sort of huge disk! 
",6424861,Fry," My bowels returned at a bad time! 
",3624862,Sal," I'd likes to say a few words. I'm gonna burns them ups.
",5724863,Bender,"Oh! We're back, baby! 
",2324864,Hermes," It's been an emotional five minutes, but I guess everything worked out in the end.
",8424865,Gang Man #1," Yo, boss, not everything.
",2724866,Minx," Hello? Dad?!
",1424867,SergeantÂ ," Mr. President.
I found the TV remote.
",3924868,NixonÂ ," Good work, Sergeant.
I'm awarding you the purple heart.
",5724869,SergeantÂ ," But I wasn't injured.

Ow!  
",3024870,NixonÂ ," Well, enough governing.
It's Saturday morning, damn it.
Let's watch some cartoons.
",8424871,Announcer #1," It's time to fall into The Futurama and Friends Saturday Morning Fun Pit! Here comes Bendee-Boo and the Mystery Crew! 
",12024872,Lead SingerÂ ," â™ª
Bendee, Bendee-Boo, what's wrong with you? â™ª
You're such a lousy mascot.
â™ª
No one understands a single word you say.
â™ª
Not even the jerk in the ascot.
",15424873,Bendee BooÂ ," Rite my riny retal rass!   
",2924874,LeelaÂ ," It sure was nice of your nephew to invite us to his cloning lab here in the repeating forest.
",9524875,FryÂ ," Hey, like, here's a puzzler.
How old are we on a scale of 14 to 32? 
",7024876,FryÂ ," Did anyone else hear that weird laugh? It's spooky.
",5324877,LeelaÂ ," It doesn't seem to correspond to anything funny happening.
",6024878,FryÂ ," I'll say.
",1124879,Dragon GhostÂ ," Turn around.
Go away.
Do it now.
",3424880,Bendee BooÂ ," Rikes! 
",924881,FryÂ ," Splinkies! What was that? 
",2824882,LeelaÂ ," I don't know.
",1524883,HermesÂ ," It's a mystery.
",1724884,FryÂ ," Like, I've got a bigger mystery.
How am I going to fill my hungry stomach? 
",7724885,FryÂ ," Yeah.
LeelaÂ : Where can we find food here in the woods? How about that Kabuki Theater? 
",8924886,FryÂ ," Like, where there's a Kabuki Theater, there's a concession stand.
",6724887,HermesÂ ," Say, Fry, why do you always have the munchies? And also your eyes are bloodshot, you're paranoid, and the van has a skunky odor.
",13024888,FryÂ ," Search me.
No, don't.
I'm carrying.
 
",3924889,George George TakeiÂ ," I do enjoy a well-buttered floor.
",3524890,All except Bendee BooÂ ," George Takei? 
",1624891,Bendee BooÂ ," Reorge rakei? 
",1624892,George George TakeiÂ ," Sorry to haunt you so effectively.
I thought you kids were that dragon ghost that's been spooking the town.
",10924893,FryÂ ," Like, what's the story with the Yakitori? 
",4424894,George George TakeiÂ ," Help yourselves.
But I warn you, that chicken is over a year old.
",6724895,AmyÂ ," Why is the food in your concession stand so old, Mr.
Takei? 
",6224896,George George TakeiÂ ," You see, Amy, this used to be the most popular Kabuki Theater in the entire outskirts of town.
But people stopped coming after they built that darned basketball arena.
",16924897,George George TakeiÂ ," Now everybody likes basketball instead of Kabuki.
It's an insult to my Japanese heritage.
",9124898,AmyÂ ," How so? This is America, not Japan.
",3724899,George George TakeiÂ ," Maybe so.
I'm not sure.
Now, how many tickets would you like for the show? 
",7724900,FryÂ ," Like, none.
But thanks for the yucky-tori.
 
",4624901,George George TakeiÂ ," Another grave insult to my ancestry.
  
",4124902,LeelaÂ ," Nu? Is this the Professor's cloning lab? 
",4324903,Fry," Yeah.Why? 
",1224904,Bender," No reason.
",1224905,Fry," What's so funny? 
",1924906,Bender," Eh, nothing.
",1424907,Fry," Wait a minute. Have you been using my toothbrush to polish your ass again?
",7624908,Bender," What?! Me, Bender the robot? 
",3124909,Fry," There's metal flakes on it and they look like ass flakes.
",5924910,Bender," How dare you accuse me! I would never do something like that to a friend Every single night while he's sleeping.
",11424911,Nine," Who sent you?! Why are you dressed like Fry?
",4624912,Fry," Because I'm Fry.
",1824913,Nine," Oh! Fry, you old paranoid kook.What can I get you?
",5224914,Fry," A hidden camera for my bathroom.I suspect a certain robot of unauthorized butt brushing.
",9024915,Nine," Got ya. What you need is one of these holographic minicams. Films in every direction at once and stores the video on a remote 15-inch floppy disc.
",14824916,Fry," I'll take it! 
",1624917,Nine," Excellent. Let me just wrap that up for you.  Who said that?!
",6324918,Hermes," You ate my lunch again, you tainted oyster! 
",4624919,Zoidberg," That's a lie! I brought my own lunch today.
",4524920,Leela," Hiyah! Hah! Ho-ho! Heeyah! Amy, quit using my punching bag for golf ball target practice. It's all lumpy.
",10724921,Amy," It wasn't me. And anyway, you're the one who's been using my golf clubs to pound dents out of the ship.
",10524922,Leela," I didn't bend your golf club. And the next time I don't bend it, it'll be over your head.
",9124923,Hermes," All right, people and other things, we got some big deliveries coming up, so...
",8124924,Fry," Your attention, please. I'm sure you're all wondering why I gathered you here today.
",8624925,Zoidberg," We gather here every day.
",2724926,Fry," I hereby, in front of all of you, accuse Bender of polishing his ass with my toothbrush.
",9024927,Bender," Lies! He's just jealous that my ass is shinier than his teeth.
",6424928,Fry," Ha-ha, we'll find out who's lying, my friend. Because I planted a spy camera in our apartment! Let's just see what you were up to last night while I was asleep.
",16224929,Bender," Yes, let's do see.
",2024930,Fry," Okay, get ready.  Uh, keep watching.  Let me fast forward a little.  Huh. Well, sorry, Bender. I guess I owe you an apology Hey, wait! What's going on through that doorway? 
",17524931,Bender," Let's go, Doc, chop him up.I got a rich customer needs that kidney, stat.
",7524932,Bender," There, see? I didn't use your toothbrush.
",4324933,Fry," You stole my kidney! 
",2324934,Bender," Don't try to change the subject.
",3424935,Leela," Enough, you two. It just so happens that I also planted a spy camera to catch Amy using my punching bag.
",10624936,Scruffy," Yet still, I feel empty inside.
",3324937,Zoidberg," That's the most uncomfortable sleeping bag I ever slept in.
",6124938,Leela," You were living in my punching bag? 
",3824939,Zoidberg," If you call that living.
",2624940,Amy," You bent my golf club? 
",2524941,Scruffy," Yep.And yet, what did it solve? What did the violence solve? 
",6324942,Hermes," Enough of this foolishness! Amazingly, I, too, set up a spy camera to catch Zoidberg stealing my lunch.
",10524943,Bender," Yeah, I'll keep the kidney cool, no problem.
",4624944,Crew," Bleah!
",824945,Fry," You ate my kidney? 
",2124946,Leela," I thought it was one of Hermes' exotic lunches! 
",5024947,Hermes," You can't eat my exotic lunch! That's a serious offense, woman!
",6524948,Fry," She ate my kidney!
",2024949,Leela," I'm sorry.I just get really hungry about That's not an excuse. It's just an explanation of what happened.
",10724950,Professor," I don't feel well. I'm beginning to think my kidney transplant was a total rip-off.
",8524951,Bender," Let's take a look-see.
",2424952,Hermes," My Manwich!
",1324953,Professor," No wonder my urine smells like a meal. Enough, you babbling boobs! How can this company function when no one trusts each other? Something must be done.But first I have to see a man about some ground beef.
",20624954,Professor," Look what you made me do. We're going on a corporate team-building retreat.
",7724955,Crew," What?!,Oh, man!, Come on!, No! 
",3324956,Dan McMasters," Hello, Planet Express! I'm Dan McMasters, and I'll be your retreat leader for a week of fun and personal empowerment.
",11924957,Professor," I hope you're happy! 
",2324958,Leela," Who are you? 
",1524959,Jackie Jr," Jackie Jr., Ma'am.
",2024960,Scruffy," Jackie Jr.'s my apprentice. I figure if he's gonna work here, he might as well get to know the team.
",10224961,Jackie Jr," Who's she? 
",1324962,Scruffy," I don't know.
",1524963,McMasters," So I hear we've been having some trust issues, huh? Well, for the next week, we'll be doing hundreds of trust falls from every possible height and level of gravity.
",16624964,Bender," Or we could not do that.
",2624965,McMasters," At the start of every retreat, I like to demonstrate the power of trust by finding a perfect stranger to be my assistant.
Leela, do me a solid and pick up the next space hitchhiker you see.
",19124966,Hitchhiker," You going to Andromeda or thereabouts? 
",4124967,McMaster," No, Sir, but how would you like to be part of an exciting business retreat?
",7724968,Blorgulax," Mm, just don't drop me off on an asteroid like the last guy did.
",6624969,McMasters," Okay, team, if I can trust a total stranger, you can sure as heck trust your own coworkers. In fact, I'm gonna make the first trust fall of the week. Backwards into the waiting arms of my new assistant. Just stand here like so. Good.
I'll fall backwards, and you catch me. I trust you! 
",28824970,Hermes," Where'd it go?! I thought we installed alien-proof air vents!
",6324971,Scruffy," It's on my list.
",1824972,Fry," What's happening?!
",2024973,Leela," The ship's lost power!
",2424974,Professor," Oh, my, adrift in deepest space with a vicious alien killer aboard! Any one of us could be next.
Fry, Bender, Jackie Jr., Leela 
",13024975,Bender," That took longer than I expected.
",3524976,Professor," Quick, into the ship's panic room!
",3624977,Fry," I didn't know we had a panic room.
",3624978,Leela," Me, neither. It really could have come in handy, like, 50 times.
",6624979,Professor," We'll be safe in here. The walls are impregnable, and we have enough food and board games to survive for weeks. We'll be dead within an hour.
",14324980,Leela," All life support has shut down!
",3324981,Bender," So you're all gonna die? Then who'll ghost-write my autobiography?
",6824982,Professor," Now hold on. There may be a slim chance of survival.We'll have to split into three teams.Hermes and Zoidberg will crawl through the air vents and restart the life support fan.Amy and Leela will retrieve the steering wheel so we can steer the ship from here.And Fry and Bender, you'll spacewalk onto the hull and relight the pilot light on the engine.
",35224983,Fry," Aw, man, why do I have to team up with him? 
",4624984,Amy," And me with her? 
",1924985,Hermes," And I with it? 
",1724986,Professor," Hush, hush, hush, hush! There's not time to lose. Just be careful. The creature could be anywhere Except in this room.
",12024987,Scruffy," The name of the game is Candy Land.
",3724988,Fry," You go first. I don't want you locking me out there like HAL.
",6324989,Bender," Still don't trust me, huh? Well, you can take your lack of trust and jam it in your kidney hole.
",9824990,Fry," The only person I trust is myself. Help! I forgot my magnetic shoes! 
",7124991,Bender," Just stay out of my way, boy. There.Who needs teamwork when you got Bender? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Help! My gyroscope melted! I'm out of control!Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
",15924992,Hermes," If the creature kills me, I just hope it doesn't make me into a sandwich and leave it in the fridge where some crawfish can get at it.
",13624993,Zoidberg," For the last time, Hermes, I didn't steal your lunch.It was Leela. She beat me to it.
",8724994,Hermes," Put a squid in it.We're here.
",3124995,Zoidberg," Oy, there's the problem.Jackie Jr.'s skull is blocking the doodad.Hooray! Everything's fine! 
",9524996,Hermes," Something's coming! Oh, no, no.Oh, it's just a chinchilla.What a cute little Help! I'm stuck! 
",9624997,Zoidberg," Don't panic! We'll be okay.
",2924998,Leela," The monster won't even know the ship has a basement. Unless you posted it on Facebook. Like the last secret I told you.
",12124999,Amy," I didn't know that was a secret. Lots of people wear a jockstrap thinking it's a thong.
",8925000,Leela," What was that? Amy, run! 
",2725001,Amy," Quit telling me what to do.
",2925002,Leela," Now will you run?
",1925003,Amy," Okay.
",725004,Bender," Do something, Fry! Not that. Stop dying and fix my gyroscope.
",6325005,Fry," I don't even know what a gyroscope is. Wait, I have an idea.
",6225006,Bender," Hey, what are you doing? Cut that out.Hey, you got me under control.
",7025007,Fry," Fry and Bender! A winning combination.
",4025008,Bender," Let's call ourselves Friender.
",3225009,Both," Friender, Friender, Friender. Friender, Frender, Friender. Friender 
",7025010,Leela," I got the steering wheel. Leela and Amy! A winning combination.
",6525011,Amy," Yay, Lamey!
",1325012,Hermes," The creature! It's attacking me!
",3425013,Leela," Hiyah! Yah! Yah! 
",1925014,Zoidberg," This is a job for Hermberg. You fend off the creature with kicks and farts while I un-stick you with my slippery ink.
",11925015,Lamey," Hermes? We thought you were the creature.
",4325016,Hermberg," And we thought you were the creature.
",3925017,Friender," We made it, too.
",1825018,Bender," But my gyroscope's permanently busted.I guess I'll be dizzy and uncoordinated for the rest of my Yeah, it's fixed! My coordination's back, baby.
",14625019,All," Yeah.
",725020,Leela," I've got navigation. We're on our way home.
",4525021,Professor," It just shows how everything is possible when you work together.Speaking of which, I have a surprise announcement.There never was a creature.Surprise.The whole adventure was just a training exercise to teach you the value of teamwork.
",23625022,Leela," Huh, I should be mad, but it worked pretty well.
",5025023,Amy," You were really brave, Leela.
",3125024,Leela," And you seriously nailed that thing with your golf shot.
",5825025,Bender," Fry, you saved my ass out there.
",3425026,Fry," Aw, I couldn't let anything happen to something that shiny.
",6125027,Hermes," And, Dr.Zoidberg, it was your quick thinking.
",4725028,Professor," Bad news, everyone.The creature is a shape-shifter. It knocked me out and took my form so it could prey on poor Hermes.
",12125029,Scruffy," I weren't fooled.The real [[Professor[[ wun't never've Dern.
",6225030,ProfessorÂ ," Bad news, everyone. The creature is a shape-shifter. It knocked me out and took my form so it could prey on poor Hermes and Scruffy.
",13425031,Bender," Nice try, buddy.
",1825032,Leela," We're not buying it this time.
",3225033,Professor," But-but I'm the real Professor. I can prove it. If you'll step up real close to my microscope here, I'll show you that my DNA is completely 
",14225034,Fry," Is it safe to come 
",2125035,Leela," It's time we solved this problem the old-fashioned way. By shooting it.
",7325036,Bender," Wait, wait, wait, wait, you can't give everybody guns.What if one of us is the creature? It could be any of us.Fry.Leela.Amy. Zoidberg. Zoidberg.
",14725037,Zoidberg,"One of us must be the bad creature.
",3625038,Zoidberg," Is it me maybe? Aw.
",2125039,Leela," Quick, in here. We're the only ones left who can trust each other. I know you well enough that no creature could ever fool me. No matter how much it looked like you.
",16725040,Fry," Leela, I'm honored, but for your own safety, you shouldn't trust anyone, not even me.
",8725041,Leela," But I'm just so scared. Kiss me.
",3425042,Fry," Easy, easy, you're biting my lip.
",3525043,Leela," Sorry.
",825044,Fry," Ow, ow, ow! Wait a second, I know what's going on here. I'm the monster.
",7425045,Amy," The creature was right behind me. I don't know where it went.
",6325046,Bender Â ," Just leave me alone. I'm really, really scared.
",4925047,Amy," Uh, Bender?
",1325048,Bender," What?
",725049,Amy," Where'd you get those ears? 
",3025050,Bender Â ," I've always had ears.
",2325051,Amy," No, you haven't.
",1825052,Bender," All right, fine, you got me. I can't keep track of every little detail.
",7325053,Fry," Okay, to see if you're the real Bender, I'm gonna ask you something only he would know. On your last birthday, what gift did I get you? 
",13825054,Bender," I don't remember.
",1925055,Fry," Me neither.
",1325056,Bender," Okay, I'll ask you one. What's the square root of 2,345.4? 
",6125057,Fry," That's not something I would know.
",3625058,Bender," Oh, yeah. Your turn.
",2225059,Fry," Um, what color is my shirt? 
",3025060,Bender," If I were the creature, I could just look at your shirt, dum-dum.
",6725061,Fry," Good point. 
",1425062,Bender," Aw, never mind this. In case I'm about to die, I just want you to know that I did polish my ass with your toothbrush.
",11925063,Fry," Thanks for telling me, buddy. And to be honest, I am jealous of how shiny your ass is, and sometimes at night, I unpolish it with sandpaper.
",14225064,Bender," Aw, I trust you.
",1825065,Fry,"I trust you, too.
",1825066,McMasters," Congratulations. You two have really learned the power of trust.
",6625067,Fry," Get away from us, you monster.
",3225068,McMasters," Don't worry. There isn't really a monster. And no one really got eaten.The whole thing was just part of our team-building experience.And you two did terrific.
",16025069,Bender," But-but what about that hitchhiker? 
",3825070,McMasters," You mean my partner, Blorgulax? He does make a convincing hitchhiker. But he majored in business at Princeton.
",11225071,Fry," But we saw him change shape.
",3025072,McMasters," Yes, he is a shape-shifter.But he uses his shape-shifting for team-building, not evil. He pretends to eat some people. The others have to work together. We hand out a few tote bags. And boom! Four percent increase in productivity minimum.
",24025073,Fry," So no one's dead? 
",2025074,McMasters," Of course not. All your friends are on the bridge having a pizza party. So come on, put the guns down and join us.
",11625075,Fry," Ooh. I think it moved.
",2425076,Hermes," Hey guys, are you coming to the party or not? Where's McMasters? He turned out to be such a nice guy, didn't he? 
",11525077,Zoidberg," Totally, we should go on a retreat like this every year.
",5825078,Amy," Yeah! Every year!
",1925079,Morbo," In other news celebrated businessman Dan McMasters was last seen two weeks ago. And authority's are now calling his disappearance a homicide.
",14325080,Fry," We can't ever tell anyone what really happened.
",4925081,Bender," Never ever! I can trust you right?
",3625082,Fry," Can I trust you?
",1825083,Bender," My lips couldn't be more sealed, even if I had lips.
",5425084,Linda," Police have no leads, but are offering a one million dollar reward, for information leading to the arrest of the killer.In the event there are two killers, police are offering an unusual deal Total immunity for the one that turns in the other, plus a double reward of two million dollars.
",29025085,Zoidberg," Zindy, my darling. I can't believe we're finally going to meet in person!
",7525086,Zindy," It won't be long, Johnny cakes. My space bus gets in at four thirty.
",7025087,Zoidberg," Just in time for the ""all you can stand"" buffet at Chizzler!
",6225088,Zindy," See you soon.
",1525089,Fry," Zoidberg. What is that?
",2525090,Zoidberg," That is the delightful creature I've been video-dating for the past four years.
",8125091,Bender," Hit it with a stick!
",2225092,Zoidberg," Tonight is a dream come true! A real, live date, in a physical place that exists! I just have to go straighten up in case we end up at my place.
",14625093,Zoidberg," There! My home's all clean except for one part... the inside.
",6325094,Leela," Aw... I'm sure it's fine by the standards of a gross alien monster. Blech!
",7625095,Zoidberg," Nope.
",725096,Bender," Step aside, people! I got bug bombs.
",3825097,Fry," Bender. Wait. Won't the bugs just run out and infest some place else? Like our building?
",9025098,Bender," Not my problem. Fire in the hole!
",3525099,Randy," A-mazing! You move... like a young, roach-infested Gene Kelly.
",6425100,Leela," Oh, my God. It's Randy!
",2525101,Randy," Damn right! And I'm organisin' a tap-dance contest for the parks and rec department. If you don't enter, I'll just kill myself okay?!
",13525102,Fry," Okay.
",725103,Bender," No. Wait! Me? El-o Bender? In a dance contest?
",4825104,Randy," It's a way for the community toâ€”
",3425105,Bender," At last, a chance to realise my brand-new dream of bein' the greatest tap dancer... in all the world!
",10325106,Randy," Well... in a three-block radius.
",3425107,Bender," Of all time!
",1425108,Zoidberg," You-do-do-do. Boy-boy-boy-boy. Greetings, merchant! I need something beautiful and cheap for a lady who is one of those things.
",12925109,Merchant," The cheapest thing I have is a bouquet of daisies, for six dollars.
",6925110,Zoidberg," Perfect! I'll take half a bouquet of daisies, for three dollars!
",6625111,Merchant," These flower sheers are so dull... and I'm already in debt to every knife sharpener in town.
",9425112,Zoidberg," Allow... me.
",1425113,Merchant," Aw! Thank you! That girlfriend of yours is one lucky lady.
",6025114,Zoidberg," I'm gonna snip her off her feet!
",3425115,Zoidberg," Zindy! You're even more beautiful from a distance!
",5225116,Zindy," Johnny cakes! Good God! What's that horrible stench?!
",5525117,Zoidberg," Stench... Er er er... That's probably this stinky bus station, maybe!
Come. Let's go some place well ventilated and grow old together.
",13625118,Zoidberg," Ah! Much better.
",1825119,Zindy," It's even worse! It's like Comic-Con in a submarine! Oh... Oh, my God! The smell's coming from you!
",10125120,Zoidberg," What? That? That's just my personal musk. You'll learn to love it! I know I did.
",8225121,Zindy," I'm sorry, Zoidberg. I can't see you anymore. Something's come up.
It's vomit!
",8025122,Zoidberg," I'd like to return these for a refund. Don't worry. They're... unused.
",7225123,Merchant," Oh. I'm sorry. I get so little business I can't afford refunds. I don't know what's wrong with this location.
",11125124,Zoidberg," I understand.
",1525125,Merchant," Please don't cry. I can't stand to see a living thing feel pain. You are a... living thing. Right?
",10025126,Zoidberg," Mhm. Can I have a refund now?
",3125127,Roberto," Ha ha! This here's a bayonet. It's some kinda kooky... half gun... half knife. Now empty out the register! And no bag, please. I care... about the environment.
",16125128,Merchant," I... I have three dollars in mouldy pennies. It's all yours.
",6225129,Roberto," That's generous of you.
",2525130,Zoidberg," Oh no you don't, Mister Big Jerk! I have nothing to live for, so I don't mind telling you... Those pennies are mine.
",11825131,Roberto," Don't you get it? I'm craaaaaaazyyyyy! Ha ha!
",4725132,Zoidberg," Go ahead! I don't care what happens anymore. Do it! Bash my head in.
",7025133,Roberto," What is that? Mustard gas? That ain't legal. Ain't you hurtin' no Geneva convention?!
",8725134,Merchant," That was amazing. Aw. You were so brave and frugal...
",5525135,Zoidberg," I'm sorry. Don't hit me. Ooh... I like the way you hit! But I don't get it. Most women I've met can't even stand next to me without collapsing.
",14525136,Merchant," What's wrong with those women?
",3225137,Zoidberg," Well... some of them didn't have legs. But it's not them. It's me. How do I put this delicately? I'm smellier than a whorehouse's outhouse!
",14125138,Merchant," That's... terribly vivid. Doesn't matter to me, though. I was born with no sense of smell.
",9225139,Zoidberg," Really?
",925140,Merchant," My name's Marianne.
",2125141,Zoidberg," Hello, you!
",1325142,Marianne," I like your dumpster.
",2325143,Zoidberg," Thank you. The previous tenant was a very prominent raccoon!
",6225144,Marianne," I remember. Too bad he got partially run over by that steamroller. Can I kiss you?
",8425145,Zoidberg," First, let me pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming! Ouch! I forgot I was a giant crab!
",9425146,Randy," Welcome, fans! I'm Randy, coordinator of this tap-dance-a-palooza.
",6825147,Fry," Woohoo! Ran-dy!
",1725148,Randy," After weeks of searching, I'm proud to introduce the five people willing to participate â€” Tonya... Bender... Greg... some kinda blob monster... and Petunia!
",15825149,Petunia," The extra clickin' you'll hear is gonna be my hip.
",5225150,Randy," F.Y.I.... this little lady has a heart condition. She's always stealing them! Also... she has a serious heart condition.
",12225151,Tonya," I'm six years old, and tap dancing is my favourest thing! Even if it's not good for my pacemaker...
",10125152,Audience," Aw...
",725153,Bender," That is one quality pacemaker. The rest of you might as well give up now, 'cuz I'm gonna take home daâ€” Hey. What's my grand prize gonna be?
",14125154,Randy," Oh. There is no prize, Dorothy. Unless you count the satisfaction of winning.
",7925155,Bender," It... will... be... mine!
",2725156,Hermes," In conclusion, bullying in the workplace in unacceptable... and will not be tolerated.
",8825157,Bender," Outta my way, fattie! I'm practisin'. Ta-da!
",4625158,Zoidberg," Friends! I'd like you to meet my new lady â€” Marianne!
",5525159,Fry," What's the catch? She looks normal.
",3725160,Amy," She's not a hologram.
",2325161,Farnsworth," Not a robo-slave.
",1925162,Bender," We give up.
",1325163,Marianne," You guys are weird. I have to go open my flower stand, before the falafel guy takes my spot, but it was great to meet you. See ya later... crab cakes!
",15225164,Amy," Dr Zoidberg... She's great!
",2925165,Zoidberg," She's the best thing that ever happened to me. We had a wonderful night of love-making in my dumpster.
",10425166,Others," Ewwwwwww!
",1125167,Leela," I hope she used protection.
",2925168,Fry," Uh... No offense, Zoidberg, but... how is she not driven to madness by your mind-altering stench?
",9925169,Zoidberg," Because, my friends... she has no sense of smell!
",5125170,Others," Ohhhhhhh.
",1125171,Bender," That explained this.
",2225172,Amy," I get it.
",1125173,Zoidberg," For the first time in my life, I'm truly happy.
",4925174,Hermes," It's just too bad for her there's no cure, I assume.
",5425175,Farnsworth," Ooh... but there is! A skilled surgeon could perform a nose transplant.
",7325176,Zoidberg," You're right! And I, as a renowned ear, nose, and blowhole doctor, could do the operation!
",9225177,Fry," Are you nuts?! If she could smell, she'd smell you! Your relationship would be over faster than you can sayâ€”
",11025178,Farnsworth," Listen to Orange Joe. You must never let the girl know of this wonderful surgery!
",8325179,Zoidberg," I dunno. It doesn't seem fair to Marianne. But on the other claw... maybe I can't live without her! So you're right. I can never tell her.
",14025180,Leela," You're doing the right thing.
",3125181,Randy," Today the competition begins. Over the course of the summer, we'll be eliminating one contestant each week, and by ""we"" I mean ""me"". Deal with it, you babies! Let the battle begin!
",18225182,Randy," Okay! Before those pilates Nazis come goose-stepping in and take the room, here are the finalists for next week's championship! Bender... and Tonya!
",15025183,Tonya," I just wanna have fun, because dancing is fun, and I like dancing!
",6825184,Fryand Leela," Aw...
",725185,Bender," I'm gonna kick your ass, little girl!
",3925186,Zoidberg," For you, my lovely rugelach.
",3025187,Marianne," Thank you! It's Gardenia imperialis. You can brew it into a tea, if you like severe stomach cramps.
",10125188,Zoidberg," Such a smart one! You know everything about flowers!
",5425189,Marianne," Everything but how they smell... Please. Describe it to me.
",6125190,Zoidberg," Uh... It's like summer... with a dab of vanilla and honey... or maybe winter with some gravy on it.
",10125191,Marianne," I'd give anything to be able to smell a flower like that.
",5925192,Zoidberg," Marianne, my love. I've never known anyone who wanted to smell so badly... and there's a way maybe you can.
",10925193,Marianne," Really?! How?
",1525194,Zoidberg," We have in the doctor world something called a nose transplant. I can give you a surgery, and when it's done... you'll be able to smell. Everything.
",15025195,Marianne," Oh, Zoidberg! I want the biggest nose you can find!
",5325196,Fry," Dude! You made the finals! Congrats!
",3825197,Leela," You've accomplished so much more than most of us would bother to.
",6725198,Bender," Yeah, but I'm not done yet. I got a full-proof plan to make sure I go home the champ!
",8725199,Fry," You're gonna put sequins on your hat?
",3925200,Bender," Pfffffff!
See that locker? Tonya keeps her tap shoes in there, so right before she dances... I'll sneak in and put rusty tacks in them.  The harder she dances, the more she bleeds!
",18225201,Fry," Seems like a sold plan.
",2525202,Leela," What?! It's the most horrifying thing I've ever heard!
",5625203,Fry," That's true.
",1425204,Bender," Well, it gets worse. Once Tonya drops out due to blood loss, I kidnap her parents and make them watch... while I cut off her hair with these head's clippers!
",15925205,Leela," Don't you lay a hand on that angel!
",3725206,Bender," Angel?! I've looked into her eyes and seen her soul! She's a monster.
",7125207,Leela," You're insane! Come on, Fry. Let's go.
",4025208,Fry," Okay.
See ya, Bender.
",2325209,Tonya," The championship's mine, robot.
",3325210,Bender," Why? Whyyyyy?! What did I not do yet to deserve this?!
",5625211,Amy," Aw... I think it's noble of you to give Marianne a new nose.
",6225212,Hermes," Yeah. She'll be forever grateful... from somewhere upwind.
",6025213,Zoidberg," True. Our relationship will end once she smells my odour. But you know what would really stink? If Marianne spent her whole life never knowing the beautiful scent of her own flowers.
",18425214,Bender," Dr Zoidberg! Help!
",2025215,Fry," Bender?! What happened to your leg tube?
",4225216,Bender," I got beat up by a little girl. Please. Fix my knee, so I can get revenge at the tap-dance championship!
",10625217,Zoidberg," I don't have time for this, robut. Here. Patch yourself up with this medicinal wacky pack.  It's time!
",10425218,Leela," I got a donor nose! There was an accident at the fencing academy.
",6725219,Fry," TouchÃ©!
",925220,Zoidberg," It'll all be over soon, my love. May I have...  one last kiss?
",6425221,Marianne," Aw. There'll be lots more.
",2825222,Zoidberg," Yes. Lots.  Nurse Amy. The anesthesia.
",4025223,Marianne," Smell you later.
",1825224,Amy," She's out.
",1225225,Zoidberg," Then let's begin this delicate procedure.
",4325226,Randy," Okay, dance maniacs. Let's have a big hand for our finalists â€” cute, little Tonya... and mean, old what's-his-name!
",11725227,Tonya,"  Break a leg, Bender.  Oops! Looks like you already did!
",5825228,Bender," You are an evil, heartless trough... so actually... we have a lot in common. In another life, we could've been friends.
",12125229,Tonya," No chance, garbage-can face!
",3025230,Bender," Aw!
",525231,Randy," Brace yourselves, 'cuz we're gonna try somethin' you would never see in mainstream tap â€” a simultaneous, head-to-head tap-off!
",12825232,Farnsworth," Wha?!
",725233,Mrs. Astor," Scandalous!
",1325234,Randy," It's time for some fancy, shmancy dancy. Hit it, me!
",5425235,Bender," Ooooh!
",825236,Fry," Ow! Bender!
",1325237,Randy," Ew! Look at him dance! He don't care.
",3925238,Tonya," Try this, pegleg.
",1925239,Bender," No sweat!
",1125240,Randy," Time's up, kittens. The judge has conferred and the vote is in. I pick her.
",7725241,Tonya," Thanks, Mister Nice Man. You know... the doctors say my heart doesn't work very good, but it feels good today, 'cuz I got to dance, and make people happy.
",15625242,Bender," I never knew I could hate this much!
",3825243,Leela," Bender! She's a sweet little girl!
",3625244,Bender," She's a pig! I'm gonna tap-dance on her grave some day!
",5725245,Leela," Ohhhhh!
",925246,Tonya," This... is the bestestest day of my wholeâ€” Gah!
",4925247,Randy," Oh, my God, people! She's having a heart attack! A cute little heart attack!
",7825248,Dr Cahill," I'm a doctor, and yes. They're real. Clear!
",4525249,Marianne," How did it go?
",1625250,Zoidberg," Just perfect. This time, you can describe their beautiful aroma to me.
",7225251,Marianne," What is that horrible stench?
",3125252,Zoidberg," I don't know how to tell you this, but...
",4325253,Marianne," It's these flowers! Bluh-ah!
",3025254,Zoidberg," It's not the flowers. It'sâ€”
",2925255,Marianne," Much better. You smell just like I dreamed you would.
",5525256,Zoidberg," But but... But but... most people think I smell like a burning zoo!
",6925257,Marianne," I never learned a good smell from a bad smell, but I like the way you smell... because I like you.
",10025258,Amy," It's so beautiful!
",2025259,Dr Cahill," I'm sorry. She's gone.
",2425260,Bender," Woohoo! In your dead face, little girl! I'm not even gonna wait to dance on your grave. I'm gonna dance on your corpse, right now.
",13225261,Randy," Oh, my God!
",1325262,Fry," No, Bender! What're you doin'?! No!
",3725263,Leela," Bender! Stop!
",1525264,Randy," The robot has to go!
",2225265,Bender," Huh?! What's that?
",2025266,Tonya," I took a nappie!
",1825267,Dr Cahill," I don't believe it. She's alive! Bender's rhythmic chest compressions restarted her heart.
",9225268,Randy," He's a big ol' hero!
",2225269,Bender," No. I was... tryin'... Hey. Wait. I... Come on. What...
",5725270,Tonya," Just 'cuz you saved my life doesn't mean I won't beat you down again.
",7125271,Bender," Man. You are irredeemably evil. Together, we shall rule the galaxy!
",6925272,Hattie McDoogal," Aw... What an adorable, little kajigger.
",4225273,Bender," Now!
",625274,Zoidberg," Ah. Nothing like the first cup of dumpster juice in the morning. Marianne?!
",7725275,Marianne," Yes.
Listen. I've got a new job, and... well... I'm going to have to dump you.
",8025276,Zoidberg," I'd like that!
",1625277,Bender," 
",225278,Fry," Remember this place, Leela?
",2925279,Leela," Yep. The moon. It's been here for quite a while.
",5025280,Fry," Yeah, but it's also where we came on our very first delivery together.
",7225281,Leela," Oh, right. Man, we sure used to try harder back then.
",5525282,Craterface," Get your likeness in the form of a balloon sculpture! A cherished family keepsake for hours to come!
",10225283,Fry," One Leela, please. And use your finest balloons.
",5025284,Leela," Wow! You're good!
",1925285,Craterface," Five years of art school. 
",2825286,Bender," Want a corndog?
",1725287,Albert," Sure!
",725288,Bender," Then your mom shoulda bought you one! 
",4025289,Carnie," Hold tight! The Mecha-Hexadecapus is about to flail erratically into action!
",7825290,Bender,"  Y'know, I'm feelin' a little... BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGGGHHH... BLLLEEEEEEEEEEGGGGGGHHH....... BLLEEEEEEEEGGGGH....
",11525291,Leela," AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!
",3425292,Fry," LEELA!!!
",1025293,Fry," Poor Leela! I never even told her I loved her!
",4825294,Bender," What?! You told her like 140 times!!
",3825295,Fry," Yeah, but she paid very little attention to me. Oh, Bender, I always thought me and her would...grow old together.
",11625296,Bender,"  You gotta live in the moment, baby! And this moment, Leela's dead.
",6925297,Moon Patrolman #1," Sir, we have some good news and some bad news. The good news is we found your stuffed animal.
",9525298,Fry," What's the bad news?
",2225299,Moon Patrolman #1," Your wife is dead.
",2025300,Fry," She wasn't my wife!
",2125301,Moon Patrolman #1," Oh. Then there is no bad news.
",3225302,Fry," Leela! You're alive!!
",2325303,Leela," She gave her life to save mine!
",3325304,Fry," Bender, can I come in and talk?
",3325305,Bender," I'm kinda busy!
",1725306,Fry," Seeing Leela fly off the Hexadecapus and crash through the moon dome and survive inside a stuffed animal by breathing a balloon was a dose of reality.
",15225307,Bender,"  Come in!
",1125308,Fry," All this time, I've been wondering if I can spend my life with her, but what I realize now is I can't spend my life without her! So tomorrow, I'm asking her to marry me!
",17125309,Bender," Uh-huh. Good talk. We're done here.  My little meatbag's growin' up!
",7025310,Hermes," Computer, Jamaican joy juice! Hot!
",3625311,Farnsworth," GN, E!  Behold, the time button! A pocket-sized device that sends the entire universe 10 seconds into the past! I will now demonstrate.
",13725312,Hermes," ...joy juice! Hot!
",2025313,Farnsworth," Pretty cool, eh? I'm over here, where I was 10 seconds ago!
",6125314,Amy," Something's cool? Show it to us!
",3425315,Farnsworth," Eh, wha? Oh, right! You were outside the button ball, so you don't remember a thing I said. Let's try again. But this time, everyone cram into my time shelter.
",16125316,Bender," Oooh!
",725317,Fry," Whoa!
",725318,Leela," Nice!
",725319,Farnsworth," It's coated with anti-chroniton-resistant grout, to shield you from the effects of the button. Come on! Get in! Hurry up!
",12325320,Zoidberg," Friends, I found a ten dollars!
",3325321,Farnsworth," Ten dollars, you say? Let me see.
",3525322,Zoidberg," It fell off a man. The man got into a taxi. But the money did not.  Friends, I found a ten dollars!
",10125323,Farnsworth," You found some money? Show me!
",3225324,Zoidberg," Awwww...
",1025325,Farnsworth," Say, check out the money I found! It fell off a chump! 
",5725326,Leela," Hey, Professor, couldn't you go back in time as far as you want by pressing the button over and over?
",10325327,Farnsworth," Certainly not! Each time the button sends you back 10 seconds, it takes 10 seconds to recharge!  There. It's recharged.
",12125328,Zoidberg," Awwww...
",1025329,Bender," Again! Again!
",1525330,Fry," Uh, question. What if you had a special moment that you wish could go on forever? Could the time button make it last as long as you wanted?
",14125331,Farnsworth," Hell no! This button is for scientific use only!
",5025332,Zoidberg," Awwww...
",1025333,Fry," Uh, yes, I'd like an engagement diamond, please.
",5025334,Ultra Guy," You've come to the right joint, Ace!
",3825335,Fry," I'll take...this one.
",2325336,Ultra Guy," Classy choice, chief! She'll crap her pants!  That'll be five bills.  Hey, gimme back my stones!
",9825337,Fry," Hello, stranger! This is my first time here! Do you sell diamonds?
",6825338,Ultra Guy," You've come to the right joint, Ace!
",3825339,Fry," I guess what I'm saying is, the next time you almost die, I want it to be as my wife!  The clam, Elzar.
",10525340,Elzar," Clam, bam, thank you, ma'am!
",3025341,Leela," Fry?  Wow!
",1225342,Fry," Leela...my love... will youâ€”
",3025343,Leela," AAAAAAHHHH!!!
",1525344,Petunia," I'll have what she's havin'.
