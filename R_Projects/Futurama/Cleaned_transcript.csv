",47,1,1,1,Fry,Fry44,Fry," Y'know, I guess it should be but, actually, I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.

",79,1,1,1,Leela,Leela86,Leela," Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him.
",104,1,1,1,Ipgee,Ipgee87,Ipgee," Well that's your job, whether you like it or not. And it's my job to make you do your job whether I like it or not, which I do, very much! Now get to work!  Life is good!
",172,1,1,1,Leela,Fry88,Fry," Why would a robot need to drink?
",34,1,1,1,Ipgee,Bender89,Bender," I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want!  So they made you a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job.
",120,1,1,1,Fry,Fry90,Fry," Really? What do you do, Bender?
",33,1,1,1,Bender,Bender91,Bender," I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.
",64,1,1,1,Fry,Fry92,Fry," You any good at it?
",21,1,1,1,Bender,Bender93,Bender," You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle: 30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it!  31.  But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for.
",179,1,1,1,Fry,Fry94,Fry," What?
",7,1,1,1,Bender,Bender95,Bender," Suicide booths!  Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you. I'm gonna go kill myself.
",86,1,1,1,Fry,Fry96,Fry," Wait! You're the only friend I have!
",38,1,1,1,Bender,Bender97,Bender," You really want a robot for a friend?
",39,1,1,1,Fry,Fry98,Fry," Yeah, ever since I was six.
",29,1,1,1,Bender,Bender99,Bender," Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals. So, if anyone asks, you're my debugger.

",90,1,1,1,Bender,Bender129,Bender," Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?
",111,1,1,1,Fry,Fry130,Fry," Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
",103,1,1,1,Bender,Bender131,Bender," I'll have to check my program ... yep.

",33,1,1,1,Bender,Bender136,Bender," Can't ... I ... can't ... do ... it!
",38,1,1,1,Fry,Fry137,Fry," Yes!
",6,1,1,1,Bender,Bender138,Bender," You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when I want, who I want! I'm unstoppable!

",32,1,1,1,Bender,Leela140,Leela," Wait!
",7,1,1,1,Fry,Bender141,Bender,"  No, thanks.

",29,1,1,1,Fry,Fry147,Fry," This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
",63,1,1,1,Bender,Fry148,Fry," My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
",66,1,1,1,Fry,Bender149,Bender," Wait! There's someone you know!
",33,1,1,1,Fry,Fry150,Fry," Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already.
",61,1,1,1,Bender,Leela151,Leela," Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel.
",71,1,1,1,Fry,Fry152,Fry," No, you don't. I've got no home, no family--
",46,1,1,1,Leela,Bender153,Bender," No friends.
",13,1,1,1,Fry,Fry154,Fry," My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.
",90,1,1,1,Bender,Leela155,Leela," I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.
",187,1,1,1,Fry,Fry156,Fry," Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it.  Your chip. What are you doing?
",172,1,1,1,Leela,Leela157,Leela," Quitting.
",11,1,1,1,Fry,Fry158,Fry," Why?
",6,1,1,1,Leela,Leela159,Leela," Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.
",75,1,1,1,Fry,Fry160,Fry," What is the matter with you?
",30,1,1,1,Leela,Bender161,Bender," I just wanted to be part of the moment.
",41,1,1,1,Fry,Leela162,Leela," Hey! He stole my ring!
",24,1,1,1,Bender,Bender163,Bender," Sorry.  Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink.
",84,1,1,1,Leela,Leela164,Leela," I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed and we have nowhere to go.
",108,1,1,1,Bender,Fry165,Fry," Correction: We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to mooch off of.

",14,1,1,1,Clark,Fry168,Fry," I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.

",30,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth176,Farnsworth," I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.
",85,1,1,1,Fry,Smitty177,Smitty,"  Attention, job deserters! Come out with your hands up. We have you partially surrounded.
",91,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Fry178,Fry," No!

",17,1,1,1,Fry,Bender180,Bender," Well, we're boned!
",20,1,1,1,Nixon,Leela181,Leela," Can't we get away in the ship?

",13,1,1,1,Fry,Smitty199,Smitty," I can't see nothing. Pretty though!
",37,1,1,1,Nixon,Fry200,Fry," So, I guess, without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever.
",56,1,1,1,Smitty,Farnsworth201,Farnsworth," Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship crew?
",94,1,1,1,Fry,Bender202,Bender," New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
",44,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth203,Farnsworth," Of those poor sons of-- But that's not important. The important thing is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?
",112,1,1,1,Bender,Fry204,Fry," Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!
",54,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Leela205,Leela," Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips.
",77,1,1,1,Fry,Farnsworth206,Farnsworth," Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it, I saved the chips from my previous crew.
",94,1,1,1,Leela,Fry207,Fry," This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?
",102,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth208,Farnsworth," If by that you mean ""transporting cargo"" then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research.

",31,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth210,Farnsworth," You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.
",78,1,1,1,Fry,Fry211,Fry," So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?
",34,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth212,Farnsworth," Exactly!
",10,1,1,1,Fry,Fry213,Fry," Alright! I'm a delivery boy!

",122,2,1,2,H.G. Blob,Evans222,Evans,"  Here's your package, Mr. Horrible Gelatinous Blob.
",53,2,1,2,Announcer #1,H.G. Blob223,H.G. Blob,"  Good work, Evans! You've got a future around here.
",53,2,1,2,Evans,Evans224,Evans,"  Thank you, sir!
",18,2,1,2,H.G. Blob,Announcer #1225,Announcer #1,"  Planet Express: Our crew is replaceable. Your package isn't.
",63,2,1,2,Evans,Fry226,Fry," Are there really giant birds like that?
",41,2,1,2,Announcer #1,Farnsworth227,Farnsworth," No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone likes eggs.
",98,2,1,2,Fry,Fry228,Fry," I'm never going to get used to the 31st century.  Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?
",107,2,1,2,Farnsworth,Leela229,Leela," Well, if you don't like that, try some Archduke Chocula.
",58,2,1,2,Fry,Farnsworth230,Farnsworth," Ah, Hermes! Crew, meet Hermes Conrad. He manages my delivery business, pays the bills, notifies next of kin, what have you.
",125,2,1,2,Leela,Hermes231,Hermes," Someone come and dropped this package through the slot last night. Now which one of you is the captain?
",105,2,1,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth232,Farnsworth," Oh, my! I haven't picked a new captain yet. It's always so hard to choose.
",76,2,1,2,Hermes,Fry233,Fry," Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!
",21,2,1,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth234,Farnsworth," Hmm, you!
",11,2,1,2,Fry,Hermes235,Hermes," OK, Captain, this is just a standard legal release protecting Planet Express from lawsuits in the event of the unforeseen.
",124,2,1,2,Farnsworth,Leela236,Leela,"  Death by airlock failure.
",28,2,1,2,Hermes,Hermes237,Hermes," Mm.
",5,2,1,2,Leela,Leela238,Leela,"  Death by brain parasite.
",27,2,1,2,Hermes,Hermes239,Hermes," Yeah.
",7,2,1,2,Leela,Leela240,Leela,"  Death by sonic diarrhoea?
",28,2,1,2,Hermes,Hermes241,Hermes,"  Oh, you don't want that!
",27,2,1,2,Leela,Leela242,Leela," Look, I don't know about any of your previous captains but I intend to do as little dying as possible.
",104,2,1,2,Hermes,Hermes243,Hermes," Sign the paper!
",17,2,1,2,Leela,Farnsworth244,Farnsworth," Now, Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor. I should warn you though, he's a little ... unusual.  He wears sandals!
",145,2,1,2,Hermes,Fry245,Fry," Hi--
",6,2,1,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth246,Farnsworth," Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery boy. He needs a physical.
",71,2,1,2,Fry,Zoidberg247,Zoidberg," Excellent, excellent!
",23,2,1,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth248,Farnsworth," You'll be fine.
",17,2,1,2,Zoidberg,Zoidberg249,Zoidberg," Now open your mouth and let's have a look at that brain.  No, no, no, no, no, not that mouth!
",95,2,1,2,Farnsworth,Fry250,Fry," I only have one.
",18,2,1,2,Zoidberg,Zoidberg251,Zoidberg," Really?
",9,2,1,2,Fry,Fry252,Fry," Uh, is there a human doctor around?
",37,2,1,2,Zoidberg,Zoidberg253,Zoidberg," Young lady, I'm an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say...  What? My mother was a saint! Get out!
",114,2,1,2,Fry,Farnsworth254,Farnsworth," Dear Lord, Bender, you're filthy.
",35,2,1,2,Zoidberg,Bender255,Bender," Yeah, like you don't have crap in your neck!
",46,2,1,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth256,Farnsworth," Amy, why don't you give his body a going over with the cleaning pick?
",71,2,1,2,Bender,Amy257,Amy," OK. Does it hurt when I go like this?
",39,2,1,2,Farnsworth,Leela258,Leela," Ow!
",5,2,1,2,Amy,Bender259,Bender," A little.
",11,2,1,2,Leela,Fry260,Fry," Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?
",74,2,1,2,Bender,Farnsworth261,Farnsworth," As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy Wong. She's an engineering student of mine.  I like having her around because she's the same blood type as me.
",187,2,1,2,Fry,Amy262,Amy," Hey! You're the unfrozen guy! From the 20th century, right?
",61,2,1,2,Farnsworth,Fry263,Fry,"  Last time I checked.
",23,2,1,2,Amy,Leela264,Leela," Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?
",39,2,1,2,Fry,Amy265,Amy," Look, we're not as rich as everybody says.
",44,2,1,2,Leela,Leela266,Leela," Uh-huh! What sorority do you belong to?
",41,2,1,2,Amy,Amy267,Amy,"  Kappa Kappa Wong.
",20,2,1,2,Leela,Bender268,Bender," Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining.   Look at my head. It's all painted! Look at my head! I got a big, old head, hey! Ho!   Alright, show's over, I'm tired.
",195,2,1,2,Amy,Farnsworth269,Farnsworth," Ah, to be young again. And also a robot. Now, as I recall, you youngsters have a package to deliver.
",102,2,1,2,Bender,Fry270,Fry," Finally! Come on, Bender. Let's mosey!
",40,2,1,2,Farnsworth,Bender271,Bender," Nice catch, idiot!
",20,2,1,2,Fry,Fry272,Fry," So where are we going anyway?
",31,2,1,2,Bender,Leela273,Leela," Nowhere special. The moon.
",28,2,1,2,Fry,Fry274,Fry," The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!
",132,2,1,2,Leela,Amy275,Amy," Oh, I love stuff like the moon! Can I come, Leela?
",52,2,1,2,Fry,Leela276,Leela," Well ... I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screw-ups until at least my second day as captain.
",121,2,1,2,Amy,Farnsworth277,Farnsworth," Nothing will go wrong.   If something goes wrong, bring back the blood.
",73,2,1,2,Leela,Fry278,Fry," Can I do the countdown?
",25,2,1,2,Farnsworth,Leela279,Leela," Huh? Oh, sure. Knock yourself out.
",36,2,1,2,Fry,Fry280,Fry," Ten ...  ... nine--
",21,2,1,2,Leela,Leela281,Leela," OK, we're here!
",17,2,1,2,Fry,Fry282,Fry,"  Eightsevensixfivefourthreetwooneblastoff!
",44,2,1,2,Leela,Fry283,Fry," Hurry up! I wanna see the moon!
",33,2,1,2,Fry,Leela284,Leela," Relax. It's open till 9.
",26,2,1,2,Fry,Fry285,Fry," That's one small step for Fry--
",33,2,1,2,Leela,Man #1286,Man #1," And one giant line for admission!
",35,2,1,2,Fry,Fry287,Fry," Wow!  Um, can I have cuts?
",28,2,1,2,Man #1,Man #1288,Man #1," Hmm ... no!
",13,2,1,2,Fry,Fry289,Fry," You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!
",78,2,1,2,Man #1,Amy290,Amy," Guh! It's the happiest place orbiting Earth.
",46,2,1,2,Fry,Fry291,Fry," Let's go, already!
",20,2,1,2,Amy,Leela292,Leela," Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
",34,2,1,2,Fry,Fry293,Fry," Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
",58,2,1,2,Leela,Bender294,Bender," Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
",65,2,1,2,Fry,Leela295,Leela," OK, if everyone's finished being stupid--
",43,2,1,2,Bender,Fry296,Fry," I had more but you go ahead.
",30,2,1,2,Leela,Leela297,Leela," We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.
",69,2,1,2,Fry,Fry298,Fry," But I've never been to the moon before.
",41,2,1,2,Leela,Leela299,Leela," Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals ... and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.  Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate. Then lock up when you're done. Just be careful.
",197,2,1,2,Fry,Amy300,Amy," Aye, aye, Captain! I mean only one eye. I mean, yes, sir-- Um, ma'am!
",71,2,1,2,Leela,Amy301,Amy," Clear?
",8,2,1,2,Amy,Fry302,Fry," Clear!
",8,2,1,2,Amy,Amy303,Amy," Ready to hoist?
",17,2,1,2,Fry,Fry304,Fry," Ready!
",8,2,1,2,Amy,Amy305,Amy," Ow!
",5,2,1,2,Fry,Fry306,Fry," My first space delivery.
",26,2,1,2,Amy,Fry307,Fry," Uh, greetings, Moon Man. We come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth.
",76,2,1,2,Fry,Sal308,Sal," Wise guy, huh? If I wasn't so lazy I'd punch you in the stomach.
",66,2,1,2,Fry,Fry309,Fry," But you are lazy, right?
",26,2,1,2,Sal,Sal310,Sal," Oh, don't get me started.
",27,2,1,2,Fry,Craterface311,Craterface," Hi, I'm Craterface! Welcome to Luna Park. I'll have to confiscate your alcohol, sir.
",86,2,1,2,Sal,Bender312,Bender," Better mascots than you have tried.
",37,2,1,2,Craterface,Craterface313,Craterface," At least I still have my self respect!
",40,2,1,2,Bender,Leela314,Leela," Who buys this trash?
",22,2,1,2,Craterface,Bender315,Bender," Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.
",41,2,1,2,Leela,Fry316,Fry," Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets.
",43,2,1,2,Bender,Bender317,Bender," Get it off! Get it off! Get it-- Uh-oh!   How many roads must a man walk down, before you--   Keep those things off of me! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit!
",161,2,1,2,Fry,Fry318,Fry," So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?
",63,2,1,2,Bender,Bender319,Bender," Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna be a folk singer.
",72,2,1,2,Fry,Whalerbots320,Whalerbots,"  We're whalers on the moon,
We carry a harpoon,
But there ain't no whales,
So we tell our tall tale,
And sing our whaling tune!
",129,2,1,2,Bender,Whalerbot321,Whalerbot," Bender, hey, Bender! Over here!
",33,2,1,2,Whalerbots,Bender322,Bender," Oh, jeez! I went to high school with that guy!
",48,2,1,2,Whalerbot,Announcer #1323,Announcer #1," Monsanto presents: The Goophy Gopher Revue!
",45,2,1,2,Bender,Gopher #1324,Gopher #1," Why does a moon rock taste better than an Earth rock?
",55,2,1,2,Announcer #1,Gopher #2325,Gopher #2," Because it's a little meteor!
",31,2,1,2,Gopher #1,Fry326,Fry," This is weak!
",15,2,1,2,Gopher #2,Gopher #1327,Gopher #1," Address all complaints to the Monsanto corporation.
",53,2,1,2,Fry,Leela328,Leela," What's wrong, Fry?
",20,2,1,2,Gopher #1,Fry329,Fry," I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial. The gravity, the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth.  That's what I came to see! I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut. Screw this phoney stuff!
",248,2,1,2,Leela,Leela330,Leela," But the phoney stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there.
",60,2,1,2,Fry,Bender331,Bender," Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to see the Sexeteria!
",90,2,1,2,Leela,Leela332,Leela," Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space suit and drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.
",158,2,1,2,Bender,Fry333,Fry," I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!
",50,2,1,2,Leela,Bender334,Bender,"  Next year in Jerusalem!
",26,2,1,2,Fry,Fry335,Fry," Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.
",50,2,1,2,Bender,Narrator336,Narrator,"  The story of lunar exploration started with one man. A man with a dream.
",75,2,1,2,Fry,Ralph Kramden-bot337,Ralph Kramden-bot," One of these days, Alice. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon!
",61,2,1,2,Narrator,Leela338,Leela," Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!
",57,2,1,2,Ralph Kramden-bot,Fry339,Fry," That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.
",117,2,1,2,Leela,Amy340,Amy," Wow! I could swear I was really playing virtual skeeball!  Hm?
",64,2,1,2,Fry,Bender341,Bender," Look, it's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer.
",57,2,1,2,Amy,Amy342,Amy," The keys to the ship!  They must have fallen into the crate! Leela's gonna kill me!
",85,2,1,2,Bender,Bender343,Bender," Nah. She'll probably make me do it.
",37,2,1,2,Amy,Amy344,Amy," Mister? Could you please get those keys out for me?
",53,2,1,2,Bender,Sal345,Sal," What do I look like? A guy who's not lazy?
",44,2,1,2,Amy,Narrator346,Narrator,"  No one knows where, when or how Man first landed on the moon.
",64,2,1,2,Sal,Fry347,Fry," I do.
",7,2,1,2,Narrator,Narrator348,Narrator,"  But our fun-gineers think it might have happened something like this:
",72,2,1,2,Fry,Whalerbots349,Whalerbots,"  We're whalers on the moon,
",29,2,1,2,Narrator,Gophers350,Gophers,"  We carry a harpoon,
",22,2,1,2,Whalerbots,Whalerbots351,Whalerbots," and   But there ain't no whales so we tell a tall tale...
",59,2,1,2,Gophers,Leela352,Leela,"  And sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon--
",55,2,1,2,Whalerbots,Fry353,Fry," That's not how it happened.
",29,2,1,2,Leela,Leela354,Leela," Oh, really? I don't see you with a fun-gineering degree!
",58,2,1,2,Fry,Fry355,Fry," This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.
",61,2,1,2,Leela,Leela356,Leela," Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides, the car's on a track.
",111,2,1,2,Fry,Fry357,Fry," Not for long!
",15,2,1,2,Leela,Whalerbot358,Whalerbot," Ooh! Ah! I died doin' what I loved.
",37,2,1,2,Fry,Leela359,Leela," OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?
",138,2,1,2,Whalerbot,Fry360,Fry," Agreed.  Yeah! Crank up the radio!
",36,2,1,2,Leela,Whalerbots361,Whalerbots,"  We're whalers on the--
",25,2,1,2,Fry,Fry362,Fry," Yee-haw!
",10,2,1,2,Whalerbots,Leela363,Leela," Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.
",46,2,1,2,Fry,Fry364,Fry," No, not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?
",71,2,1,2,Leela,Leela365,Leela," That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!
",45,2,1,2,Fry,Fry366,Fry," Well I'm feelin' lucky!  Uh ... I'm ready to go back now.
",59,2,1,2,Leela,Fry367,Fry," We're gonna die! It's every man for himself!  Help me, Leela!  You did it! We're safe!
",88,2,1,2,Fry,Leela368,Leela," No. Now we're gonna die.
",26,2,1,2,Fry,Fry369,Fry," It's every man for himself.
",29,2,1,2,Leela,Bender370,Bender," Hey, look what I won from a tourist's pocket!
",47,2,1,2,Fry,Amy371,Amy," Shut up. You're distracting me.
",33,2,1,2,Bender,Bender372,Bender," Come on, it's just like making love. Y'know: Left, down, rotate 62 degrees, engage rotor.
",91,2,1,2,Amy,Amy373,Amy," I know how to make love!
",26,2,1,2,Bender,Bender374,Bender," Here, let me do it.  Ah, lousy arm. Must be rigged!  That's her, officers!  Uh, that's the woman who programmed me for evil!
",126,2,1,2,Amy,Bender375,Bender," Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!
",105,2,1,2,Bender,Fry376,Fry,"  I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that barn over there.
",93,2,1,2,Bender,Leela377,Leela," Thank God!
",12,2,1,2,Fry,Hydroponic Farmer378,Hydroponic Farmer," Trespassers, eh?
",18,2,1,2,Leela,Fry379,Fry," No, sir. We're amusement park patrons.
",40,2,1,2,Hydroponic Farmer,Farmer380,Farmer," Ooh, that's a wicked sinful place. Tilt-a-whirl's OK, but the rest is mighty wicked.
",86,2,1,2,Fry,Leela381,Leela," Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?
",65,2,1,2,Farmer,Farmer382,Farmer," Huh, borry? Looky here, city girl, oxygen don't grow on trees. You'll have to earn it doing chores on my hydroponic farm. You can go back to your precious theme park at sun up.
",178,2,1,2,Leela,Fry383,Fry," I guess we could do chores for a few hours.
",45,2,1,2,Farmer,Leela384,Leela," Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon.
",41,2,1,2,Fry,Farmer385,Farmer," Yup. Drops down to -173!
",26,2,1,2,Leela,Fry386,Fry," Fahrenheit or Celsius?
",24,2,1,2,Farmer,Farmer387,Farmer," First one, then th'other. And them spacesuits ain't a-heated so you ain't goin' nowhere till sunrise. You can sleep in the barn. Just don't be a-touchin' my three beautiful robot daughters. Y'hear?
",199,2,1,2,Fry,Fry388,Fry," Robot daughters?
",18,2,1,2,Farmer,Farmer389,Farmer," This here is Lulabelle 7.
",27,2,1,2,Fry,Lulabelle 7390,Lulabelle 7," Yoo-hoo!
",10,2,1,2,Farmer,Farmer391,Farmer," Daisy-Mae 128K.
",17,2,1,2,Lulabelle 7,Daisy-Mae K392,Daisy-Mae K," Yoo-hoo!
",10,2,1,2,Farmer,Farmer393,Farmer," And the Crushinator.
",22,2,1,2,Daisy-Mae K,Crushinator394,Crushinator,"  Yoo-hoo.
",11,2,1,2,Farmer,Fry395,Fry," Whoa!
",7,2,1,2,Crushinator,Leela396,Leela," I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too phoney. We had to see the real moon.
",118,2,1,2,Fry,Fry397,Fry," And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and ... and these fellas.
",132,2,1,2,Leela,Leela398,Leela," Fry, face it: The moon is a dump. It's a boring, dried-up wasteland and the only reason anybody ever comes here is for the tacky little amusement park. Can't you just accept that?
",181,2,1,2,Fry,Fry399,Fry," I guess I can't.
",18,2,1,2,Leela,Farmer400,Farmer," I'll learn ye to sleep with my robot daughters!
",49,2,1,2,Fry,Bender401,Bender," He'll never find me in here.
",30,2,1,2,Farmer,Leela402,Leela," Bender?
",9,2,1,2,Bender,Fry403,Fry," Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?
",56,2,1,2,Leela,Bender404,Bender," Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.
",58,2,1,2,Fry,Farmer405,Farmer," Oh, no you don't! C'mere, Crushinator.
",40,2,1,2,Bender,Crushinator406,Crushinator,"  Yes, Pa.
",11,2,1,2,Farmer,Fry407,Fry," It's too low.
",15,2,1,2,Crushinator,Leela408,Leela," Hang on. Hang on. Jump!  Hold on to your helmet!
",50,2,1,2,Fry,Farmer409,Farmer," God darn it, Crushinator, jump!
",33,2,1,2,Leela,Crushinator410,Crushinator,"  No, Pa. I love him.
",22,2,1,2,Farmer,Fry411,Fry," Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!
",35,2,1,2,Crushinator,Leela412,Leela," Nightfall's coming.  Hurry, before we freeze.
",47,2,1,2,Fry,Bender413,Bender," What do you mean ""we"", mammal?
",32,2,1,2,Leela,Farnsworth414,Farnsworth," Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas.
",75,2,1,2,Bender,Leela415,Leela," We can't outrun it forever.
",29,2,1,2,Farnsworth,Fry416,Fry," Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!
",60,2,1,2,Leela,Leela417,Leela," Quick, get in.
",16,2,1,2,Fry,Fry418,Fry," It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint!  Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?
",137,2,1,2,Leela,Leela419,Leela," Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks in the dust.  Now get in here before you freeze.
",124,2,1,2,Fry,Bender420,Bender," Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole thing.
",178,2,1,2,Leela,Leela421,Leela," Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.
",76,2,1,2,Bender,Fry422,Fry," Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here.
",67,2,1,2,Leela,Leela423,Leela," That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is.
",81,2,1,2,Fry,Fry424,Fry," I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.
",241,2,1,2,Leela,Leela425,Leela," A week would be a little much.
",32,2,1,2,Fry,Fry426,Fry," The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to.  But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to.
",299,2,1,2,Leela,Leela427,Leela," Fry, look. . It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before.
",79,2,1,2,Fry,Farmer428,Farmer," Had to come back for the Crushinator, eh, robot? Well I got you this time.
",76,2,1,2,Leela,Fry429,Fry," It's Amy! We're saved!
",24,2,1,2,Farmer,Leela430,Leela," Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?
",59,2,1,2,Fry,Bender431,Bender," Not the magnet! No! No! No--  Uh-oh!
",38,2,1,2,Leela,Bender432,Bender,"  She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes,
She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes--
 I'll kill you Amy!
 She'll be comin' round the mountain,
She'll be comin' round the mountain,
She'll be comin'--
",221,2,1,2,Bender,Farmer433,Farmer," Aw, dang it!
",14,2,1,2,Bender,Bender434,Bender,"  She'll be riding six white horses when she comes,
She'll be riding six white horses when she comes--
 Hey, I'm pretty good!
 She'll be riding six white horses...
",164,2,1,2,Farmer,Leela435,Leela,"  So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?
",77,2,1,2,Bender,Fry436,Fry,"  Well ... close enough!
",25,2,1,2,Leela,Bender437,Bender,"  Well I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,
Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,
Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun,
Oh, I'll shoot her with my ray gun,
Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,
When she comes!
I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world,
I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world, 
I'll be blastin' all the humans, 
I'll be blastin' all the humans, 
I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world,
In the world!
 One more time!
",484,2,1,2,Fry,Bender438,Bender," Hey!
",6,3,1,3,Bender,Hermes439,Hermes," Fry, mon, if you're going to be living in the office you could at least be on time for work.
",94,3,1,3,Bender,Fry440,Fry," I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.
",64,3,1,3,Hermes,Hermes441,Hermes," Alright, people. I will now outline today's 12-point agenda. We'll begin with point one, then race forward--
",110,3,1,3,Fry,Hermes442,Hermes," Concerning our pest problem: Somebody's been leaving food around and it's attracting owls. And I, for one, am getting tired of cleaning those owl traps.  Now...  As this shocking graph indicates, our water consumption has tripled in the last month. I notice Fry has been here for a month, so I'm appointing him head of a committee to find who's responsible. Fry?  Am I cracking up, or is Fry's living here starting to get in the way of bus--
",443,3,1,3,Hermes,Leela443,Leela," What the hell are you doing? You're getting a huge dose of radiation!
",71,3,1,3,Hermes,Fry444,Fry,"  And great lift!
",18,3,1,3,Leela,Leela445,Leela," Do you know how long it's going to take me to recalibrate these engines?
",74,3,1,3,Fry,Fry446,Fry," Hey! When you look this good, you don't have to know anything.
",64,3,1,3,Leela,Leela447,Leela," Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry.
",46,3,1,3,Fry,Bender448,Bender," That's right, we want some moneyâ€” Wait. What's this about Fry?
",64,3,1,3,Leela,Leela449,Leela," He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.
",68,3,1,3,Bender,Farnsworth450,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy.  This sarcophagus should contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zuban 5 over 29 million years ago.
",232,3,1,3,Leela,Fry451,Fry," Hey, Professor, great jerky!
",30,3,1,3,Farnsworth,Farnsworth452,Farnsworth," My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy! Fry has got to go!
",79,3,1,3,Fry,Announcer #1453,Announcer #1,"  Bachelor Chow, now with flavour!
",35,3,1,3,Farnsworth,Commentator454,Commentator,"  And Bigfoot is down!
",23,3,1,3,Announcer #1,Fry455,Fry," Sheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 have anything good on.
",61,3,1,3,Commentator,Announcer #1456,Announcer #1,"  All My Circuits is brought to you by Robo Fresh: Designed by a robot, for a robot.
",85,3,1,3,Fry,Calculon457,Calculon,"  I've been processing this for some time, Monique, and, well, will you marry me?
",82,3,1,3,Announcer #1,Monique458,Monique,"  Oh, Calculon!  It fits! Then you must know that I'm--
",56,3,1,3,Calculon,Calculon459,Calculon,"  Metric? I've always known. But for you, my darling, I'm willing to convert.
",78,3,1,3,Monique,Fry460,Fry," Hmm, must be a friend of theirs.
",34,3,1,3,Calculon,Bender461,Bender," Fry, we've got to discuss your living arrangements.
",53,3,1,3,Fry,Leela462,Leela," We've all talked it over and--
",32,3,1,3,Bender,Bender463,Bender," Hey, All My Circuits! Move over.
",34,3,1,3,Leela,Leela464,Leela," Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without realising it.
",88,3,1,3,Bender,Fry465,Fry," I know but I forgive you.
",27,3,1,3,Leela,Leela466,Leela," No, Fry, by ""close quarters"" I mean this office--
",51,3,1,3,Fry,Fry467,Fry," Uh-huh.
",9,3,1,3,Leela,Leela468,Leela," And by ""people"" I mean you!
",29,3,1,3,Fry,Fry469,Fry," Right.
",8,3,1,3,Leela,Leela470,Leela," And by ""inconsiderate"" I mean--
",33,3,1,3,Fry,Fry471,Fry," Leela! We're trying to watch TV.
",34,3,1,3,Leela,Bender472,Bender," Yeah. Would you kindly shut your noise hole?
",46,3,1,3,Fry,Fry473,Fry," So, who's that weird-looking guy?
",35,3,1,3,Bender,Bender474,Bender," That's a human.
",17,3,1,3,Fry,Fry475,Fry," What's he do?
",15,3,1,3,Bender,Bender476,Bender," Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves.
",60,3,1,3,Fry,Fry477,Fry," Boring!
",9,3,1,3,Bender,Human Friend478,Human Friend,"  Calculon? I thought you were in a coma.
",42,3,1,3,Fry,Calculon479,Calculon,"  That's what I wanted you to think with your soft, human brain.
",65,3,1,3,Human Friend,Fry480,Fry," Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?
",41,3,1,3,Calculon,Hermes481,Hermes," We'll bill you for the couch.
",31,3,1,3,Fry,Bender482,Bender," Cheer up, meatbag. You've barely touched your amoeba.
",55,3,1,3,Hermes,Fry483,Fry," It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?
",64,3,1,3,Bender,Bender484,Bender," Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol.  The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged.
",134,3,1,3,Fry,Fry485,Fry," What are the cigars for?
",26,3,1,3,Bender,Bender486,Bender," They make me look cool.
",25,3,1,3,Fry,Fry487,Fry," I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.
",90,3,1,3,Bender,Bender488,Bender," Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk.  That's my philosophy. So, where you gonna stay?
",100,3,1,3,Fry,Fry489,Fry," I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?
",63,3,1,3,Bender,Bender490,Bender," Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?
",78,3,1,3,Fry,Fry491,Fry," Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?
",56,3,1,3,Bender,Bender492,Bender," Nah, I've always wanted a pet.
",32,3,1,3,Fry,Bender493,Bender," Here we are. Your new home.
",29,3,1,3,Bender,Fry494,Fry," Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before.
",64,3,1,3,Bender,Bender495,Bender," Come on in, I'll give you the tour!
",37,3,1,3,Fry,Bender496,Bender," Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's the breakfast nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because, until now, it's just been wasted space.
",195,3,1,3,Bender,Fry497,Fry," It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.
",72,3,1,3,Bender,Bender498,Bender," Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night.
",121,3,1,3,Fry,Fry499,Fry," Wait, Bender. Bender?
",23,3,1,3,Bender,Bender500,Bender,"  Kill all humans ... kill all humans ... must kill all the humans.
",68,3,1,3,Fry,Fry501,Fry," Bender, wake up!
",18,3,1,3,Bender,Bender502,Bender," I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
",64,3,1,3,Fry,Fry503,Fry," Uh, listen, Bender. Uh, where's your bathroom?
",48,3,1,3,Bender,Bender504,Bender," Bath what?
",12,3,1,3,Fry,Fry505,Fry," Bathroom.
",11,3,1,3,Bender,Bender506,Bender," What room?
",12,3,1,3,Fry,Fry507,Fry," Bathroom!
",11,3,1,3,Bender,Bender508,Bender," What what?
",12,3,1,3,Fry,Fry509,Fry," Ah, never mind!
",17,3,1,3,Bender,Bender510,Bender,"  Hey, sexy mama, wanna kill all the humans?
",45,3,1,3,Fry,Leela511,Leela," We sure are cheerful this morning.
",36,3,1,3,Bender,Bender512,Bender," Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.
",134,3,1,3,Leela,Leela513,Leela," What happened to you?
",23,3,1,3,Bender,Fry514,Fry," Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle?  Now you're OK.
",163,3,1,3,Leela,Leela515,Leela," Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to live.
",75,3,1,3,Fry,Fry516,Fry,"  Is that an invitation?
",25,3,1,3,Leela,Leela517,Leela," Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're moving out.
",86,3,1,3,Fry,Fry518,Fry," Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him.
",75,3,1,3,Leela,Bender519,Bender," Hey, there's my little space heater.
",38,3,1,3,Fry,Fry520,Fry," Well, I'm moving out!
",23,3,1,3,Bender,Bender521,Bender," What?
",7,3,1,3,Fry,Fry522,Fry," I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room.
",54,3,1,3,Bender,Bender523,Bender," Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5 cubic metres. We've got room for a-whole-nother two-thirds of a person.
",143,3,1,3,Fry,Leela524,Leela," What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?
",63,3,1,3,Bender,Bender525,Bender," I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place.  And now they're gone.
",88,3,1,3,Leela,Underwater House Salesman526,Underwater House Salesman," Sure, it ain't one of them la-de-da above-ground places. But if you like dank, hey, forget about it!
",102,3,1,3,Bender,Leela527,Leela," At least it's got a great view.
",33,3,1,3,Underwater House Salesman,Bender528,Bender," What the--?
",13,3,1,3,Leela,Underwater House Salesman #1529,Underwater House Salesman #1," Excuse me. I gotta go change a lightbulb.
",43,3,1,3,Bender,Leela530,Leela," Wow! Now this is fantastic!
",29,3,1,3,Underwater House Salesman #1,Fry531,Fry," Hmm. I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use.
",74,3,1,3,Leela,Fry532,Fry," Well, I give up. What's the catch?
",36,3,1,3,Fry,Suspiciously fantastic apartment salesman533,Suspiciously fantastic apartment salesman," Oh, no catch. Although we 'are technically in New Jersey.
",59,3,1,3,Fry,Fry534,Fry," Not one place even remotely liveable.
",39,3,1,3,Suspiciously fantastic apartment salesman,Farnsworth535,Farnsworth," Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? To shreds, you say. Very well then.  Sad, sad, terrible, gruesome news about my colleague, Dr. Mbutu.
",204,3,1,3,Fry,Leela536,Leela," Was his apartment rent-controlled?
",36,3,1,3,Farnsworth,Leela537,Leela," Wow. This is beautiful.
",25,3,1,3,Leela,Bender538,Bender," What's with all the crap?
",27,3,1,3,Leela,Leela539,Leela," It's not crap.
",16,3,1,3,Bender,Hattie McDoogal540,Hattie McDoogal," Dr. Mbutu collected this crap while he was exploring the watcha-call-it ... universe!
",87,3,1,3,Leela,Fry541,Fry," Well, this place has everything except the only thing I care about: A TV.
",75,3,1,3,Hattie McDoogal,Hattie McDoogal542,Hattie McDoogal," It's got a TV, you young watcha-call-it ... idiot!
",52,3,1,3,Fry,Fry543,Fry," Ooh!
",6,3,1,3,Hattie McDoogal,Bender544,Bender," Whoa, slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't ... cosy.  Ah. I can barely move!   It's perfect!
",122,3,1,3,Fry,Fry545,Fry," Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel like I'm home.
",86,3,1,3,Bender,Bender546,Bender," Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know, Fry, of all the friends I've had, you're the first.
",97,3,1,3,Fry,Hermes547,Hermes," Hey, mon!
",11,3,1,3,Bender,Leela548,Leela," Happy housewarming, Fry!  It's a miniature fruit salad tree.
",62,3,1,3,Hermes,Fry549,Fry," Ooh!  Hey, Amy!
",17,3,1,3,Leela,Amy550,Amy," Hey!
",6,3,1,3,Fry,Farnsworth551,Farnsworth," This is for you, Fry  Zevulon the Great. He's teriyaki style.
",63,3,1,3,Amy,Bender552,Bender," Wow! Heavy-drinking crowd!  I'd better go out for more beer.
",62,3,1,3,Farnsworth,Fry553,Fry," Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!
",50,3,1,3,Bender,Bender554,Bender," I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding doesn't go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained.
",144,3,1,3,Fry,Fry555,Fry," Hey!
",6,3,1,3,Bender,Hermes556,Hermes," These are mighty tasty!
",25,3,1,3,Fry,Zoidberg557,Zoidberg," Thank you. I made them myself.
",32,3,1,3,Hermes,Fry558,Fry," Sh! The wedding's about to start!
",35,3,1,3,Zoidberg,Preacherbot559,Preacherbot,"  If anyone here objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold theirâ€”
",82,3,1,3,Fry,Fry560,Fry," Is he objecting or backing up?
",32,3,1,3,Preacherbot,Amy561,Amy," Looks like both.
",18,3,1,3,Fry,Calculon562,Calculon,"  I'm afraid my half-brother is correct. You see, I have a terrible secret and that secret is--
",96,3,1,3,Amy,Amy563,Amy," Oh, this isn't right.
",23,3,1,3,Calculon,Hermes564,Hermes," Oh, come on!
",14,3,1,3,Amy,Farnsworth565,Farnsworth," Fix it!
",9,3,1,3,Hermes,Bender566,Bender," Hey, what happened to the TV?
",31,3,1,3,Farnsworth,Fry567,Fry," It just went out.
",19,3,1,3,Bender,Bender568,Bender," This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!
",55,3,1,3,Fry,Hermes569,Hermes," Alright!
",10,3,1,3,Bender,Fry570,Fry,"  Come back, Bender! It's working!
",35,3,1,3,Hermes,Calculon571,Calculon,"  To reiterate, my terrible secret is--
",40,3,1,3,Fry,Fry572,Fry," It's out again.
",17,3,1,3,Calculon,Bender573,Bender," What? That's the last straw!
",30,3,1,3,Fry,Fry574,Fry," It's back on!
",15,3,1,3,Bender,Hattie McDoogal575,Hattie McDoogal," Pardon me. I don't mean to pry into what you're doing in here with the crab and the one-eyed lady and the Chinese girl but everyone on this floor is having trouble with their TV reception.
",190,3,1,3,Fry,Bender576,Bender," Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta this dump!
",83,3,1,3,Hattie McDoogal,Hattie McDoogal577,Hattie McDoogal," Relax, sonny. This kajigger'll find the source of the interference.
",69,3,1,3,Bender,Tenant #1578,Tenant #1," What's going on?
",18,3,1,3,Hattie McDoogal,Tenant #2579,Tenant #2," We want our TV back!
",22,3,1,3,Tenant #1,Hattie McDoogal580,Hattie McDoogal," There's your problem.
",23,3,1,3,Tenant #2,Amy581,Amy," Oh, my God! Bender, it's your thingy!
",39,3,1,3,Hattie McDoogal,Randy582,Randy," Then get rid of it!
",21,3,1,3,Amy,Tenant #1583,Tenant #1," Get out!
",10,3,1,3,Randy,Bender584,Bender," You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.
",66,3,1,3,Tenant #1,Leela585,Leela," You had cable. This is satellite.
",35,3,1,3,Bender,Farnsworth586,Farnsworth," Obviously your thoughts are being transmitted on the same frequency.
",70,3,1,3,Leela,Huge-assed woman587,Huge-assed woman," They're on my cell phone too.
",31,3,1,3,Farnsworth,Bender588,Bender," Madam, I believe you're mistaken!
",35,3,1,3,Huge-assed woman,Bender589,Bender,"  Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!
",35,3,1,3,Bender,Bender590,Bender," Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat ass!
",44,3,1,3,Bender,Randy591,Randy," The robot has to go!
",22,3,1,3,Bender,Tenant #1592,Tenant #1," Yeah.
",7,3,1,3,Randy,Tenant #3593,Tenant #3," Get him out of here!
",22,3,1,3,Tenant #1,Hattie McDoogal594,Hattie McDoogal," Well, you heard the mob!
",26,3,1,3,Tenant #3,Bender595,Bender," Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You liked that one, right?
",104,3,1,3,Hattie McDoogal,Fry596,Fry," It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here.
",63,3,1,3,Bender,Bender597,Bender," Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!
",86,3,1,3,Fry,Fry598,Fry," Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?
",87,3,1,3,Bender,Bender599,Bender," I don't understand.
",21,3,1,3,Fry,Fry600,Fry," Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?
",100,3,1,3,Bender,Bender601,Bender," But, then we wouldn't be roommates.
",37,3,1,3,Fry,Fry602,Fry," I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.
",54,3,1,3,Bender,Hattie McDoogal603,Hattie McDoogal," No he can't.
",14,3,1,3,Fry,Fry604,Fry," Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy.
",64,3,1,3,Hattie McDoogal,Bender605,Bender,"  Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy.
",44,3,1,3,Fry,Randy606,Randy," Hey, the TV's back on!
",24,3,1,3,Bender,Preacherbot607,Preacherbot,"  We are gathered here to mourn the death of Calculon; industrialist, private eye, friend.
",91,3,1,3,Randy,Calculon608,Calculon,"  Mind if I give the eulogy?
",29,3,1,3,Preacherbot,Monique609,Monique,"  Calculon! You're alive!
",26,3,1,3,Calculon,Randy610,Randy," Calculon's back!
",18,3,1,3,Monique,Farnsworth611,Farnsworth," Right, so long.
",17,3,1,3,Randy,Zoidberg612,Zoidberg," Goodbye.
",10,3,1,3,Farnsworth,Amy613,Amy,"  Do you think Calculon's evil twin will ever walk again?
",58,3,1,3,Zoidberg,Hermes614,Hermes," I don't know, Amy. I just don't know.
",39,3,1,3,Amy,Fry615,Fry," Hey, thanks for coming.
",25,3,1,3,Hermes,Leela616,Leela," Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him out?
",76,3,1,3,Fry,Fry617,Fry," Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs.
",33,3,1,3,Leela,Leela618,Leela," Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.
",71,3,1,3,Fry,Fry619,Fry," Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.
",87,3,1,3,Leela,Leela620,Leela," Bender's not a guy, he's a robot.
",35,3,1,3,Fry,Fry621,Fry," Same thing.
",13,3,1,3,Leela,Bender622,Bender," It's so big and empty.
",24,3,1,3,Fry,Bender623,Bender," My roommate's gone. And all he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes.  Oh, what's the point?
",105,3,1,3,Bender,Leela624,Leela," Bender?  My God, you're a mess!
",33,3,1,3,Bender,Bender625,Bender," Leave me alone!
",17,3,1,3,Leela,Leela626,Leela," Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking, haven't you?
",85,3,1,3,Bender,Bender627,Bender," Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.
",48,3,1,3,Leela,Leela628,Leela," Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for the people who love you.
",94,3,1,3,Bender,Bender629,Bender," I hate the people who love me and they hate me.
",49,3,1,3,Leela,Leela630,Leela," Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's got to be a better way to deal with this.
",113,3,1,3,Bender,Bender631,Bender," Like how? Having my antenna removed?
",38,3,1,3,Leela,Leela632,Leela," Well, if that would work.
",27,3,1,3,Bender,Bender633,Bender," Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut it off. You're not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here.
",160,3,1,3,Leela,Leela634,Leela," Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.
",137,3,1,3,Bender,Bender635,Bender," I promise nothing!
",20,3,1,3,Leela,Fry636,Fry," What up?
",10,3,1,3,Bender,Leela637,Leela," I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.
",59,3,1,3,Fry,Fry638,Fry," Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.
",51,3,1,3,Leela,Leela639,Leela," Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere destroying himself.
",96,3,1,3,Fry,Fry640,Fry," Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.
",60,3,1,3,Leela,Leela641,Leela," He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back on him.
",91,3,1,3,Fry,Fry642,Fry," Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him.
",73,3,1,3,Leela,Fry643,Fry," Oh, stupid TV!  Bender! You're blind-stinking sober!
",54,3,1,3,Fry,Bender644,Bender," That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!
",69,3,1,3,Fry,Fry645,Fry," Don't do it!
",14,3,1,3,Bender,Bender646,Bender," I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again.
",157,3,1,3,Fry,Leela647,Leela," Bender! Stop!
",15,3,1,3,Bender,Fry648,Fry," Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!
",48,3,1,3,Leela,Bender649,Bender," No, I'm going to chop off my antenna.
",39,3,1,3,Fry,Fry650,Fry," Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?
",53,3,1,3,Bender,Leela651,Leela," Fry! Don't help him mutilate himself.
",39,3,1,3,Fry,Fry652,Fry," But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.
",74,3,1,3,Leela,Bender653,Bender," I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.
",76,3,1,3,Fry,Fry654,Fry," Hey, it works! The static's gone.
",35,3,1,3,Bender,Human Friend655,Human Friend,"  I hate that this came between us, Calculon.
",46,3,1,3,Fry,Calculon656,Calculon,"  Me too. I'm filled with a large number of powerful emotions.
",63,3,1,3,Human Friend,Human Friend657,Human Friend,"  You're my best friend. I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
",59,3,1,3,Calculon,Calculon658,Calculon,"  Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
",50,3,1,3,Human Friend,Leela659,Leela," You guys could learn a lesson from those two.
",47,3,1,3,Calculon,Fry660,Fry," She's right.
",14,3,1,3,Leela,Bender661,Bender," You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
",63,3,1,3,Fry,Fry662,Fry," Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
",49,3,1,3,Bender,Leela663,Leela," Wait a minute! You did it all backwards.  Fry's the one who should be--  Oh, never mind!
",90,3,1,3,Fry,Fry664,Fry," What's wrong?
",15,3,1,3,Leela,Bender665,Bender," Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.
",76,3,1,3,Fry,Fry666,Fry," Aw, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still reattach it?
",94,3,1,3,Bender,Bender667,Bender," Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.
",40,3,1,3,Fry,Smitty668,Smitty," Bingo!
",8,3,1,3,Bender,URL669,URL," You call that an antenna?
",27,3,1,3,Smitty,Bender670,Bender," This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, some food cookers, maybe a puppy.
",112,3,1,3,URL,Fry671,Fry," It's good to be home.
",23,3,1,3,Bender,Bender672,Bender," It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff.
",45,3,1,3,Fry,Fry673,Fry," So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?
",104,3,1,3,Bender,Bender674,Bender," There's a window in the closet.
",33,3,1,3,Fry,Fry675,Fry," This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?
",54,3,1,3,Bender,Bender676,Bender," In a closet? Oh, humans!
",26,3,1,3,Fry,Leela677,Leela," This place was a great choice. The food is amazing. And such generous portions.
",81,4,1,4,Bender,Doug678,Doug," You like the meal just wait until you try these after-dinner mints.
",69,4,1,4,Leela,Leela679,Leela," You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally meet someone who's open-minded.  Ew!
",108,4,1,4,Doug,Fry680,Fry," What was wrong with your date last night?
",43,4,1,4,Leela,Leela681,Leela," I don't know. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on. Possibly his vile lizard tongue.
",93,4,1,4,Fry,Amy682,Amy," You're too picky.
",19,4,1,4,Leela,Fry683,Fry," Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely.
",134,4,1,4,Amy,Leela684,Leela," There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Now can we please stop--
",76,4,1,4,Fry,Zoidberg685,Zoidberg," The female Leela's problem is purely medical. Soon she will drop her eggs and they will hatch and all will be well.
",117,4,1,4,Leela,Amy686,Amy," You just have to give guys a chance. Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's a pig, but then later you realise he actually has a really good body.
",148,4,1,4,Zoidberg,Leela687,Leela," Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the way it is.
",93,4,1,4,Amy,Bender688,Bender," That sounds like a cry for help.
",34,4,1,4,Leela,Amy689,Amy," Let's all take her out tonight. There's lots of great places to meet people.
",78,4,1,4,Bender,Hermes690,Hermes," The Federal Sex Bureau.
",25,4,1,4,Amy,Bender691,Bender," A saucy puppet show.
",22,4,1,4,Hermes,Zoidberg692,Zoidberg," The rotting carcass of a whale.
",33,4,1,4,Bender,Amy693,Amy," Hmm, I'll pick!
",17,4,1,4,Zoidberg,Amy694,Amy," Oh, wow! It's totally retro!
",30,4,1,4,Amy,Fry695,Fry," Why's everyone wearing those rings?
",37,4,1,4,Amy,Amy696,Amy," Guh! Because nobody wears them anymore! Rings are stupid!
",59,4,1,4,Fry,Fry697,Fry," I think they look cool.
",25,4,1,4,Amy,Amy698,Amy," Sh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!
",41,4,1,4,Fry,Man #1699,Man #1," Hey, did that guy just say rings are cool?
",44,4,1,4,Amy,Amy700,Amy," Nope, he said they're stupid.
",31,4,1,4,Man #1,Man #1701,Man #1," Cool!
",7,4,1,4,Amy,Amy702,Amy," So what do you think of that guy by the bar?
",46,4,1,4,Man #1,Leela703,Leela," I don't know. Maybe?
",22,4,1,4,Amy,Bender704,Bender," Forget it, he's gay.
",22,4,1,4,Leela,Leela705,Leela," What? How can you tell?
",25,4,1,4,Bender,Bender706,Bender," I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.
",59,4,1,4,Leela,Leela707,Leela," There's no such thing.
",24,4,1,4,Bender,Bender708,Bender," No?  OK, I got a lock on him.  Yep! He's gay!
",47,4,1,4,Leela,Amy709,Amy," Are you sure?
",15,4,1,4,Bender,Bender710,Bender," Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.
",73,4,1,4,Amy,21st-century girl711,21st-century girl," You're from the 20th century? That's incredible! I'm from the 21st century.
",77,4,1,4,Bender,Fry712,Fry," No way! We've got so much in common.
",38,4,1,4,21st-century girl,21st-century girl713,21st-century girl," We sure do. Remember when those cyborgs enslaved humanity?
",60,4,1,4,Fry,Fry714,Fry," Uh, yeah! That rings a bell.
",30,4,1,4,21st-century girl,Amy715,Amy," This is Bolt Rolands. Bolt is a hyper-sled racer with 10 wins on the pro-circuit.
",83,4,1,4,Fry,Bolt716,Bolt," Hello, beautiful!
",19,4,1,4,Amy,Bender717,Bender,"  I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.
",48,4,1,4,Bolt,Bolt718,Bolt," I wish! Those cats can really fly.
",36,4,1,4,Bender,Amy719,Amy," This is M5438, an entity of pure energy.
",42,4,1,4,Bolt,Leela720,Leela," That's great, really, but he's just not what I'm looking for.
",63,4,1,4,Amy,M-8721,M-8," I understand. One day you will evolve beyond your physical body, and on that day I hope you will pick up the phone.
",117,4,1,4,Leela,Amy722,Amy," You're impossible.
",20,4,1,4,M-8,Bender723,Bender," Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre.
",80,4,1,4,Amy,Fry724,Fry," Pst. I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show.
",64,4,1,4,Bender,Bender725,Bender," Can do!
",9,4,1,4,Fry,The Hip Joint janitor726,The Hip Joint janitor," My, my, my! What's a beautiful lady like youâ€”  Oh, my! Eurgh! I'm sorry, I thought you had two eyes.
",102,4,1,4,Bender,Bender727,Bender," So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing time.
",82,4,1,4,The Hip Joint janitor,Leela728,Leela," Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?
",60,4,1,4,Bender,Farnsworth729,Farnsworth," Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later. But right now we have business to attend to.
",101,4,1,4,Leela,Fry730,Fry," A delivery?
",13,4,1,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth731,Farnsworth," No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.
",42,4,1,4,Fry,Computer Voice732,Computer Voice," This is Vergon 6.
",19,4,1,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth733,Farnsworth," This is Vergon 6.
",19,4,1,4,Computer Voice,Amy734,Amy,"  Buh!
",7,4,1,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth735,Farnsworth," It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals.
",91,4,1,4,Amy,Leela736,Leela," Animals?
",10,4,1,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth737,Farnsworth," That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once filled with a super-dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over ten thousand  pounds.
",191,4,1,4,Leela,Leela738,Leela," Wait! What about the animals?
",31,4,1,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth739,Farnsworth," Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow.
",130,4,1,4,Leela,Leela740,Leela," Yes, but what about the animals?
",34,4,1,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth741,Farnsworth," The wha?
",10,4,1,4,Leela,Leela742,Leela," The animals.
",14,4,1,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth743,Farnsworth," I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals.
",146,4,1,4,Leela,Leela744,Leela," So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.
",66,4,1,4,Farnsworth,Bender745,Bender," Why two?  Oh!
",15,4,1,4,Leela,Fry746,Fry," I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.
",60,4,1,4,Bender,Bender747,Bender," That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out.
",95,4,1,4,Fry,Fry748,Fry," Yeah, that'd be a timesaver.
",30,4,1,4,Bender,Leela749,Leela," Do you mind?
",14,4,1,4,Fry,Bender750,Bender," Here you go.  You can use this as an eye-poker.
",49,4,1,4,Leela,Leela751,Leela," Thank you. But I don't care how many eyes a man has ... as long as it's less than five. All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident...
",155,4,1,4,Bender,Leela752,Leela,"  ...maybe a snappy dresser.
",29,4,1,4,Leela,Zapp753,Zapp," These new uniforms are pretty snappy, eh, first officer?
",58,4,1,4,Leela,Kif754,Kif," I suppose, Captain. I'm not as big a fan of velour as you are. Now what do you want to do about that unidentified ship?
",121,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp755,Zapp," Destroy them!  Mmm! That's got a nice feel to it.
",51,4,1,4,Kif,Zapp756,Zapp," Captain's journal: Star date, 3000.3.
",39,4,1,4,Zapp,Kif757,Kif," Who are you talking to, sir?
",30,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp758,Zapp," You! Aren't you getting this?  We have detected a vessel attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6. I'm anticipating an all-out tactical dogfight, followed by a light dinner ... ravioli, ham, sundae bar.
",219,4,1,4,Kif,Leela759,Leela," Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.
",42,4,1,4,Zapp,Fry760,Fry," Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
",26,4,1,4,Leela,Leela761,Leela," Uh-huh!
",9,4,1,4,Fry,Fry762,Fry," Who's the Zapp Brannigan?
",27,4,1,4,Leela,Kif763,Kif," Shall I fire on them now, sir?
",32,4,1,4,Fry,Zapp764,Zapp," Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces.  What?
",94,4,1,4,Kif,Leela765,Leela," They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian System from a horde of rampaging Killbots.
",104,4,1,4,Zapp,Fry766,Fry," Wow!
",6,4,1,4,Leela,Bender767,Bender," A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!
",71,4,1,4,Fry,Leela768,Leela," He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order of Planets.
",75,4,1,4,Bender,Fry769,Fry,"  Leela's got a boyfriend!
",27,4,1,4,Leela,Leela770,Leela," No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue those animals.
",98,4,1,4,Fry,Bender771,Bender," Well, just in case you guys hit it off, you'll wanna take this with you. 
",75,4,1,4,Leela,Kif772,Kif," Sir, they're headed straight for us.
",38,4,1,4,Bender,Zapp773,Zapp," A well-calculated move straight out of Sun Tzu's classic text The Art Of War, or my own masterwork: Zapp Brannigan's Big Book of War.  But the one thing their captain doesn't realise and never will is that--
",209,4,1,4,Kif,Kif774,Kif," Sir, they've docked with us and have come aboard.
",51,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp775,Zapp," Then I have risked all and lost. Kif, old man, I'll be in the escape pod.  If that wicker chair I like survives the slaughter, have it sent to my P.O. box.
",157,4,1,4,Kif,Leela776,Leela," Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship. We've come aboard to plead for your assistance.
",112,4,1,4,Zapp,Kif777,Kif," Well, if there's anything--
",29,4,1,4,Leela,Zapp778,Zapp," I'm in command here. Zapp Brannigan. Has my fame preceded me or was I too quick for you?
",90,4,1,4,Kif,Leela779,Leela," Oh, not at all. I'm just so, uh, really thrilled to meet you!
",63,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp780,Zapp," You're an impressive piece of captain. Beautiful and deadly -- a potent combination.
",86,4,1,4,Leela,Leela781,Leela,"  You don't mean that!
",23,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp782,Zapp," But I do. I doubt I've seen more than three or four captains sexier than you, and only one who was deadlier.
",110,4,1,4,Leela,Fry783,Fry," I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something-something-system.
",119,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp784,Zapp," The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply a matter of outsmarting them.
",69,4,1,4,Fry,Fry785,Fry," Wow! I never would have thought of that!
",42,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp786,Zapp," You see, Killbots have a preset kill limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent wave after wave of my own men at them, until they reached their limit and shutdown. Kif, show them the medal I won. 
",193,4,1,4,Fry,Zapp787,Zapp," More, please.  A little more ... more ... keep going.
",55,4,1,4,Zapp,Leela788,Leela," Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission.
",69,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp789,Zapp," Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave after wave of men at your disposal. Right, men?
",89,4,1,4,Leela,Crewman790,Crewman,"  You suck!
",12,4,1,4,Zapp,Leela791,Leela," We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you could just--
",87,4,1,4,Crewman,Zapp792,Zapp," Vergon 6? This light dinner is over.
",38,4,1,4,Leela,Leela793,Leela," Wait! What's wrong?
",21,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp794,Zapp," The Democratic Order of Planets prohibits interfering with undeveloped worlds. It's a little rule known as ""Brannigan's Law"".
",127,4,1,4,Leela,Leela795,Leela," But people already interfered. That planet was mined completely hollow.
",73,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp796,Zapp," Yes, by a Democratic Order of Planets mining crew.
",52,4,1,4,Leela,Leela797,Leela," This doesn't make any sense.
",30,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp798,Zapp," I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's Law. I merely enforce it.
",69,4,1,4,Leela,Leela799,Leela," Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.
",49,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp800,Zapp," I'm afraid I can't allow that. Guards!
",40,4,1,4,Leela,Fry801,Fry," What just happened?
",21,4,1,4,Zapp,Bender802,Bender," He's throwing us in prison.
",29,4,1,4,Fry,Fry803,Fry," Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?
",34,4,1,4,Bender,Leela804,Leela," Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison.
",92,4,1,4,Fry,Bender805,Bender," You really are too picky.
",27,4,1,4,Leela,Zapp806,Zapp," Kif, follow me up to the observation deck. I've got some musing to do.
",72,4,1,4,Bender,Kif807,Kif," Oh, jeez!
",11,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp808,Zapp," I'm facing a formidable female adversary, Kif. Suggestions?
",61,4,1,4,Kif,Kif809,Kif," I fail to see any problem, sir. You already imprisoned her under directive B-10.8-1.
",86,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp810,Zapp," You mean Brannigan's Law?
",27,4,1,4,Kif,Kif811,Kif," Right, that law.
",18,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp812,Zapp," Which one?
",12,4,1,4,Kif,Kif813,Kif," Brannigan's Law.
",18,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp814,Zapp," Kif, you're my best and most loyal friend but you've earned my contempt once again. As my protÃ©gÃ© you should know that the only way to deal with a female adversary is to seduce her.  This time we are sure she's a woman, right?
",228,4,1,4,Kif,Kif815,Kif," Yes.
",6,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp816,Zapp," Good! Invite her to my quarters. Oh, and have the boy lay out my formal shorts.
",81,4,1,4,Kif,Kif817,Kif," ""The boy"", sir?
",17,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp818,Zapp," You. You lay out my formal shorts.
",36,4,1,4,Kif,Kif819,Kif," The jackass wants to see you in his quarters.
",47,4,1,4,Zapp,Leela820,Leela," Good. This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain.
",70,4,1,4,Kif,Kif821,Kif," And he wants you to wear this.
",32,4,1,4,Leela,Zapp822,Zapp,"  Come and get it!
",19,4,1,4,Kif,Zapp823,Zapp," Welcome to my humble chamber, or as I call it, ""the Lovenasium"". Sham-pag-in?
",79,4,1,4,Zapp,Leela824,Leela," I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.
",48,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp825,Zapp," Well I have studied abroad. Or two!
",37,4,1,4,Leela,Leela826,Leela," Captain--
",11,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp827,Zapp," Uh-huh?
",9,4,1,4,Leela,Leela828,Leela," If we could speak seriously for a moment--
",44,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp829,Zapp," Uh-huh?
",9,4,1,4,Leela,Leela830,Leela," I'd like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals.
",61,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp831,Zapp," Mm-hm.  I like your style. I find it very...  erotic.
",55,4,1,4,Leela,Leela832,Leela," What?
",7,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp833,Zapp,"  Erotic!
",10,4,1,4,Leela,Fry834,Fry," We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe.
",93,4,1,4,Zapp,Bender835,Bender," Hey, yeah!
",12,4,1,4,Fry,Fry836,Fry," No good! It's full of steam!
",30,4,1,4,Bender,Zapp837,Zapp," You look like a woman who enjoys the finer things. Come over here and feel my velour bedspread.
",97,4,1,4,Fry,Leela838,Leela," I'm not really in the mood.
",29,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp839,Zapp," Leela, it's real velour. Just let yourself go.
",48,4,1,4,Leela,Leela840,Leela," Can I please just go back to prison?
",38,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp841,Zapp," You'd rather sit in prison than spend one evening with the Zapper?
",68,4,1,4,Leela,Leela842,Leela," Much rather!  What are you doing?
",35,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp843,Zapp,"  Oh, God, I'm pathetic. Sorry. Just go. You want the rest of the sham-pag-in?
",79,4,1,4,Leela,Leela844,Leela," No. And it's pronounced ""sham-pane"".
",38,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp845,Zapp,"  Oh, God, no!
",15,4,1,4,Leela,Leela846,Leela," It's not a big deal.
",22,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp847,Zapp,"  I get so lonely. I just thought you, a fellow captain, would understand.
",75,4,1,4,Leela,Leela848,Leela," Oh, forget it.
",16,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp849,Zapp,"  Yeah, it's great ordering people around and stuff but through it all you're completely alone.
",96,4,1,4,Leela,Leela850,Leela," It comes with the job.
",24,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp851,Zapp,"  I'm just so lonely!
",22,4,1,4,Leela,Leela852,Leela," Oh, come on. Cheer up. It's not that bad.
",43,4,1,4,Zapp,Fry853,Fry," You wanna try escaping again?
",31,4,1,4,Leela,Bender854,Bender," Nah, I'm comfy.
",17,4,1,4,Fry,Fry855,Fry," Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp Brannigan.
",96,4,1,4,Bender,Zapp856,Zapp," Good morning, lover.
",22,4,1,4,Fry,Leela857,Leela," Uh, listen, Zapp.
",19,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp858,Zapp," Now you're officially my woman. Kudos! I can't say I don't envy you.
",70,4,1,4,Leela,Leela859,Leela," Zapp, last night was a mistake.
",33,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp860,Zapp," A sexy mistake.
",17,4,1,4,Leela,Leela861,Leela," No, just a regular mistake. For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity.
",89,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp862,Zapp," A split second is all it takes. That's why sooner or later you'll come crawling back to the Zapper.
",101,4,1,4,Leela,Leela863,Leela," The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away ... from!
",62,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp864,Zapp," Leela, you're obviously confused and aroused.
",47,4,1,4,Leela,Leela865,Leela," Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not.
",84,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp866,Zapp," Go ahead. I won't stop you.
",29,4,1,4,Leela,Leela867,Leela," Threaten all you-- Wait. What?
",32,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp868,Zapp," We both know you won't make it halfway to Vergon 6 before the craving sets in. Then you'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet, sweet candy ... bam!
",160,4,1,4,Leela,Leela869,Leela," Eurgh!
",8,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp870,Zapp,"  Kif!
",7,4,1,4,Leela,Kif871,Kif," Yes--  Yes, Captain?
",22,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp872,Zapp," I have made it with a woman. Inform the men.
",46,4,1,4,Kif,Kif873,Kif," The fatso says you're free to go.
",35,4,1,4,Zapp,Fry874,Fry," Really? Why?
",14,4,1,4,Kif,Kif875,Kif,"  ""Why"" indeed.
",16,4,1,4,Fry,Fry876,Fry," What does that mean?
",22,4,1,4,Kif,Leela877,Leela,"  Nothing.
",11,4,1,4,Fry,Bender878,Bender," So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?
",57,4,1,4,Leela,Leela879,Leela,"  We just talked, OK?!
",23,4,1,4,Bender,Leela880,Leela," Alright, we don't have much time to collect these animals. The planet is supposed to collapse in approximately two hours ago.
",127,4,1,4,Leela,Leela881,Leela," Hello, there.  Hmm. He doesn't seem to be on the checklist.
",61,4,1,4,Leela,Bender882,Bender," So, you're saying we can cook him?
",36,4,1,4,Leela,Fry883,Fry," Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron.
",49,4,1,4,Bender,Leela884,Leela," No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him.  Aww! I'll call him Nibbler.
",99,4,1,4,Fry,Bender885,Bender," Aww!  I'll fire up the grill!
",31,4,1,4,Leela,Leela886,Leela," I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals.
",57,4,1,4,Bender,Zapp887,Zapp," Y'know, Kif, once my woman returns I won't have much time to hang out with the boys anymore.
",94,4,1,4,Leela,Kif888,Kif," That's a shame, sir.
",22,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp889,Zapp," So let's make the most of our time together, shall we?  Never mind. Just give me a back rub.
",94,4,1,4,Kif,Bender890,Bender," I found a pair of hermaphlamingos.
",36,4,1,4,Zapp,Leela891,Leela," Good. That's the last species.
",32,4,1,4,Bender,Bender892,Bender," Hey. What the--?
",18,4,1,4,Leela,Fry893,Fry," Where'd they all go?
",22,4,1,4,Bender,Leela894,Leela," Nibbler!
",10,4,1,4,Fry,Fry895,Fry," I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!
",113,4,1,4,Leela,Bender896,Bender," He's pending for a bending.
",29,4,1,4,Fry,Leela897,Leela," Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is it, snoogums?
",96,4,1,4,Bender,Fry898,Fry," The planet's kerploding!
",26,4,1,4,Leela,Leela899,Leela," Prepare for lift-off.  We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left.
",95,4,1,4,Fry,Bender900,Bender," Yeah, I'll do it when we get back.
",36,4,1,4,Leela,Fry901,Fry," Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.
",44,4,1,4,Bender,Leela902,Leela," No way! Forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!
",57,4,1,4,Fry,Fry903,Fry," What? What are you talking about?
",35,4,1,4,Leela,Leela904,Leela,"  Nothing. We just talked.
",27,4,1,4,Fry,Bender905,Bender," So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him.  Oh, my God!
",72,4,1,4,Leela,Fry906,Fry," How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!
",99,4,1,4,Bender,Leela907,Leela," That's enough! Don't you think I feel bad enough already?
",59,4,1,4,Fry,Fry908,Fry," No!
",5,4,1,4,Leela,Leela909,Leela," Alright, alright. I'll call him.  I mean, if living is that important to you.
",79,4,1,4,Fry,Zapp910,Zapp," And that's why you'll never make captain, Kif.  Hmm.
",54,4,1,4,Leela,Leela911,Leela,"  Hello, Zapp?
",15,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp912,Zapp," Well, well, well!
",19,4,1,4,Leela,Leela913,Leela," Zapp, we're out of fuel...
",28,4,1,4,Zapp,Leela914,Leela,"  ...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need your help.
",58,4,1,4,Leela,Zapp915,Zapp," So, crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly. Delicious.
",69,4,1,4,Leela,Leela916,Leela,"  Bird's don't crawl.
",22,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp917,Zapp," They've been known to.
",24,4,1,4,Leela,Leela918,Leela," Look, are you going to rescue us or not?
",42,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp919,Zapp,"  Can't you ask a little more ... sexfully?
",44,4,1,4,Leela,Leela920,Leela,"  Please?
",10,4,1,4,Zapp,Leela921,Leela,"  Big Z?
",9,4,1,4,Leela,Zapp922,Zapp," Certainly. But first you'll have to get rid of that thing.  That's the law, Leela. And Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's love: Hard and fast!
",145,4,1,4,Leela,Zapp923,Zapp,"  Now put that greasy rat outside and we'll tow you to safety.
",63,4,1,4,Zapp,Leela924,Leela," I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a big, pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child. But now I realise that outside that child is a big, pompous buffoon!
",232,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp925,Zapp,"  And which one rocked your world?
",35,4,1,4,Leela,Fry926,Fry," Wow! Way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?
",68,4,1,4,Zapp,Leela927,Leela," Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death.
",45,4,1,4,Fry,Bender928,Bender," Can do!
",9,4,1,4,Leela,Bender929,Bender," What the hell was that?
",25,4,1,4,Bender,Fry930,Fry," Pew!
",6,4,1,4,Bender,Leela931,Leela," I don't believe it! It's dark matter.
",39,4,1,4,Fry,Bender932,Bender," So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?
",61,4,1,4,Leela,Leela933,Leela," His species must've filled the entire planet with it. Did you do that, you cute little--  Come on. That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here. Bender, pick it up and put it in the engine.
",204,4,1,4,Bender,Leela934,Leela," We made it!  And some of the animals survived.
",48,4,1,4,Leela,Bender935,Bender," So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful mission!
",97,4,1,4,Leela,Fry936,Fry," We're heroes!
",15,4,1,4,Bender,Leela937,Leela,"  Dear Captain's Diary: I may not have found love on this mission but I did find a cute little companion who excretes starship fuel. And that's just as good.
",158,4,1,4,Fry,Zapp938,Zapp,"  Captain's journal: Star date ... uh.
",39,4,1,4,Leela,Kif939,Kif,"  April 13th.
",14,4,1,4,Zapp,Zapp940,Zapp,"  April 13th ... point two.
",28,4,1,4,Kif,Zapp941,Zapp," We have failed to uphold Brannigan's Law. However, I did make it with a hot alien babe. And in the end is that not what man has dreamt of since first he looked up at the stars? Kif, I'm asking you a question!
",210,4,1,4,Zapp,Leela942,Leela," What do you think of the view Fry?
",36,5,1,5,Zapp,Fry943,Fry," It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant.
",108,5,1,5,Leela,Bender944,Bender," Hey nice seats! We're close enough so when you knock a player down with a beer bottle, he stays down!
",103,5,1,5,Fry,Fry945,Fry," I don't get it. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?
",61,5,1,5,Bender,Farnsworth946,Farnsworth," Baseball?? God forbid!
",24,5,1,5,Fry,Leela947,Leela," Face it Fry. Baseball was as boring as mum and apple pie. That's why they jazzed it up.
",89,5,1,5,Farnsworth,Fry948,Fry," Boring? Baseball wasn't - hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?
",62,5,1,5,Leela,Fry949,Fry," Home run!! Woooo! Right?
",26,5,1,5,Fry,Umpire950,Umpire," Out!
",6,5,1,5,Fry,Fry951,Fry," What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?
",60,5,1,5,Umpire,Leela952,Leela," It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.
",74,5,1,5,Fry,Bender953,Bender," I got me a souvenir!  Aww here you go kid!
",44,5,1,5,Leela,Zoidberg954,Zoidberg," I'd like a jumbo squidlog please.
",35,5,1,5,Bender,Man #1955,Man #1," We don't sell those.
",22,5,1,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg956,Zoidberg," Alright, alright. Let me have one of your young on a roll.
",60,5,1,5,Man #1,Man #1957,Man #1," We're out of rolls.
",21,5,1,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg958,Zoidberg," Fine! Just give me something crawling with parasites.
",55,5,1,5,Man #1,Fry959,Fry," Mmmm, at least hot dogs haven't changed.
",42,5,1,5,Zoidberg,Bender960,Bender," Hey buddies who wants popcorn?
",32,5,1,5,Fry,All961,All," I'll have some, me, yeah!
",27,5,1,5,Bender,Bender962,Bender," Anyone want butter on that?
",29,5,1,5,All,Fry963,Fry," Hey I'm starting to get the hang of this game! The blerns are loaded, the count's three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in effect, right?
",164,5,1,5,Bender,Leela964,Leela," Except for the word ""blern"" that was complete gibberish. [The blernsball falls into a hole and indescribable mayhem ensues! Fry scratches his head in confusion. Leela writes on her score card. All right! Yes!!
",211,5,1,5,Fry,Fry965,Fry," What just happened?
",21,5,1,5,Leela,Leela966,Leela," Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!
",38,5,1,5,Fry,Farnsworth967,Farnsworth," He's good all right. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days when steroid injections were mandatory.
",124,5,1,5,Leela,Bender968,Bender," Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!
",147,5,1,5,Farnsworth,Leela969,Leela," Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean come on! Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.
",126,5,1,5,Bender,Bender970,Bender," Oh and I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer.
",65,5,1,5,Leela,Leela971,Leela," Yep.
",6,5,1,5,Bender,Bender972,Bender," You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even let us on the field.
",92,5,1,5,Leela,Fry973,Fry," What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.
",69,5,1,5,Bender,Bender974,Bender," Yeah doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?
",115,5,1,5,Fry,Fry975,Fry," Eleven?
",9,5,1,5,Bender,Bender976,Bender," Zero!  And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth! Is it a human child? I wish!
",92,5,1,5,Fry,Farnsworth977,Farnsworth," Oh dear Lord!
",15,5,1,5,Bender,Fry978,Fry," What's wrong?
",15,5,1,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth979,Farnsworth," It's...my...new...pager.
",26,5,1,5,Fry,Hermes980,Hermes," Â : This is Hermes. A package just came in. Everyone is to return to the office immediately.  Get away you filthy bird! Shoo! Professor turn me off quick!
",155,5,1,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth981,Farnsworth," I'm sorry what?
",17,5,1,5,Hermes,Hermes982,Hermes," Â : Argh!  See you at the office!
",34,5,1,5,Farnsworth,Bender983,Bender," Admit it. You all think robots are machines built by humans to make their lives easier.
",89,5,1,5,Hermes,Fry984,Fry," Well, aren't they?
",20,5,1,5,Bender,Bender985,Bender," I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!
",55,5,1,5,Fry,Farnsworth986,Farnsworth," Great news everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9. A world where humans are killed on sight!
",108,5,1,5,Bender,Fry987,Fry," Why is that great news?
",25,5,1,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth988,Farnsworth," I'm glad you asked that question Fry. You see Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists.
",134,5,1,5,Fry,Bender989,Bender," Oh so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a radical?
",74,5,1,5,Farnsworth,Leela990,Leela," Hey hold on. I understand these robots hate humans but how do they feel about humanoid aliens?
",96,5,1,5,Bender,Farnsworth991,Farnsworth," They're not fans.
",19,5,1,5,Leela,Hermes992,Hermes," That's why Bender will have to make the actual delivery.
",58,5,1,5,Farnsworth,Bender993,Bender," Oh I get it, make the robot do all the work!
",46,5,1,5,Hermes,Leela994,Leela," This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.
",66,5,1,5,Bender,Bender995,Bender," Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
",46,5,1,5,Leela,Fry996,Fry," Really? Which one?
",20,5,1,5,Bender,Bender997,Bender," Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
",62,5,1,5,Fry,Leela998,Leela," Oh come on Bender. Last month it was Robomadan and before that Robonzaa.
",74,5,1,5,Bender,Fry999,Fry," Man that one was a blast!
",27,5,1,5,Leela,Bender1000,Bender," It wasn't just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
",130,5,1,5,Fry,Hermes1001,Hermes," Now look here Bender. I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires but you used up all your days off when you had that bout of Roberculosis.
",153,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1002,Bender," All right, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last one of you for the rest of your lives.
",114,5,1,5,Hermes,Farnsworth1003,Farnsworth," Well then it's settled. So long everyone!
",43,5,1,5,Bender,Fry1004,Fry," So let me get this straight: This planet is completely uninhabited?
",69,5,1,5,Farnsworth,Bender1005,Bender," No. It's inhabited by robots!
",31,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1006,Fry," Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.
",55,5,1,5,Bender,Leela1007,Leela," OK Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work.
",50,5,1,5,Fry,Bender1008,Bender," Yes Miss Leela, tote that space barge, lift that space bale.
",62,5,1,5,Leela,Leela1009,Leela," Now we can't land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me, so we'll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember: You don't know humans, you don't work for humans, and above all, you don't like humans!
",239,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1010,Bender," I'll try to keep that in mind!
",32,5,1,5,Leela,Leela1011,Leela," Hmm, he seems pretty angry.
",29,5,1,5,Bender,Fry1012,Fry," Yeah but I guess I'd be angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet.
",78,5,1,5,Leela,Leela1013,Leela," Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.
",46,5,1,5,Fry,Leela1014,Leela," There. That ought to show that stupid robot we care about him.
",64,5,1,5,Leela,Fry1015,Fry," Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.
",44,5,1,5,Leela,Bender1016,Bender," Â : I'm in trouble. they found out I work with humans and - oh no, oh no!
",74,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1017,Fry," Oh my God! We have to go down and rescue him.
",47,5,1,5,Bender,Leela1018,Leela," No we can't! They'll kill us on sight.
",40,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1019,Fry," Well what are we going to do?
",31,5,1,5,Leela,Leela1020,Leela," I don't know, I don't know. It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think about it.
",110,5,1,5,Fry,Leela1021,Leela," OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots.
",83,5,1,5,Leela,Fry1022,Fry," Â : I am fully operational Captain.
",36,5,1,5,Leela,Leela1023,Leela," We have to walk like robots, talk like robots and if necessary solve complex differential equations like robots.
",114,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1024,Fry," I can sort of dance like a robot. Will that help?
",51,5,1,5,Leela,Leela1025,Leela," Fry first of all this is serious. And second of all...
",56,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1026,Fry," Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store bought costumes.
",65,5,1,5,Leela,Leela1027,Leela," Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant.

",16,5,1,5,Robot #1 guard #2,Fry1031,Fry," Uh yup! Just two robots out roboting it up!  Eh?
",50,5,1,5,Leela,Robot #1 guard #11032,Robot #1 guard #1," Administer the test.
",22,5,1,5,Fry,Robot #1 guard #21033,Robot #1 guard #2," Which of the following would you most prefer? A: A puppy? B: A pretty flower from your sweetie or C: A large properly formatted data file?
",140,5,1,5,Robot #1 guard #1,Robot #1 guard #11034,Robot #1 guard #1," Choose!
",9,5,1,5,Robot #1 guard #2,Fry1035,Fry," Is the puppy mechanical in any way?
",37,5,1,5,Robot #1 guard #1,Robot #1 guard #21036,Robot #1 guard #2," No. It is the bad kind of puppy.
",34,5,1,5,Fry,Leela1037,Leela," Then we'll go with that data file.
",36,5,1,5,Robot #1 guard #2,Robot #1 guard #21038,Robot #1 guard #2," Correct.
",10,5,1,5,Leela,Robot #1 guard #11039,Robot #1 guard #1," The flower would also have been acceptable.

",15,5,1,5,Robot #1 guard #1,Leela1041,Leela," Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way.  So far, so good.
",74,5,1,5,Robot #1 guard #2,Robot #1 builder1042,Robot #1 builder," Little to the right, there you go.
",36,5,1,5,Leela,Leela1043,Leela," Have you seen this robot?
",27,5,1,5,Robot #1 builder,Robot #1 builder1044,Robot #1 builder," Sorry, can't help you.  Hey, watch it! Don't drop that there!  Aw!
",68,5,1,5,Leela,Leela1045,Leela," Come on Fry, walk like a robot.
",33,5,1,5,Robot #1 builder,Fry1046,Fry," I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.
",40,5,1,5,Leela,Leela1047,Leela," Robot's don't have bathrooms.
",31,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1048,Fry," Oh right. I wonder where they all smoke in high school.
",57,5,1,5,Leela,Leela1049,Leela," Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.
",62,5,1,5,Fry,Leela1050,Leela," Hurry up Fry.
",15,5,1,5,Leela,Resin-offering robot1051,Resin-offering robot," Sir? Are you aware that you're leaking coolant at an alarming rate?
",69,5,1,5,Leela,Fry1052,Fry," Uh...
",7,5,1,5,Resin-offering robot,Resin-offering robot1053,Resin-offering robot," Well let me just patch you up with some hot resin.
",52,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1054,Fry," I think the leak's stopping itself.  Wait.  Wait. Yeah, there we go.  Wait. Yeah!
",83,5,1,5,Resin-offering robot,Resin-offering robot1055,Resin-offering robot," What sort of robot turns down a free blast of searing hot resin?
",66,5,1,5,Fry,Leela1056,Leela," I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive tasks.
",83,5,1,5,Resin-offering robot,Resin-offering robot1057,Resin-offering robot," Sounds like a romantic evening. I won't keep you.
",51,5,1,5,Leela,Patrol Officer #11058,Patrol Officer #1," Get the humanoids.
",20,5,1,5,Resin-offering robot,Patrol Officer #21059,Patrol Officer #2," Get the intruder.
",19,5,1,5,Patrol Officer #1,Announcer #11060,Announcer #1," Â : Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

",28,5,1,5,Announcer #1,Announcer #11062,Announcer #1," Â : We interrupt this sound file to bring you a terrifying announcement. A non-metallic being has been sighted in the vicinity of Make Out Point.
",146,5,1,5,Leela,Rusty1063,Rusty," Â : Say Wendy. Your chassis is a little scuffed. Mind if I polish it for you?
",78,5,1,5,Announcer #1,Wendy1064,Wendy," Â : Did you hear that Rusty? It sounded like a human.
",54,5,1,5,Rusty,Rusty1065,Rusty," Â : Relax Wendy. Humans will never come to our defenceless little town. It's perfectly safe to let our guard down - even for a second.
",135,5,1,5,Wendy,Robot #1 Human1066,Robot #1 Human,"  Graaah!  I will eat and digest you all with my system of mighty organs! Behold!
",82,5,1,5,Rusty,Audience1067,Audience," Ooooo!
",8,5,1,5,Robot #1 Human,Fry1068,Fry," Wow the 3-D's great!
",22,5,1,5,Audience,Leela1069,Leela," Mine's not working!
",21,5,1,5,Fry,Robot #1 General1070,Robot #1 General," Â : Funny, isn't it? The human was impervious to our most powerful magnetic fields, yet in the end he succumbed to a harmless sharpened stick!
",143,5,1,5,Leela,Wendy1071,Wendy," Â : I'm just glad the nightmare is over.
",41,5,1,5,Robot #1 General,Robot #1 General1072,Robot #1 General," Â : It'll never be over Wendy. Even now humans are lurking in our playgrounds, our breezeways, perhaps even...our movie theatres!
",130,5,1,5,Wendy,Fry1073,Fry," God help us!
",14,5,1,5,Robot #1 General,Leela1074,Leela," OK. Keep an eyeout for Bender.
",32,5,1,5,Fry,Robot #1 #11075,Robot #1 #1," So what did you think of the movie?
",37,5,1,5,Leela,Fry1076,Fry," Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing.
",50,5,1,5,Robot #1 #1,Robot #1 #21077,Robot #1 #2," Yeah, it was a real chick flick.
",34,5,1,5,Fry,Leela1078,Leela," What's that?
",14,5,1,5,Robot #1 #2,Robot #1 #11079,Robot #1 #1," What do you mean ""What's that?""? Its 5 o'clock: Time for the daily human hunt.
",80,5,1,5,Leela,Leela1080,Leela," Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.
",67,5,1,5,Robot #1 #1,Crummy Robot #11081,Crummy Robot #1," Awww that was uncalled for!
",29,5,1,5,Leela,Fry1082,Fry," I'm over here!
",16,5,1,5,Crummy Robot #1,Robot #1 #41083,Robot #1 #4," I heard a human was draining coolant behind garbage can 738.
",62,5,1,5,Fry,Robot #1 #51084,Robot #1 #5," I heard they unscrew our lugnuts at night and eat them at their human brunches.
",81,5,1,5,Robot #1 #4,Robot #1 Mayor1085,Robot #1 Mayor," Welcome to a very special human hunt. We have with us today a guest who's irrational hatred of humans makes me look like a human sympathiser!  A newly arrived refugee from Earth, lets hear it for - Bender!
",207,5,1,5,Robot #1 #5,Fry1086,Fry," It's him. He's OK!
",20,5,1,5,Robot #1 Mayor,Bender1087,Bender," Death to humans!
",18,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1088,Fry," Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!
",35,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1089,Bender," Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihalation of the human species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after living on Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!
",216,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1090,Fry," My God! He's become evil.  I mean eviler!
",43,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1091,Bender," Thank you, thank you. And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want to purchase my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender action figurine.
",171,5,1,5,Fry,Bender Figurine1092,Bender Figurine," Bite my shiny metal ass!
",26,5,1,5,Bender,Robot #1 Mayor1093,Robot #1 Mayor," Let the hunt begin!
",21,5,1,5,Bender Figurine,Bender1094,Bender," Now. Your basic human is between three and twenty five feet tall and is made of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt.
",121,5,1,5,Robot #1 Mayor,Robot #1 #11095,Robot #1 #1," Is it true they bite your neck, suck your transmission fluid and then you become a human?
",91,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1096,Bender," Sure, why not?
",16,5,1,5,Robot #1 #1,Robot #1 #11097,Robot #1 #1," Anything in the trap?
",23,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1098,Bender," Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low calorie bait.
",59,5,1,5,Robot #1 #1,Robot #1 Mayor1099,Robot #1 Mayor," Well that makes 146,000 unsuccessful hunts in a row. But I've got a good feeling about tomorrow.
",98,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1100,Bender," Wait, what's that?
",20,5,1,5,Robot #1 Mayor,Robot #1 Mayor1101,Robot #1 Mayor," Oh thats the old abandoned adult book store. Nothing in there except a few mouldy old shreads of robot pornography.
",117,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1102,Bender," Hmmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out.
",74,5,1,5,Robot #1 Mayor,Bender1103,Bender," Oh yeah! You're a bad girl aren't you?
",40,5,1,5,Bender,Fry1104,Fry," Psst! Bender!
",15,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1105,Bender," Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?
",50,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1106,Fry," We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.
",89,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1107,Bender," I was. But they let me go when I told them that I'd killed a million billion humans.
",86,5,1,5,Fry,Leela1108,Leela," Good for you. Now lets all get back to the ship.
",50,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1109,Bender," What for?
",11,5,1,5,Leela,Fry1110,Fry," We're rescuing you.
",21,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1111,Bender," I don't wanna be rescued.
",27,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1112,Fry," Say what?
",11,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1113,Bender," I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to sleaze that those things bring.
",89,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1114,Fry," But Bender, we're your friends.
",33,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1115,Bender," Friends? That activates my hilairity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster, the phonograph or the electric chair.
",171,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1116,Fry," That's not true.
",18,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1117,Bender," Well that's how it feels to me.
",33,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1118,Fry," Bye Bender. I'll miss you.
",28,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1119,Bender," Go on, get out of here before you get caught.
",47,5,1,5,Fry,Robot #1 Mayor1120,Robot #1 Mayor," Bender, good news. Your album just went gold! What the?
",57,5,1,5,Bender,Robot #1 #11121,Robot #1 #1," Its the humans!
",17,5,1,5,Robot #1 Mayor,Robot #1 Mayor1122,Robot #1 Mayor," Bender! Do something!
",23,5,1,5,Robot #1 #1,Bender1123,Bender," Uh...got you...you muderous...flesh piles!
",44,5,1,5,Robot #1 Mayor,Robot #1 Mayor1124,Robot #1 Mayor," Your Honour, I intend to demonstrate beyond 0.5% of a doubt that these humans before us are guilty of the crime of being humans. Come to think of it, I rest my case!
",167,5,1,5,Bender,Judge #11125,Judge #1," Thank you, Prosecutor. I will now consider the evidence.
",58,5,1,5,Robot #1 Mayor,Fry1126,Fry," Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone gonna defend us?
",51,5,1,5,Judge #1,Leela1127,Leela," Yeah! I mean, he might not have a case, but I'm genuinely not human.
",70,5,1,5,Fry,Robot #1 Mayor1128,Robot #1 Mayor," Quiet, human!
",15,5,1,5,Leela,Robot #1 clerk1129,Robot #1 clerk," Uh oh! He froze up again!
",27,5,1,5,Robot #1 Mayor,Robot #1 Mayor1130,Robot #1 Mayor," Try control alt delete.
",25,5,1,5,Robot #1 clerk,Robot #1 #11131,Robot #1 #1," Jiggle the cord.
",18,5,1,5,Robot #1 Mayor,Robot #1 #21132,Robot #1 #2," Turn him off and on.
",22,5,1,5,Robot #1 #1,Robot #1 #31133,Robot #1 #3," Clean the gunk out of the mouse.
",34,5,1,5,Robot #1 #2,Fry1134,Fry," Call technical support.
",25,5,1,5,Robot #1 #3,Robot #1 clerk1135,Robot #1 clerk," OK, OK. He's back online.
",27,5,1,5,Fry,Judge #11136,Judge #1," I find the defendants - guilty!
",33,5,1,5,Robot #1 clerk,Fry1137,Fry," No!
",5,5,1,5,Judge #1,Leela1138,Leela," Look! One eye! Count them: One! Not human!
",44,5,1,5,Fry,Judge #11139,Judge #1," The humans are hereby sentenced to live as robots live on Earth. They will perform tedious calculations and spot-weld automobiles, until they become obsolete and are given away to an inner-city middle school.
",210,5,1,5,Leela,Robot #1 Mayor1140,Robot #1 Mayor," Great work Bender! You've taught us to hate humans all over again!
",68,5,1,5,Judge #1,Bender1141,Bender," Â : Heh heh heh! Oooh!
",23,5,1,5,Robot #1 Mayor,Leela1142,Leela," Are you alright?
",18,5,1,5,Bender,Fry1143,Fry," Oh yeah.
",10,5,1,5,Leela,Leela1144,Leela," Who are you?
",14,5,1,5,Fry,Blue Elder1145,Blue Elder," We are the robot elders.
",26,5,1,5,Leela,Fry1146,Fry," You don't look very old.
",26,5,1,5,Blue Elder,Blue Elder1147,Blue Elder," Thanks. We try to take care of ourselves.
",43,5,1,5,Fry,Leela1148,Leela," What's going on here?
",23,5,1,5,Blue Elder,Orange Elder1149,Orange Elder," Silence! Bring in Bender.
",27,5,1,5,Leela,Bender1150,Bender," Alright lets make this quick, I'm due at the opening of a mini-mall. Hey what is this?
",88,5,1,5,Orange Elder,Blue Elder1151,Blue Elder," Silence! It is time to put the humans to death!
",49,5,1,5,Bender,Fry1152,Fry," But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!
",50,5,1,5,Blue Elder,Orange Elder1153,Orange Elder," Silence! That was just a show for the public. We are the true rulers of this planet, hand carved from meteorites by the Robot Founders, over four centuries ago.
",162,5,1,5,Fry,Blue Elder1154,Blue Elder," Silence! Come forward Bender. You will have the honour of executing the prisoners.
",84,5,1,5,Orange Elder,Green Elder1155,Green Elder," Silence! I concur!
",20,5,1,5,Blue Elder,Orange Elder1156,Orange Elder," Here. Use the ceremonial killamajig.
",38,5,1,5,Green Elder,Bender1157,Bender," Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave them a savage beating?
",93,5,1,5,Orange Elder,Blue Elder1158,Blue Elder," No! The Elders have spoken. Show us the killing skills than have made you a media darling.
",92,5,1,5,Bender,Green Elder1159,Green Elder," Do it now! Kill them before they bring down our whole society!
",64,5,1,5,Blue Elder,Elders1160,Elders," Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
",92,5,1,5,Green Elder,Bender1161,Bender," Aww!  I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. they're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards.
",165,5,1,5,Elders,Fry1162,Fry," Damn right!
",13,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1163,Bender," The fact is, humans are completely harmless.
",46,5,1,5,Fry,Blue Elder1164,Blue Elder," We're well aware of that.
",27,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1165,Bender," You are?
",10,5,1,5,Blue Elder,Blue Elder1166,Blue Elder," Of course. But they're useful to us as a scapegoat to distract the public from their real problem.
",100,5,1,5,Bender,Green Elder1167,Green Elder," Like our crippling lugnut shortage.
",37,5,1,5,Blue Elder,Orange Elder1168,Orange Elder," And a corrupt government of incompetent Robot Elders.
",55,5,1,5,Green Elder,Lime Elder1169,Lime Elder," Duh, that's for sure.
",23,5,1,5,Orange Elder,Blue Elder1170,Blue Elder," Quiet Jimmy.
",14,5,1,5,Lime Elder,Bender1171,Bender," Well I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out.
",78,5,1,5,Blue Elder,Green Elder1172,Green Elder," Silence! You all know too much.
",33,5,1,5,Bender,Blue Elder1173,Blue Elder," Elders: Execute function, control, shift, kill!
",49,5,1,5,Green Elder,Fry1174,Fry," Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe fire on you!
",56,5,1,5,Blue Elder,Leela1175,Leela," He'll do it. He's crazy!
",26,5,1,5,Fry,Orange Elder1176,Orange Elder," Can they really breathe fire or did we make that up?
",54,5,1,5,Leela,Blue Elder1177,Blue Elder," Gee, I can't remember anymore! It might just be from that stupid movie.
",73,5,1,5,Orange Elder,Green Elder1178,Green Elder," Was that the original or the re-make?
",39,5,1,5,Blue Elder,Blue Elder1179,Blue Elder," I don't - hey! They're getting away.
",38,5,1,5,Green Elder,Fry1180,Fry," So long suckers!  Uh, hello suckers!
",38,5,1,5,Blue Elder,Bender1181,Bender," Hey hold on a second I forgot to deliver the package.
",55,5,1,5,Fry,Robot #1 #11182,Robot #1 #1," Lugnuts! Precious lugnuts!
",28,5,1,5,Bender,Robot #1 #21183,Robot #1 #2," Hooray for the humans!
",24,5,1,5,Robot #1 #1,Bender1184,Bender," Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best Robanukah ever!
",85,5,1,5,Robot #1 #2,Fry1185,Fry," We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.
",70,5,1,5,Bender,Bender1186,Bender," Aww, thanks! You do know I made Robanukah up to get out of work right?
",72,5,1,5,Fry,Leela1187,Leela," Of course.
",12,5,1,5,Bender,Fry1188,Fry," But that doesn't make it any less meaningful!
",47,5,1,5,Leela,Bender1189,Bender," In that case - let the dancing begin!  Hey you guys are good. How the hell do you do that??
",93,5,1,5,Fry,Fry1190,Fry," I can't take it anymore! They've been at it for hours!   Give it a rest, you two!
",83,6,1,6,Bender,Robot #11191,Robot #1,"  Sorry!
",9,6,1,6,Fry,Teacher1192,Teacher," Good morning, class. I trust you've all prepared for today's final exam.
",74,6,1,6,Robot #1,Fry1193,Fry," Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. Uh, what subject is this?
",67,6,1,6,Teacher,Teacher1194,Teacher," Ancient Egyptian algebra.
",27,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1195,Fry," What a nightmare!
",19,6,1,6,Teacher,Teacher1196,Teacher," Mister Fry, are those your underpants?  Young man, I think it's time you learned a lesson about Lightspeed brand briefs.
",122,6,1,6,Fry,Announcer #11197,Announcer #1,"  Lightspeed fits today's active lifestyle. Whether you're on the job ...  ... or having fun.  Lightspeed briefs, style and comfort for the discriminating crotch.
",163,6,1,6,Teacher,Fry1198,Fry," What a weird dream! I'll never get back to sleep.
",51,6,1,6,Announcer #1,Fry1199,Fry," So you're telling me they broadcast commercials into people's dreams?
",71,6,1,6,Fry,Leela1200,Leela," Of course.
",12,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1201,Fry," But, how is that possible?
",28,6,1,6,Leela,Farnsworth1202,Farnsworth," It's very simple. The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid gets into this egg.  Although, in reality, it's not liquid, but gamma radiation.
",150,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1203,Fry," That's awful. It's like brainwashing.
",39,6,1,6,Farnsworth,Leela1204,Leela," Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?
",42,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1205,Fry," Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines and movies and at ball games, on buses and milk cartons and T-shirts and bananas and written on the sky. But not in dreams. No, sir-ee!
",211,6,1,6,Leela,Bender1206,Bender," Quit squawking, flesh wad. Nobody's forcing you to buy anything.
",66,6,1,6,Fry,Amy1207,Amy," Yeah. I mean we all have commercials in our dreams but you don't see us running off to buy brand-name merchandise at low, low prices.
",135,6,1,6,Bender,Perfume saleswoman1208,Perfume saleswoman," Hi! Care to sample the latest fragrance from Calvin Clone?
",60,6,1,6,Amy,Amy1209,Amy," No thanks.
",12,6,1,6,Perfume saleswoman,Perfume saleswoman1210,Perfume saleswoman," And you, sir?
",15,6,1,6,Amy,Bender1211,Bender," No thanks. I--
",16,6,1,6,Perfume saleswoman,Cosmetologist1212,Cosmetologist," What a lovely face. We just need to draw attention away from the eye area.
",76,6,1,6,Bender,Fry1213,Fry," Cool.  Can I try these on before I buy them?
",46,6,1,6,Cosmetologist,Salesman #11214,Salesman #1," I'm afraid I can't let you open the package. But you can try on the demo pair.
",80,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1215,Fry," Ooh! Ho, ho, ho!
",18,6,1,6,Salesman #1,Amy1216,Amy," Hey, Bender! Great new sweater.
",33,6,1,6,Fry,Bender1217,Bender," New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!
",64,6,1,6,Amy,Salesman #11218,Salesman #1," $30, please.
",14,6,1,6,Bender,Fry1219,Fry," $30? I can't afford that. Unless...  Do you take Visa?
",56,6,1,6,Salesman #1,Salesman #11220,Salesman #1," Visa hasn't existed for 500 years.
",36,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1221,Fry," American Express?

",31,6,1,6,Fry,Amy1225,Amy," Hey! You're springing for Lightspeed? Pretty ritzy!
",53,6,1,6,Salesman #1,Fry1226,Fry," No, I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. What kind of world is this where they advertise things not everybody can afford?
",125,6,1,6,Amy,Amy1227,Amy," Quiet. There's an ad coming on.
",33,6,1,6,Fry,Mom1228,Mom,"  Hello, shoppers. It's me, Mom!
",33,6,1,6,Amy,Fry1229,Fry," Hey who's the rocker jockey?
",30,6,1,6,Mom,Amy1230,Amy," Guh! It's Mom. The world's most huggable industrialist.
",57,6,1,6,Fry,Mom1231,Mom,"  Call me old-fashioned, but when my robot starts to squeak like an old screen door, well, that's when I reach for a can of Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil.
",155,6,1,6,Amy,Bender1232,Bender," Mmm, tasty!
",13,6,1,6,Mom,Mom1233,Mom,"  And remember: Mom's oil is made with 10% more love than the next leading brand!

",72,6,1,6,Mom,Fry1235,Fry," Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil.
",62,6,1,6,Announcer #1,Bender1236,Bender," I'm boned.
",12,6,1,6,Fry,Smitty1237,Smitty," Freeze, scuzzbot!
",19,6,1,6,Bender,Bender1238,Bender," Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here.  I'm sure there's--  I say I'm sure there's--  That is, I'm sure there's ... a very ... reasonable--
",158,6,1,6,Smitty,Amy1239,Amy," Do we have enough money to pay Bender's fine?
",47,6,1,6,Bender,Fry1240,Fry,"  78, 79, 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents short.
",45,6,1,6,Amy,Leela1241,Leela," I'd love to chip in but Bender stole my wallet.
",49,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1242,Fry," Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's still open.
",57,6,1,6,Leela,Teller1243,Teller," Hmm. We don't seem to have your retina scan, your fingerprint or your colonic map on file.
",92,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1244,Fry," Yeah, well, I did open the account over a thousand years ago. What about my ATM card?
",87,6,1,6,Teller,Teller1245,Teller," Do you still remember your PIN number?
",40,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1246,Fry," Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza.
",101,6,1,6,Teller,Teller1247,Teller," OK, you had a balance of 93 cents...
",38,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1248,Fry," Alright!
",10,6,1,6,Teller,Teller1249,Teller," And at an average of two-and-a-quarter percent interest over a period of 1000 years, that comes to ... $4.3 billion.
",118,6,1,6,Fry,Hermes1250,Hermes," To Fry.
",9,6,1,6,Teller,Amy1251,Amy," Cheers!
",9,6,1,6,Hermes,Leela1252,Leela," I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?
",66,6,1,6,Amy,Bender1253,Bender," Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better put on a monocle.
",95,6,1,6,Leela,Fry1254,Fry," Pizza dinner on me!  Just keep the tab under $50 million.
",59,6,1,6,Bender,Robot #1 Chef1255,Robot #1 Chef," Yo!  I haven't got all day. What kind of pizza yous guys want?
",64,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1256,Fry," Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything but anchovies and one with my all time favourite topping, anchovies!
",111,6,1,6,Robot #1 Chef,Robot #1 Chef1257,Robot #1 Chef,"  Invalid selection.  Yo, what are you talking about?
",54,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1258,Fry," Anchovies? You know? Those little headless fish?
",50,6,1,6,Robot #1 Chef,Robot #1 Chef1259,Robot #1 Chef,"  Does not compute. Does not compute.
",38,6,1,6,Fry,Farnsworth1260,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has been extinct since the 2200's.
",68,6,1,6,Robot #1 Chef,Fry1261,Fry," What?
",7,6,1,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1262,Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes. Fished to death. Just about the time your people arrived on Earth wasn't it, Zoidberg?
",101,6,1,6,Fry,Zoidberg1263,Zoidberg,"  I'm not on trial here.
",25,6,1,6,Farnsworth,Fry1264,Fry," So none of you has ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing. They were all salty and oily and they melted in your mouth and--
",150,6,1,6,Zoidberg,Zoidberg1265,Zoidberg," Stop! Stop! I admit it! My people ate them all! We kept saying ""One more can't hurt"" and then they were gone. We're sorry!
",124,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1266,Fry," I just wish I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may be rich but I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.
",147,6,1,6,Zoidberg,Bender1267,Bender," Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are.  Huh? Huh?
",59,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1268,Fry," So? What do you think?
",24,6,1,6,Bender,Leela1269,Leela," I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive.  The floors are made of such hard wood.
",121,6,1,6,Fry,Bender1270,Bender," Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!
",51,6,1,6,Leela,Fry1271,Fry," What's wrong with it?
",23,6,1,6,Bender,Bender1272,Bender," Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition picture.
",87,6,1,6,Fry,Amy1273,Amy," That's true. On a TV like this I bet you couldn't even make out my obscene tattoo.
",84,6,1,6,Bender,Leela1274,Leela," That's cute!
",14,6,1,6,Amy,Auctioneer1275,Auctioneer," Sold!
",7,6,1,6,Leela,Fry1276,Fry," Yes!
",6,6,1,6,Auctioneer,Leela1277,Leela," I just don't get it. Who was this Ted Danson, and why would you pay $10,000 for his skeleton?
",95,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1278,Fry," I have an idea for a sitcom.
",30,6,1,6,Leela,Bender1279,Bender," Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money. It's OK.
",83,6,1,6,Fry,Leela1280,Leela," You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy.
",71,6,1,6,Bender,Bender1281,Bender," Yeah, it is cute.
",19,6,1,6,Leela,Auctioneer1282,Auctioneer," Now, our final item: This unopened can of Angry Norwegian brand anchovies circa 1997.
",87,6,1,6,Bender,Fry1283,Fry," Anchovies?
",12,6,1,6,Auctioneer,Auctioneer1284,Auctioneer," The last known can in existence guaranteed fresh and edible. Do I hear $10,000?
",81,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1285,Fry," 15,000!

",9,6,1,6,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1,Leela1289,Leela," Are you crazy? It's a can of old fish.
",40,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1290,Fry," Don't tell me how to spend my money.
",38,6,1,6,Leela,Auctioneer1291,Auctioneer," 50 going once, twice--
",24,6,1,6,Fry,Mom1292,Mom," 75,000.
",9,6,1,6,Auctioneer,Leela1293,Leela," Oh, my God! It's Mom! I've never seen her in person before.
",61,6,1,6,Mom,Fry1294,Fry," 100,000.
",10,6,1,6,Leela,Leela1295,Leela," Fry, you can't bid against Mom; she's the richest, most powerful person in the world. And she's so adorable.
",110,6,1,6,Fry,Mom1296,Mom," Well, I suppose I could go as high as ... 300,000.
",52,6,1,6,Leela,Fry1297,Fry," 500!
",6,6,1,6,Mom,Mom1298,Mom," Oh, mercy be. A million.
",26,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1299,Fry," Two.
",6,6,1,6,Mom,Mom1300,Mom," Six.
",6,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1301,Fry," 14!
",5,6,1,6,Mom,Mom1302,Mom," I can see the nice young man really wants those little fish. Nevertheless, I'll bid 23 million.
",97,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1303,Fry," One jillion dollars.
",22,6,1,6,Mom,Auctioneer1304,Auctioneer," Sir, that's not a number.
",27,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1305,Fry," Oh. In that case, 50 million.
",31,6,1,6,Auctioneer,Mom1306,Mom," Well, boys, your old mother knows when she's been beat.  You win, young man. I tip my bonnet to you.
",102,6,1,6,Fry,Bidder #11307,Bidder #1," Isn't she adorable?
",21,6,1,6,Mom,Bidder #21308,Bidder #2," Isn't she sweet?
",18,6,1,6,Bidder #1,Auctioneer1309,Auctioneer," What a class act! Sold! To the gentleman who bought every item in today's auction.
",84,6,1,6,Bidder #2,Fry1310,Fry," Now for some good old 20th century TV.
",40,6,1,6,Auctioneer,Announcer #11311,Announcer #1,"  Do you remember a time when chocolate chip cookies came fresh from the oven? Petridge Farm remembers.
",104,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1312,Fry," Ah, those were the days.
",26,6,1,6,Announcer #1,Announcer #11313,Announcer #1,"  Do you remember a time when women couldn't vote and certain folk weren't allowed on golf courses? Petridge Farm remembers.
",125,6,1,6,Fry,Leela1314,Leela,"  Fry? Are you there?
",22,6,1,6,Announcer #1,Fry1315,Fry," Eh?
",5,6,1,6,Leela,Leela1316,Leela," You haven't been to work in three days. What have you been doing?
",67,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1317,Fry," I've been sitting right here. I picked up my life exactly where I left off a thousand years ago. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's eight o'clock. Time to get biz-ay!
",164,6,1,6,Leela,Leela1318,Leela," You can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
",67,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1319,Fry," I could if you hadn't turned on the lights and shut off the stereo.
",69,6,1,6,Leela,Leela1320,Leela," Fry, this isn't healthy. You're living in the past.
",53,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1321,Fry," I'm rich! I can live whenever I want.
",39,6,1,6,Leela,Leela1322,Leela," But we're your friends and we live here in the year 3000.
",59,6,1,6,Fry,Bender1323,Bender," Yeah! Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk?
",106,6,1,6,Leela,Fry1324,Fry," Junk? Maybe you can't understand this, but I've finally found what I need to be happy and it's not friends, it's things.
",122,6,1,6,Bender,Bender1325,Bender,"  I'm a thing.
",15,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1326,Fry," Just leave me alone.
",22,6,1,6,Bender,Leela1327,Leela," Fry, please--   My ponytail's caught in the door.
",51,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1328,Fry," I don't need them. Not when I have my antique videos, my bucket of fossilised KFC and 50 million dollars worth of anchovies.
",126,6,1,6,Leela,Mom1329,Mom," Mercy me, what a day.
",23,6,1,6,Fry,Mom1330,Mom," Could you shut the door, Igner, dear? I think I feel a draught coming on.  Holy crap, that bastard's itchy!  Walt! Cream soda!
",128,6,1,6,Mom,Walt1331,Walt," Right away, mother. Larry, get your mother a cream soda.
",58,6,1,6,Mom,Larry1332,Larry," But, Mom said--
",17,6,1,6,Walt,Walt1333,Walt," You heard me.
",15,6,1,6,Larry,Igner1334,Igner," What's wrong, Mommy?
",22,6,1,6,Walt,Mom1335,Mom," It's those damned anchovies. That dirtbag, Fry, must know their secret. And I won't rest until I get my hands on them. No one messes with Mom!
",144,6,1,6,Igner,Walt1336,Walt," Quiet, you!
",13,6,1,6,Mom,Mom1337,Mom," As you boys know, one of the cornerstones of my empire is Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil. Think of it: 10 billion robots, each one needing an oil change every 3000 miles. You don't have to do the math to know that's a buttload of oil.
",235,6,1,6,Walt,Igner1338,Igner," Can I wear your fat suit?
",27,6,1,6,Mom,Mom1339,Mom,"  No, Igner, put that down!
",28,6,1,6,Igner,Walt1340,Walt," What does this have to do with the anchovies?
",47,6,1,6,Mom,Mom1341,Mom," I'm getting to the freaking anchovies.  A single drop of the anchovies' natural oil would lubricate 10 robots permanently.
",124,6,1,6,Walt,Larry1342,Larry," Wow, it's a shame they went extinct.
",38,6,1,6,Mom,Mom1343,Mom,"  No, it isn't! Shut your filthy trap!   Thank you, Walt. If anyone ever got a hold of anchovy DNA, they could chop out the oil-making gene, stick it in a bunch of Third-World kids and bam! Cheap effective robot oil. Enough to put dear, old Mom out of businness.
",263,6,1,6,Larry,Walt1344,Walt," My God! This Mr. Fry must be a mastermind of the highest order.
",65,6,1,6,Mom,Fred1345,Fred,"  Esther, you ugly!
",20,6,1,6,Walt,Mom1346,Mom," We have only one option: We'll have to bankrupt Mr. Fry, so he'll be forced to sell the anchovies to us.
",106,6,1,6,Fred,Walt1347,Walt," Mother, you are one clever old skag!
",38,6,1,6,Mom,Mom1348,Mom," And don't you forget it!
",26,6,1,6,Walt,Larry1349,Larry," But how are we supposed to get Fry's money out of the bank?
",61,6,1,6,Mom,Mom1350,Mom," That part will be easy, thanks to the nice people at Mom's Old Fashioned Video Surveillance Unit.
",99,6,1,6,Larry,Teller1351,Teller,"  Do you still remember your PIN number?
",41,6,1,6,Mom,Fry1352,Fry,"  Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza.  It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda--
",155,6,1,6,Teller,Mom1353,Mom," You know what needs to be done.
",33,6,1,6,Fry,Larry1354,Larry," What?
",7,6,1,6,Mom,Mom1355,Mom,"  Get his PIN number, you idiots!   Now I'm off to some charity BS for knocked-up teenage sluts.
",97,6,1,6,Larry,Walt1356,Walt,"  Mr. Fry, it's those three plumbers you called for.
",53,6,1,6,Mom,Larry1357,Larry,"  We're here to tighten your drain.
",36,6,1,6,Walt,Fry1358,Fry," I didn't order any--
",22,6,1,6,Larry,Walt1359,Walt," Quick! Give him the tranquilliser.
",36,6,1,6,Fry,Larry1360,Larry," That's a good boy.
",20,6,1,6,Walt,Walt1361,Walt," Wake up, Mr. Fry.
",19,6,1,6,Larry,Fry1362,Fry," Where am I?
",13,6,1,6,Walt,Walt1363,Walt," You're in the good old year 2000, working here at Panucci's Pizza. You fell asleep on the job.
",96,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1364,Fry," That sounds like me but I thought I got frozen. Wasn't I in the future?
",73,6,1,6,Walt,Walt1365,Walt," No, you only ""dreamed"" you were in the year 3000.
",51,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1366,Fry," So I'm really back? That's exactly what I wanted, I guess. Who are you?
",73,6,1,6,Walt,Walt1367,Walt," I'm Mr. Panucci.
",18,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1368,Fry," You are? Did you grow a moustache since last night?
",53,6,1,6,Walt,Walt1369,Walt," No. Now go work the currency register, I think I hear a customer coming.  I said, ""I think I hear a customer coming""!
",119,6,1,6,Fry,Anderson1370,Anderson," Hurry up, please. I wanna get back to the Head Museum.
",56,6,1,6,Walt,Larry1371,Larry," Don't worry, Miss Anderson, this won't take long. Now, your motivation is you're back in the year 2000 and your head's still on your body, and you want a cheese pizza.
",169,6,1,6,Anderson,Anderson1372,Anderson," OK. But I'm only doing this so people will take my head seriously as an actress.
",82,6,1,6,Larry,Fry1373,Fry," Hey, look! Anchovies!
",23,6,1,6,Anderson,Walt1374,Walt," Of course. They're not extinct yet. And if you need further proof that this is really a thousand years ago, well, here's contemporary actress, Pamela Anderson!
",161,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1375,Fry," Ooh!
",6,6,1,6,Walt,Anderson1376,Anderson," Hello, Fry. Remember me from Baywatch: The Movie?
",51,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1377,Fry," Uh...
",7,6,1,6,Anderson,Anderson1378,Anderson," It was the first movie to be shot entirely in slow-motion.
",60,6,1,6,Fry,Walt1379,Walt,"  It hasn't been made yet.
",27,6,1,6,Anderson,Anderson1380,Anderson,"  Then he doesn't know I won the Oscar?
",40,6,1,6,Walt,Walt1381,Walt," Nope.
",7,6,1,6,Anderson,Anderson1382,Anderson," Crap!
",7,6,1,6,Walt,Fry1383,Fry," Wait. You're Pamela Anderson! Cool! What can I get you?
",57,6,1,6,Anderson,Anderson1384,Anderson," Oh, I'll have a cheese pizza and a large ... uh ... line?
",59,6,1,6,Fry,Larry1385,Larry,"  Soda!
",8,6,1,6,Anderson,Anderson1386,Anderson," Oh, right! Cheese pizza and a large soda!
",43,6,1,6,Larry,Fry1387,Fry," Uh, cheese and a--  That was quick!
",37,6,1,6,Anderson,Anderson1388,Anderson," So. What do I owe you?
",24,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1389,Fry," 10.77. Same as my PIN number.
",31,6,1,6,Anderson,Igner1390,Igner," Hey! You don't get to laugh.
",30,6,1,6,Fry,Igner1391,Igner," Thanks a billion!
",19,6,1,6,Igner,Larry1392,Larry," More like 4.3 billion!
",24,6,1,6,Igner,Igner1393,Igner," Ow!
",5,6,1,6,Larry,Larry1394,Larry," Ow!
",5,6,1,6,Igner,Fry1395,Fry," Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed. I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're really here.
",124,6,1,6,Larry,Leela1396,Leela," Since when do you care about us?
",34,6,1,6,Fry,Bender1397,Bender," We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs about the buttocks.
",92,6,1,6,Leela,Fry1398,Fry," No, that's not true!
",22,6,1,6,Bender,Leela1399,Leela," Goodbye-ee!
",13,6,1,6,Fry,Bender1400,Bender," Whee!
",7,6,1,6,Leela,Announcer #11401,Announcer #1,"  This dream brought to you by Lightspeed briefs.
",50,6,1,6,Bender,Fry1402,Fry," Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait a minute! Hey, buddy, what year is this?
",78,6,1,6,Announcer #1,Repo-bot1403,Repo-bot," Uh, 3000.
",11,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1404,Fry," 3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! Life is wonderful!  Wait! What are you doing with my stuff?
",97,6,1,6,Repo-bot,Repo-bot1405,Repo-bot," Uh, cheque bounced. We're taking it all back.
",47,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1406,Fry," Oh, no! My ATM card! My secret PIN number -- 1077. I've got nothing left. Except...
",85,6,1,6,Repo-bot,Leela1407,Leela," You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?
",66,6,1,6,Fry,Farnsworth1408,Farnsworth," Uh, wha? Oh, yes! They say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad! And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters. Atomic supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies that suck blood out of...
",219,6,1,6,Leela,Fry1409,Fry," Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!
",38,6,1,6,Farnsworth,Leela1410,Leela," You did? What happened?
",25,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1411,Fry," I was robbed. They got everything except these.
",49,6,1,6,Leela,Bender1412,Bender," Who did?
",10,6,1,6,Fry,Mom1413,Mom," Hello, Fry.
",13,6,1,6,Bender,Leela1414,Leela," It's Mom!
",11,6,1,6,Mom,Mom1415,Mom," I felt terrible when I heard about your money troubles and I thought maybe I could help out a sweet, young man by buying his anchovies.
",137,6,1,6,Leela,Fry1416,Fry," Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.
",43,6,1,6,Mom,Mom1417,Mom," What? Listen, you little bastard. I control the robot oil business and I won't let you ruin me. How much do you want?
",119,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1418,Fry," You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered something even more important: My friends. And they aren't worth even a penny to me.  That's why these anchovies are going on a pizza, so I can share the food I love with the people I like.
",259,6,1,6,Mom,Mom1419,Mom," Holy hell! You're going to eat them? Oh, well. Just make sure you eat them all, you're a growing boy. Toodle-oo!  Dumb ass!
",125,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1420,Fry," What a nice lady!
",19,6,1,6,Mom,Fry1421,Fry," OK, my friends. Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted.
",85,6,1,6,Fry,Amy1422,Amy," I don't know, I've had cow.  Ew! Gross!
",41,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1423,Fry," Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll grow on you.
",57,6,1,6,Amy,Zoidberg1424,Zoidberg," That stench. That heavenly stench!  More!
",43,6,1,6,Fry,Fry1425,Fry," There aren't any more. And there never will be.
",49,6,1,6,Zoidberg,Zoidberg1426,Zoidberg," More! More! More! More!
",25,6,1,6,Fry,Bender1427,Bender,"  Going through the 'bot wash!
",31,7,1,7,Zoidberg,Bender1428,Bender,"  Goin' through the robot wash!
C'mon, y'all and sing it with me,
'Bot wash! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
'Bot wash, yeah!
",124,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1429,Bender," Ah!
",5,7,1,7,Bender,Elzar1430,Elzar,"  Hey, I'm Elzar! Welcome to the show! You know, you don't have to drive all the way to Neptune for great Neptunian food. Today we're gonna kick it up a notch as I show you how to fricassee a mouth-watering Neptunian slug.  Now, while you grease the pan and preheat your oven to 3500 degrees, you're gonna separate the yolk from your genetically-enhanced eggplant and then give the whole thing a good blast from your spice weasel. Bam!
",436,7,1,7,Bender,Fry1431,Fry," Hey, what you watching?
",25,7,1,7,Elzar,Bender1432,Bender," Uh, nothing!
",14,7,1,7,Fry,Leela1433,Leela," Is that a cooking show?
",25,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1434,Bender," No, of course not! It was ... uh ... porno! Yeah, that's it!
",62,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1435,Leela," Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!
",58,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1436,Bender,"  Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long.
",50,7,1,7,Leela,Fry1437,Fry," It's OK, Bender. I like cooking too.
",38,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1438,Bender,"  Pansy!
",9,7,1,7,Fry,Elzar1439,Elzar,"  Of course, your most important ingredient is this baby right here: The Neptunian slug. You can get it in a can but to really do things right you gotta strangle yourself a fresh one.  Now this is why you gotta use cast-iron cookware.
",235,7,1,7,Bender,Hermes1440,Hermes," Bender, man. It has come to my attention that this company has been paying you to do nothing but loaf about on the couch.
",123,7,1,7,Elzar,Bender1441,Bender," You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
",43,7,1,7,Hermes,Hermes1442,Hermes," I'm sorry but if you want to continue drawing a salary you gotta do more than watch the cooking shows all day.
",112,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1443,Bender," Hmm.
",6,7,1,7,Hermes,Fry1444,Fry," You're gonna be the ships cook?
",33,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1445,Bender," Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!
",44,7,1,7,Fry,Leela1446,Leela," I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have a sense of taste.
",89,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1447,Bender," Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top.
",76,7,1,7,Leela,Fry1448,Fry," Bam!
",6,7,1,7,Bender,Fry1449,Fry," So this is Little Neptune?
",28,7,1,7,Fry,Bender1450,Bender," Yep. Every chef knows that this is the place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.
",81,7,1,7,Fry,Leela1451,Leela," Among other things.
",21,7,1,7,Bender,Crack Addict1452,Crack Addict," Come on, man! Don't hold out on me like this!
",47,7,1,7,Leela,Organ Dealer1453,Organ Dealer," Psst! You want to buy organ?  Fresh and cheap. Ready for transplant!
",70,7,1,7,Crack Addict,Fry1454,Fry,"  Ooh! What's this?
",20,7,1,7,Organ Dealer,Organ Dealer1455,Organ Dealer," Ah! Is X-Ray eyes. See through anything!
",42,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1456,Fry," Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.
",33,7,1,7,Organ Dealer,Organ Dealer1457,Organ Dealer," Z is just as good. In fact, is better. Is two more than X.
",60,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1458,Fry," Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?
",68,7,1,7,Organ Dealer,Leela1459,Leela," Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You don't know how things work here.
",103,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1460,Fry," I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people.  What up?
",85,7,1,7,Leela,Alien1461,Alien," Word!
",7,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1462,Fry," See?
",6,7,1,7,Alien,Fry1463,Fry," Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat here except human!
",58,7,1,7,Fry,Neptunian Salesman #1 #11464,Neptunian Salesman #1 #1," What? You want human?
",23,7,1,7,Fry,Leela1465,Leela," What's this spice for?
",24,7,1,7,Neptunian Salesman #1 #1,Neptunian Salesman #1 #21466,Neptunian Salesman #1 #2," That's powdered swamp root. Makes you irresistible to the opposite sex.
",73,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1467,Leela," Oh, that's ridiculous!  I'll take two pounds!
",47,7,1,7,Neptunian Salesman #1 #2,Bender1468,Bender," Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug.
",41,7,1,7,Leela,Neptunian Salesman #1 #11469,Neptunian Salesman #1 #1," Yellow or purple?
",19,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1470,Bender," Whatever.
",11,7,1,7,Neptunian Salesman #1 #1,Neptunian Salesman #1 #11471,Neptunian Salesman #1 #1," The purple one causes terrible nightmare-ish diarrhoea.
",57,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1472,Bender," Yeah, yeah. Either one's fine.
",32,7,1,7,Neptunian Salesman #1 #1,Leela1473,Leela," Hey, have you seen Fry?
",25,7,1,7,Bender,Fry1474,Fry," Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills.
",97,7,1,7,Leela,Organ Dealer1475,Organ Dealer," Yes, gills. Then, uh, you don't need lungs anymore, is right?
",63,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1476,Fry," Can't imagine why I would.
",28,7,1,7,Organ Dealer,Organ Dealer1477,Organ Dealer," Lie down on table. I take lungs now, gills come next week.   Nurse!
",69,7,1,7,Fry,Nurse1478,Nurse," Let's do it.
",14,7,1,7,Organ Dealer,Organ Dealer1479,Organ Dealer," You may feel small pain--
",27,7,1,7,Nurse,Bender1480,Bender,"  Thank you!
",13,7,1,7,Organ Dealer,Leela1481,Leela," What the hell were you doing? I warned you to stay away from those guys.
",74,7,1,7,Bender,Fry1482,Fry," I'm capable of making my own decisions, Leela. Did you ever stop to think I might be happier with gills?
",106,7,1,7,Leela,Farnsworth1483,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone--
",23,7,1,7,Fry,Bender1484,Bender," Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.
",40,7,1,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1485,Farnsworth," You'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol...
",53,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1486,Bender," Here it comes.
",16,7,1,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1487,Farnsworth," A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.
",65,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1488,Bender," Thank you, and goodnight.
",27,7,1,7,Farnsworth,Leela1489,Leela," Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?
",59,7,1,7,Bender,Farnsworth1490,Farnsworth," Why, of course! It's just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone of No Return. All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy of Terror!
",141,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1491,Leela," Uh, Professor--
",17,7,1,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1492,Farnsworth," Off you go. Pleasant trip!
",28,7,1,7,Leela,Fry1493,Fry,"  Hey, Bender, how's dinner coming?
",36,7,1,7,Farnsworth,Bender1494,Bender,"  Almost ready!
",16,7,1,7,Fry,Bender1495,Bender," Now for a dash of salt!  Uh-oh!
",33,7,1,7,Bender,Leela1496,Leela,"  Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive. So let's be supportive, OK?
",95,7,1,7,Bender,Fry1497,Fry," Yeah, OK.
",11,7,1,7,Leela,Zoidberg1498,Zoidberg," Alright.
",10,7,1,7,Fry,Leela1499,Leela,"  Oh, dear God!
",16,7,1,7,Zoidberg,Fry1500,Fry," That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I've once ate a big, heaping bowl of salt!
",92,7,1,7,Leela,Amy1501,Amy," Bender, is this salt water?
",29,7,1,7,Fry,Bender1502,Bender," It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.
",53,7,1,7,Amy,Fry1503,Fry," My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.
",44,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1504,Bender," There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
",89,7,1,7,Fry,Zoidberg1505,Zoidberg," Uh-oh! I shouldn't have had seconds.
",38,7,1,7,Bender,Leela1506,Leela," OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver. And for once in your life be careful. This is my first visit to the Galaxy of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one.
",164,7,1,7,Zoidberg,Fry1507,Fry," Ow!
",5,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1508,Leela," Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come right back.
",97,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1509,Fry," Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing.
",102,7,1,7,Leela,Fry1510,Fry," Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty.  Oh, come on! Go down already!  Ah!
",78,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1511,Fry," Hello? Anybody home?
",22,7,1,7,Fry,Guard #1 #11512,Guard #1 #1," The royal bottle is empty!
",28,7,1,7,Fry,Guard #1 #21513,Guard #1 #2," You drank our Emperor!
",24,7,1,7,Guard #1 #1,Fry1514,Fry," No! It wasn't me!
",19,7,1,7,Guard #1 #2,Guard #1 #11515,Guard #1 #1,"  You drank our Emperor! You assassinated him!
",47,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1516,Fry," I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.
",58,7,1,7,Guard #1 #1,Guard #1 #31517,Guard #1 #3," I'm sure he was.
",18,7,1,7,Fry,Guard #1 #11518,Guard #1 #1," But now he's gone and your fate is sealed. All hail the new Emperor.
",70,7,1,7,Guard #1 #3,Guard #1s1519,Guard #1s,"  Hail! Hail! Hail!
",20,7,1,7,Guard #1 #1,Leela1520,Leela," So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!
",136,7,1,7,Guard #1s,Fry1521,Fry," It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.
",70,7,1,7,Leela,Merg1522,Merg," Excuse me, Your Majesty, I am Merg, the High Priest. If I might interject?
",76,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1523,Fry," You might.
",12,7,1,7,Merg,Merg1524,Merg," I humbly advise that as your first act you choose a capable Prime Minister. I suggest Gorgak, the previous appointee.
",119,7,1,7,Fry,Gorgak1525,Gorgak," I will be a forceful and effective administrator.
",51,7,1,7,Merg,Bender1526,Bender," You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister.
",68,7,1,7,Gorgak,Fry1527,Fry," I gotta go with Bender.
",25,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1528,Bender," Yes! In your face, Gorgak!
",28,7,1,7,Fry,Leela1529,Leela," That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are in way over your head.
",94,7,1,7,Bender,Fry1530,Fry," Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister.
",70,7,1,7,Leela,Bender1531,Bender," Stay the course, pal!
",23,7,1,7,Fry,Gorgak1532,Gorgak," Your Highness, a package came for you.
",40,7,1,7,Bender,Fry1533,Fry," Hey, thanks!  Wow! This got here just in time.
",48,7,1,7,Gorgak,Merg1534,Merg," This is Your Majesty's harem. You may choose any of these maidens to be your royal consort.
",93,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1535,Fry," Um, how about that one?
",25,7,1,7,Merg,Merg1536,Merg," Oh! I didn't realise Your Majesty was into that sort of thing!
",64,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1537,Fry," On second thought, I'll take that one.
",40,7,1,7,Merg,Merg1538,Merg," Hey, whatever you say. I'm not here to pass judgement.
",56,7,1,7,Fry,Leela1539,Leela," Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy could drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?
",156,7,1,7,Merg,Fry1540,Fry," You don't have to beat around the bush, Leela. We all know who you're talking about ... uh, me, right?
",104,7,1,7,Leela,Amy1541,Amy," I don't think you have anything to worry about. These people seem really mild-mannered.
",89,7,1,7,Fry,Zoidberg1542,Zoidberg," They are mild. In fact, you're soaking in one right now.
",58,7,1,7,Amy,Gorgak1543,Gorgak," You touched me in ways I've never been touched before.
",56,7,1,7,Zoidberg,Merg1544,Merg," Ah, there you are, Your Majesty. It's time to begin preparing for tomorrow's coronation ceremony.
",99,7,1,7,Gorgak,Zoidberg1545,Zoidberg," A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal shell.
",48,7,1,7,Merg,Merg1546,Merg," Fry will be enthroned tomorrow at the setting of the three suns when we Trisolians enter our nocturnal phase.
",111,7,1,7,Zoidberg,Fry1547,Fry," There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?
",59,7,1,7,Merg,Merg1548,Merg," Only one. The absolutely flawless recitation from memory of the royal oath. By you.
",85,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1549,Fry," Will there be cake?
",21,7,1,7,Merg,Zoidberg1550,Zoidberg," Yeah, I know.
",15,7,1,7,Fry,Amy1551,Amy,"  Hi!
",6,7,1,7,Zoidberg,Fry1552,Fry," There you go.
",15,7,1,7,Amy,Gorgak1553,Gorgak," And now, get ready to laugh till your sides leak with our planet's foremost political satirist, Florp!
",104,7,1,7,Fry,Florp1554,Florp," So what is the deal with people from under the orange sun? They're all...  But us guys from under the red sun, we're like...  Right? Am I right?
",146,7,1,7,Gorgak,Fry1555,Fry," Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!
",29,7,1,7,Florp,Leela1556,Leela,"  Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger.
",57,7,1,7,Fry,Leela1557,Leela," You see Emperor Plon here?  He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab.
",147,7,1,7,Leela,Fry1558,Fry," So?
",5,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1559,Leela," Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?
",91,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1560,Fry," 80,000 years?
",15,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1561,Leela," No. One week.
",15,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1562,Fry," Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
",79,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1563,Leela," Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next?
",90,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1564,Fry," Well, at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.
",59,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1565,Leela," You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation.
",100,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1566,Fry," Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself.
",46,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1567,Leela," No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory.
",124,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1568,Fry," Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later.
",48,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1569,Leela," That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?
",58,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1570,Fry," Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?
",443,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1571,Leela," I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save you.
",88,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1572,Fry," Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts, you nagging grasshopper.
",133,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1573,Leela," That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in the ship.
",93,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1574,Fry," I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me.  Quit it!
",64,7,1,7,Leela,Merg1575,Merg," People of Trisol, it is my honour to present your new Emperor.
",64,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1576,Fry," What up?
",10,7,1,7,Merg,Merg1577,Merg," Stick to the oath.
",20,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1578,Fry," Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant...
",103,7,1,7,Merg,Fry1579,Fry,"  Who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity-- Uh, integrity!
",159,7,1,7,Fry,Merg1580,Merg," Congratulations, Your Highness.  I now present you with your royal unisex robe. Long live Fry the Solid!
",106,7,1,7,Fry,Bender1581,Bender," Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!
",71,7,1,7,Merg,Bender1582,Bender," Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?
",65,7,1,7,Bender,Merg1583,Merg," The Emperor Bont! He's still alive.
",37,7,1,7,Bender,Bont1584,Bont," Of course I'm alive. Now cut this creep open and drain me out!
",64,7,1,7,Merg,Fry1585,Fry," My tummy hurts!
",17,7,1,7,Bont,Bont1586,Bont," They're over here, they're running up the stairs.
",51,7,1,7,Fry,Bender1587,Bender," Shut up, you!
",15,7,1,7,Bont,Fry1588,Fry," Ow!
",5,7,1,7,Bender,Merg1589,Merg," Let us in!
",12,7,1,7,Fry,Merg1590,Merg,"  Fry must die so that Bont may live.
",38,7,1,7,Merg,Fry1591,Fry," What am I gonna do?
",21,7,1,7,Merg,Amy1592,Amy," We've gotta get the Emperor out of your body before they kill you!
",68,7,1,7,Fry,Zoidberg1593,Zoidberg," Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge, separating out the denser fluid of His Highness.
",111,7,1,7,Amy,Fry1594,Fry," But won't that crush my bones?
",32,7,1,7,Zoidberg,Zoidberg1595,Zoidberg," Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones.
",68,7,1,7,Fry,Bender1596,Bender," Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?
",40,7,1,7,Zoidberg,Bont1597,Bont," Forget it! As Emperor I refuse to be dripped out through somebody's armpit.
",77,7,1,7,Bender,Fry1598,Fry," I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?
",61,7,1,7,Bont,Bont1599,Bont," Slightly. But my favourite so far is the bone-crushing.
",57,7,1,7,Fry,Amy1600,Amy," What about crying?
",20,7,1,7,Bont,Fry1601,Fry," That's a great idea! Crying.
",30,7,1,7,Amy,Bont1602,Bont," Fine. That or the bone one.
",29,7,1,7,Fry,Merg1603,Merg," Keep it up, men. The veneer is starting to peel.
",50,7,1,7,Bont,Gorgak1604,Gorgak," Oh, dear!
",11,7,1,7,Merg,Fry1605,Fry," It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
",50,7,1,7,Gorgak,Bender1606,Bender," I'll make you cry, buddy!  You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything.
",98,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1607,Fry," What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.
",52,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1608,Bender," Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder: Everyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.
",103,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1609,Fry," These things happen.
",22,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1610,Bender," OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!
",106,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1611,Fry," Phew! That's a load off my mind.
",34,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1612,Bender," Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry.
",62,7,1,7,Fry,Amy1613,Amy," You did your best, Bender.
",28,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1614,Bender," Up yours, bimbo!
",18,7,1,7,Amy,Zoidberg1615,Zoidberg," Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help.
",73,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1616,Bender," Cram it, lobster!  That is a good idea. I'll go call her.
",59,7,1,7,Zoidberg,Fry1617,Fry," She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.
",73,7,1,7,Bender,Amy1618,Amy," C'mon. Leela's not the type to hold a grudge.
",47,7,1,7,Fry,Operator1619,Operator,"  Collect call from...
",23,7,1,7,Amy,Bender1620,Bender,"  I'm not giving my name to a machine.
",39,7,1,7,Operator,Leela1621,Leela," I'll accept.
",14,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1622,Bender,"  Fry's in trouble...
",22,7,1,7,Leela,Bender1623,Bender," And he needs help. Now, I don't like you and you don't like me.
",65,7,1,7,Bender,Leela1624,Leela,"  I like you.
",14,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1625,Bender," You do? Look, are you going to help or not?
",45,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1626,Leela,"  I don't know why I should. I mean after what he--
",52,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1627,Bender," Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What is it you like best about me?
",61,7,1,7,Leela,Amy1628,Amy," Is she coming?
",16,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1629,Bender," I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.
",70,7,1,7,Amy,Fry1630,Fry," What the hell is that?
",24,7,1,7,Bender,Bont1631,Bont," Its the Juice-A-Matic 4000. It'll strain my juices from you while filtering out the pulp. By which I mean, your shredded remains.
",131,7,1,7,Fry,Zoidberg1632,Zoidberg," Of course! Why didn't I think of that!
",40,7,1,7,Bont,Fry1633,Fry," This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.
",60,7,1,7,Zoidberg,Bender1634,Bender," Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
",34,7,1,7,Fry,Amy1635,Amy," Oh, no! They have her totally outnumbered.
",44,7,1,7,Bender,Fry1636,Fry," I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
",119,7,1,7,Amy,Bender1637,Bender," You do? Hmm.
",14,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1638,Fry," Is she alright?
",17,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1639,Bender," I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her.
",105,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1640,Fry," No. No!
",9,7,1,7,Bender,Amy1641,Amy," What are you talking about, Bender? She's al--   Oh!
",54,7,1,7,Fry,Bender1642,Bender," They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it.
",92,7,1,7,Amy,Fry1643,Fry," This can't be happening.
",26,7,1,7,Bender,Bender1644,Bender," It can and, for all you know, it is.  I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.
",67,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1645,Fry," All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept it.  I wish I had died instead of her.
",122,7,1,7,Bender,Leela1646,Leela," What are you talking about?
",29,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1647,Fry," Leela! You're alive!
",22,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1648,Leela," Of course I'm alive.
",22,7,1,7,Fry,Bender1649,Bender," I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving.
",103,7,1,7,Leela,Amy1650,Amy," We only got two drops.
",24,7,1,7,Bender,Bont1651,Bont," It's only a matter of time now.
",33,7,1,7,Amy,Zoidberg1652,Zoidberg," I'll handle this!
",19,7,1,7,Bont,Leela1653,Leela," Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you.
",85,7,1,7,Zoidberg,Fry1654,Fry," Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey, come on!  That hurt!
",168,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1655,Leela," I know. Amy, get the bottle.
",30,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1656,Fry,"  Oh, now I understand.
",24,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1657,Leela," Come on. Everybody help out Fry.
",34,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1658,Fry,"  Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true-- Ow! Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!
",103,7,1,7,Leela,Leela1659,Leela," How we doing, Amy?
",20,7,1,7,Fry,Amy1660,Amy," Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
",42,7,1,7,Leela,Amy1661,Amy," OK, it's your turn.
",21,7,1,7,Amy,Fry1662,Fry," Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?
",34,7,1,7,Amy,Bont1663,Bont," I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me out.
",44,7,1,7,Fry,Fry1664,Fry," Oh, you're welcome.
",21,7,1,7,Bont,Bender1665,Bender,"  Hey! Save some for me!
",25,7,1,7,Fry,Farnsworth1666,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the virus planet.
",89,8,1,8,Bender,Hermes1667,Hermes," Why can't they go today?
",26,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1668,Farnsworth," Because tonight's a special night and I want all of you to be alive. It's the Academy of Inventors' annual symposium.
",119,8,1,8,Hermes,Fry1669,Fry," Wow! I love symposia.
",23,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1670,Farnsworth," It's the event of the scientific season. Every member presents an invention and the best one wins the Academy prize.
",118,8,1,8,Fry,Bender1671,Bender," Sounds boring.
",16,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1672,Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! The death clock.  Simply jam your finger in the hole and this read-out tells you exactly how long you have left to live.
",205,8,1,8,Bender,Leela1673,Leela," Does it really work?
",22,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1674,Farnsworth," Well it's occasionally off by a few seconds. What with free will and all.
",75,8,1,8,Leela,Fry1675,Fry," Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?
",51,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Bender1676,Bender," Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!
",29,8,1,8,Fry,Farnsworth1677,Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes.
",14,8,1,8,Bender,Fry1678,Fry," Who's the gross nerd?
",23,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1679,Farnsworth," That's me at the very first symposium. I'm the Academy's oldest living member, you know. These youngsters all look up to me.
",126,8,1,8,Fry,Wernstrom1680,Wernstrom," Well, well, well. Look who decided to show his wrinkled face.
",63,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1681,Farnsworth," Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?
",47,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Wernstrom1682,Wernstrom," Face it, Farnsworth, you're over the hill. It's time to leave science to the 120-year-olds.
",93,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1683,Farnsworth," You young turks think you know everything. I was inventing things when you were barely turning senile.
",104,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Wernstrom1684,Wernstrom," Go home before you embarrass yourself, old man. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take a nap before the ceremonies.
",122,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Fry1685,Fry," Who's that jerk?
",18,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Farnsworth1686,Farnsworth," A hundred years ago he was my most promising student at Mars University. But then, after one fateful pop-quiz...
",114,8,1,8,Fry,Wernstrom1687,Wernstrom," A-minus? No one gives Ogden Wernstrom an A-minus!
",51,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1688,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, but penmanship counts.
",35,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Wernstrom1689,Wernstrom," I swear I'll have my revenge even if it takes me a hundred years.
",67,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1690,Farnsworth," And here it is: Slightly over 99 years later and still no revenge. I'm essentially in the clear.
",98,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Bender1691,Bender," I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's Delight, the '57 Chateau PartÃ© and the '66 Thunder Chevitz.
",138,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Waiter1692,Waiter," Exquisite choices, sir.
",25,8,1,8,Bender,Bender1693,Bender," And mix them all together in a big jug.
",41,8,1,8,Waiter,Popeil1694,Popeil," Welcome to this year's Academy of Inventors Annual Symposium. I'm your host, Ron Popeil, inventor of Mr. Microphone, the spray-on toupee and, of course, the technology to keep human heads alive in jars.  But wait, there's more. We've got a whole line-up of inventors tonight, starting with that up and coming young star, Ogden Wernstrom.
",339,8,1,8,Bender,Bender1695,Bender,"  More wine!
",13,8,1,8,Popeil,Wernstrom1696,Wernstrom," Distinguished members of the Academy, I present to you, the Reverse Scuba Suit. Observe!  Fetch!  Now, sit!  I said sit!  Bad fish!
",133,8,1,8,Bender,Fry1697,Fry," Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock.
",67,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Wernstrom1698,Wernstrom," And what will you be presenting this evening, grandpa?
",56,8,1,8,Fry,Farnsworth1699,Farnsworth," Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place!
",67,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Wernstrom1700,Wernstrom," I just hope it's not as lame as that death clock you presented last year.
",75,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1701,Farnsworth," Uh, last year, you say?
",25,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Wernstrom1702,Wernstrom," That's right.
",15,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1703,Farnsworth," Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?
",61,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Wernstrom1704,Wernstrom," Hardly! We laughed until our teeth fell out. Come along, Cinnamon.
",68,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1705,Farnsworth," Oh, dear. I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps some sort of death clock.
",104,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Leela1706,Leela," Uh, Professor...?
",19,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Popeil1707,Popeil," Our last presentation comes from our oldest member, Professor Hubert Farnsworth. Professor?
",93,8,1,8,Leela,Farnsworth1708,Farnsworth," Just a second, just a second.
",31,8,1,8,Popeil,Wernstrom1709,Wernstrom," Pencils down, prune-face.
",27,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1710,Farnsworth," Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. Now, we all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects. But what if we want to smell distant objects? Well now we can! Thanks to my new invention ... the Smellescope.
",215,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Man #11711,Man #1," Oh, I say!
",12,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1712,Farnsworth," The odour travels past this coffee stain here, around the olive pit and into this cigar burn. And this appears to be a doodle of myself as a cowboy.  But the Smellescope is brilliant, I tell you! Think of the astronomical odours you'll smell thanks to me.  Oh, my!
",266,8,1,8,Man #1,Wernstrom1713,Wernstrom," I've waited a hundred years for this, Farnsworth. I give your invention the worst grade imaginable: An A-minus-minus.
",119,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Popeil1714,Popeil," And now for the presentation of the award. Listen, folks, I'm practically giving this prize away to Dr. Wernstrom, for his fish thingy.
",137,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Farnsworth1715,Farnsworth," Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.
",48,8,1,8,Popeil,Bender1716,Bender," Yep!
",6,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Fry1717,Fry," No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century when I was gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening to me? Oh, I give up!
",171,8,1,8,Bender,Farnsworth1718,Farnsworth," By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smellescope!
",60,8,1,8,Fry,Farnsworth1719,Farnsworth," Eureka!
",9,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Fry1720,Fry," Did you build the Smellescope?
",32,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1721,Farnsworth," No, I remembered that I'd built one last year. Go ahead, try it. You'll find that every heavenly body has its own particular scent. Here, I'll point it at Jupiter.
",165,8,1,8,Fry,Fry1722,Fry," Smells like strawberries.
",27,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1723,Farnsworth," Exactly! And now Saturn.
",26,8,1,8,Fry,Fry1724,Fry," Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make me smell Uranus.
",87,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Leela1725,Leela," I don't get it.
",17,8,1,8,Fry,Farnsworth1726,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all.
",98,8,1,8,Leela,Fry1727,Fry," Oh. What's it called now?
",27,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1728,Farnsworth," Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you.
",42,8,1,8,Fry,Fry1729,Fry," No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here!  Hmm.  Hmm.
",69,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1730,Farnsworth," What is it?  Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul it's right off the Funk-o-Meter. I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe.
",174,8,1,8,Fry,Bender1731,Bender," Ooh! Ooh! Name it after me!
",29,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Leela1732,Leela," I think it's moving.
",22,8,1,8,Bender,Farnsworth1733,Farnsworth," Hmm. Perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory.  My God! Whatever it is, it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky crater. We have less than 72 hours.
",204,8,1,8,Leela,Bender1734,Bender," Well, let's get looting!
",26,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Fry1735,Fry," So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city?  What the heck is it?
",69,8,1,8,Bender,Farnsworth1736,Farnsworth," Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet.
",79,8,1,8,Fry,Narrator1737,Narrator,"  New York City: The year 2000. The most wasteful society in the history of the galaxy and it was running out of places to empty its never-ending output of garbage.  The landfills were full. New Jersey was full. And so, under cover of darkness, the city put its garbage out to sea on the world's largest barge.  The repulsive barge circled the oceans for 50 years but no country would accept it, not even that really filthy one. You know the one I mean. Finally, in 2052, the city used its mob connections to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage into outer space. Some experts claim the ball might return to Earth someday, but their concerns were dismissed as ""depressing"".
",676,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Fry1738,Fry," Wow! You got that off the Internet?  In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography.
",100,8,1,8,Narrator,Farnsworth1739,Farnsworth," Actually that's still true.
",29,8,1,8,Fry,Female Scientist1740,Female Scientist,"  Now that the garbage is in space, doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions.
",96,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Male Scientist1741,Male Scientist,"  With gusto!
",14,8,1,8,Female Scientist,Farnsworth1742,Farnsworth," So that's the situation. Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York, New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage.
",138,8,1,8,Male Scientist,Leela1743,Leela," Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you just throw your garbage away?
",100,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Fry1744,Fry," Hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?
",46,8,1,8,Leela,Leela1745,Leela," We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.
",60,8,1,8,Fry,Bender1746,Bender," Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.
",51,8,1,8,Leela,Leela1747,Leela," And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches.  Nothing just gets thrown away.
",102,8,1,8,Bender,Fry1748,Fry," The future is disgusting.
",27,8,1,8,Leela,Leela1749,Leela," Typical 20th century attitude.
",32,8,1,8,Fry,Fry1750,Fry," Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin.
",122,8,1,8,Leela,Leela1751,Leela," Those things are all from the 19th century.
",45,8,1,8,Fry,Fry1752,Fry," Yeah, well, they probably just copied us.
",43,8,1,8,Leela,Farnsworth1753,Farnsworth," Please! There's no time for this now. This is an emergency. We must warn the mayor.
",85,8,1,8,Fry,Poopenmeyer1754,Poopenmeyer," Garbage ball, huh? That sounds serious.
",41,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1755,Farnsworth," Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer.
",34,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer1756,Poopenmeyer," I gotta be sure this isn't another scientific fraud like global warming or second-hand smoke.  Send in my science advisor.
",124,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1757,Farnsworth," Wernstrom!
",12,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Wernstrom1758,Wernstrom," Well, well, well! Come to present your latest napkin, Professor?
",66,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1759,Farnsworth," No, I'm here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us. Smell for yourself.
",89,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Poopenmeyer1760,Poopenmeyer," Hey! Holy jeez!
",17,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Wernstrom1761,Wernstrom," That smell could be anything; a faulty stench coil, some cheese on the lens, who knows?
",89,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Woman #11762,Woman #1," Mr. Mayor, we just got this transmission from Neptune.
",56,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Man #11763,Man #1,"  Giant ... garbage ball ...  ... passed close by ... horrible stench.
",71,8,1,8,Woman #1,Woman #11764,Woman #1," The transmission cuts out there, sir.  No, I, guess it keeps going.
",69,8,1,8,Man #1,Woman #11765,Woman #1," There we go.
",14,8,1,8,Woman #1,Poopenmeyer1766,Poopenmeyer," My God! The senile old man is right.
",38,8,1,8,Woman #1,Wernstrom1767,Wernstrom," Do you mean him or me?
",24,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer1768,Poopenmeyer," Him!
",6,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Linda1769,Linda,"  Next, New New York in crisis. Morbo?
",39,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Morbo1770,Morbo,"  Thanks, human female. Puny Earthlings were shocked today to learn that a ball of garbage will destroy their pathetic city of New New York.
",141,8,1,8,Linda,Linda1771,Linda,"  Makes me glad we live here in Los Angeles.
",45,8,1,8,Morbo,Morbo1772,Morbo,"  Morbo agrees!
",16,8,1,8,Linda,Leela1773,Leela," Can't we just shoot a missile at it?
",38,8,1,8,Morbo,Military Man #11774,Military Man #1," We've simulated that on a supercomputer but the ball is just too damn gooey. A missile would go right through it.
",115,8,1,8,Leela,Farnsworth1775,Farnsworth," But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault line between this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy disks.
",163,8,1,8,Military Man #1,Military Man #11776,Military Man #1," In theory, it could work.
",27,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Wernstrom1777,Wernstrom," Uh, in theory, perhaps. But you'll never find a crew willing to take on a mission so suicidally dangerous.
",108,8,1,8,Military Man #1,Bender1778,Bender," Oh, crap!
",11,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Farnsworth1779,Farnsworth," Now, you'll only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet, killing billions.
",185,8,1,8,Bender,Bender1780,Bender,"  Oh, boo-hoo!
",15,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1781,Farnsworth," Now here's the bomb I've prepared. Once you activate it, you'll have 25 minutes to get away.
",94,8,1,8,Bender,Leela1782,Leela," That's all? But--
",19,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1783,Farnsworth," Now, now, there'll be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you return.
",89,8,1,8,Leela,Leela1784,Leela," Odour at magnitude 8.  Magnitude 12.  Magnitude 31.  We're breaking up. Turn on the anti-smell device.
",104,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Fry1785,Fry," Hmm, sporty!
",14,8,1,8,Leela,Fry1786,Fry," Wow!
",6,8,1,8,Fry,Leela1787,Leela," Look at all this filth.
",25,8,1,8,Fry,Fry1788,Fry," It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century.  Look! A real Beanie Baby.  Oh! A Mr. Spock collector's plate!  Some Bart Simpson dolls!
",172,8,1,8,Leela,Doll1789,Doll," Eat my shorts!
",16,8,1,8,Fry,Bender1790,Bender," OK   Mmm! Shorts!
",19,8,1,8,Doll,Leela1791,Leela," Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!
",72,8,1,8,Bender,Fry1792,Fry," This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.
",81,8,1,8,Leela,Fry1793,Fry,"  Alright, let's get to work.
",30,8,1,8,Fry,Leela1794,Leela," Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here.  Get ready to run. We've got 25 minutes.  Uh, 15 minutes.  5 minutes.  ""6h"" minutes?
",158,8,1,8,Fry,Bender1795,Bender," There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.
",69,8,1,8,Leela,Leela1796,Leela," That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds.
",70,8,1,8,Bender,Fry1797,Fry," We're gonna die!  Right?
",26,8,1,8,Leela,Bender1798,Bender," Right!
",8,8,1,8,Fry,Bender1799,Bender," It's gonna blow!
",18,8,1,8,Bender,Leela1800,Leela," Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!
",47,8,1,8,Bender,Bender1801,Bender," OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this.
",59,8,1,8,Leela,Fry1802,Fry," We're saved!
",14,8,1,8,Bender,Leela1803,Leela," Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable now. New New York is done for.
",74,8,1,8,Fry,Linda1804,Linda,"  All in all, this is one day Mittens the kitten won't soon forget!
",68,8,1,8,Leela,Morbo1805,Morbo,"  Kittens give Morbo gas. In lighter news, the city of New New York is doomed. Blame rests with known human Professor Hubert Farnsworth and his tiny, inferior brain.
",166,8,1,8,Linda,Farnsworth1806,Farnsworth," Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer on upside-down? I could swear I followed the manual precisely.  I'm a dried up husk of a scientist. This is all my fault.
",164,8,1,8,Morbo,Fry1807,Fry," No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can.  Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. Especially me.
",250,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Poopenmeyer1808,Poopenmeyer," Enough! You all failed miserably. It's time to put a real scientist in charge.
",80,8,1,8,Fry,Farnsworth1809,Farnsworth," Wernstrom!
",12,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Wernstrom1810,Wernstrom," The very same.
",16,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Poopenmeyer1811,Poopenmeyer," Dr. Wernstrom, can you save my city?
",38,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Wernstrom1812,Wernstrom," Of course. But it'll cost you. First I'll need tenure.
",56,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer1813,Poopenmeyer," Done.
",7,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Wernstrom1814,Wernstrom," And a big research grant.
",27,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer1815,Poopenmeyer," You got it.
",13,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Wernstrom1816,Wernstrom," Also, access to a lab and five graduate students, at least three of them Chinese.
",83,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer1817,Poopenmeyer," Um, alright done. What's your plan?
",37,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Wernstrom1818,Wernstrom," What plan? I'm set for life! Au revoir, suckers!
",50,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Leela1819,Leela," That rat! Do something!
",25,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Poopenmeyer1820,Poopenmeyer," I wish I could but he's got tenure!
",37,8,1,8,Leela,Poopenmeyer1821,Poopenmeyer," It's time to take action.  Stephanie, cancel the maid for today. Have her come tomorrow.  Well, I'm out of ideas. Anyone?
",123,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Farnsworth1822,Farnsworth," Wait! If we could build an object the exact size, density and consistency of the garbage ball, it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to bits.
",159,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Leela1823,Leela," But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage?
",81,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1824,Farnsworth," Alas, I don't know.
",21,8,1,8,Leela,Fry1825,Fry," Uh, what about garbage?
",25,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth1826,Farnsworth," Good Lord! A second ball of garbage! That just might work!
",60,8,1,8,Fry,Poopenmeyer1827,Poopenmeyer," But garbage isn't something you just find lying in the streets of Manhattan. This city's been garbage-free for 500 years!
",123,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Fry1828,Fry," Then it's time to make some more.
",35,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer1829,Poopenmeyer," Make garbage? But how?
",24,8,1,8,Fry,Fry1830,Fry," Stand back and watch the master! This Slurm can.  Now it's garbage. These papers.  Garbage. This picture of your wife.  Pure garbage. Now you try it.
",151,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer1831,Poopenmeyer," By God, I think the boy's got something. Come on, everyone! The fate of the city is at stake!
",95,8,1,8,Fry,Fry1832,Fry," Good!  Don't finish that cruller, throw it away  Bender. Drink that beer and drop the bottle on the ground.  Very nice.
",121,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer1833,Poopenmeyer," Get that robot some more beer!  We've trashed this room but that's just the start. We've got to get Fry's message to the people.
",130,8,1,8,Fry,Fry1834,Fry,"  People of New New York, take a lesson from the 20th century. Stop all this pain-in-the-ass recycling and throw your garbage on the floor.
",140,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Fry1835,Fry,"  Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place like I used to. Your city is counting on you.
",86,8,1,8,Fry,Farnsworth1836,Farnsworth," If my calculations are correct, this garbage ball will knock the other garbage ball directly into the sun.
",108,8,1,8,Fry,Wernstrom1837,Wernstrom," And if my calculations are correct, we're all going to die horribly.
",70,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Poopenmeyer1838,Poopenmeyer," Alright, places everyone. Prepare for launch.
",47,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Farnsworth1839,Farnsworth," Five, four, three, two, three, four, five, six...
",51,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Leela1840,Leela,"  Just fire the damn thing.
",28,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Fry1841,Fry," Oops!
",7,8,1,8,Leela,Farnsworth1842,Farnsworth," Burning garbage!
",18,8,1,8,Fry,Fry1843,Fry," It worked!
",12,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Poopenmeyer1844,Poopenmeyer," And so, on behalf of the entire city, I thank you, Professor Farnsworth. I now present you with the Academy prize, which we confiscated from Dr. Wernstrom after it became apparent that he was a jackass.
",204,8,1,8,Fry,Farnsworth1845,Farnsworth," Yes! In your face, Wernstrom!
",31,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Wernstrom1846,Wernstrom," I'll get you, Farnsworth. Even if it takes me another hundred years.
",70,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Poopenmeyer1847,Poopenmeyer," And, Fry, we owe you a tremendous debt as well. If not for your 20th century garbage-making skills, we'd all be buried under 20th century garbage.
",148,8,1,8,Wernstrom,Leela1848,Leela," Should we really be celebrating? I mean, what if the second garbage ball returns to Earth like the first one did?
",115,8,1,8,Poopenmeyer,Fry1849,Fry," Who cares? That won't be for hundreds of years.
",49,8,1,8,Leela,Farnsworth1850,Farnsworth," Exactly! It's none of our concern.
",36,8,1,8,Fry,Fry1851,Fry," That's the 20th century spirit!
",33,8,1,8,Farnsworth,Fry1852,Fry," This is awesome! I've been waiting a thousand years to see a Beastie Boys show.
",81,9,1,9,Fry,Bender1853,Bender," Can I get anybody a beer?
",27,9,1,9,Fry,Fry1854,Fry," Sure!
",7,9,1,9,Bender,Announcer #11855,Announcer #1,"  Ladies and gentlemen, here to lay down some old, old, incredibly old school beats: The Beastie Boys!
",103,9,1,9,Fry,Beastie Boys1856,Beastie Boys,"  Well now don't you tell to smile,
You stick around,,
I'll make it worth your while
Got numbers beyond what you can dial,
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile,
Style profile I said,
It always brings me back when I hear Wu Child...
",231,9,1,9,Announcer #1,Leela1857,Leela," Impressive. They're busting mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.
",66,9,1,9,Beastie Boys,Bender1858,Bender," I believe that qualifies as ill. At least from a technical standpoint.
",72,9,1,9,Leela,Fry1859,Fry," Will you guys shut up! I'm trying to look cool.
",49,9,1,9,Bender,Beastie Boys1860,Beastie Boys,"  ...known for the Flintstone Flop
Tammy D gettin' biz on the crop,
Beastie Boys know to let the beat...
",105,9,1,9,Fry,Mike1861,Mike," Drop!  Ow! How's it going?  Enjoying the show? Ow!   Don't forget to pick up a T-shirt!
",89,9,1,9,Beastie Boys,Fry1862,Fry," Wow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come on, guys. Tonight we're gonna party like its 1999 ... again.
",99,9,1,9,Mike,Beastie Boys1863,Beastie Boys,"  Well it's 50 cups of coffee and you know it's on
I move the crowd to the break of break of dawn...
",101,9,1,9,Fry,Leela1864,Leela," Ow! Hey, watch it!
",20,9,1,9,Beastie Boys,Fry1865,Fry," Man, these guys rock harder than ever!
",40,9,1,9,Leela,Mike1866,Mike,"  Oh, my...
",12,9,1,9,Fry,MCA1867,MCA,"  It's a mirage...
",19,9,1,9,Mike,Ad-Rock1868,Ad-Rock,"  Tellin' you all it's a...
",28,9,1,9,MCA,Beastie Boys1869,Beastie Boys,"  Sabotage!
",12,9,1,9,Ad-Rock,Ad-Rock1870,Ad-Rock,"  Sabotage, yeah!
",18,9,1,9,Beastie Boys,Mike1871,Mike," Peace, we out!
",16,9,1,9,Ad-Rock,Fender1872,Fender," Hey, Bender!
",14,9,1,9,Mike,Bender1873,Bender," Hey, Fender! Man, I haven't seen you since high school. You still workin' at Jack In The Box?
",95,9,1,9,Fender,Fender1874,Fender," Not anymore, baby. I'm with the band!
",39,9,1,9,Bender,Mike1875,Mike," Aw! Oh, yeah!
",15,9,1,9,Fender,Fender1876,Fender," Hey, fellas, hey. I want you to meet my friends, Bender, Fry and Leela.
",73,9,1,9,Mike,Ad-Rock1877,Ad-Rock," Y'know, we're really not that interested in meeting them.
",59,9,1,9,Fender,Fry1878,Fry," Wow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th century, I had all five of your albums.
",80,9,1,9,Ad-Rock,Ad-Rock1879,Ad-Rock," That was a thousand years ago. Now we got seven.
",50,9,1,9,Fry,Fry1880,Fry," Cool! Can I borrow the new ones? And a couple of blank tapes?
",63,9,1,9,Ad-Rock,Fender1881,Fender,"  Hey, Bender, why don't we ditch these organ sacks and hit the real party?
",76,9,1,9,Fry,Bender1882,Bender," Count me in! I'm gonna drink till I reboot!
",45,9,1,9,Fender,Bender1883,Bender," Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
",70,9,1,9,Bender,Fender1884,Fender," Don't be a drag, man. We're jacking on!  Aw, yeah!  Wanna jolt?
",65,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1885,Bender," Uh, hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations manual?
",82,9,1,9,Fender,Robot #11886,Robot #1," Counter indicated!
",20,9,1,9,Bender,Fender1887,Fender," Come on, Bender, grab a jack. I told these guys you were cool.
",64,9,1,9,Robot #1,Bender1888,Bender," Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!
",67,9,1,9,Fender,Fender1889,Fender," Easy, baby. You don't wanna get hooked on this stuff.
",55,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1890,Bender," Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality.
",62,9,1,9,Fender,Fry1891,Fry," Hey, uh, Bender? What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?
",63,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1892,Bender," Shut up, square!  I'll just be a minute!
",42,9,1,9,Fry,Preacherbot1893,Preacherbot," Wretched sinner unit! The path to robot heaven lies here ...  ... in The Good Book 3.0.
",89,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1894,Bender," Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat it!
",81,9,1,9,Preacherbot,Fry1895,Fry," Who was that guy?
",19,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1896,Bender," Your mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!
",45,9,1,9,Fry,Hermes1897,Hermes," Our electric bill's climbing faster than a green snake up a sugar cane. Obviously someone round been wastin' a whole heap a juice! Probably you!
",146,9,1,9,Bender,Zoidberg1898,Zoidberg," Me?
",5,9,1,9,Hermes,Amy1899,Amy," Good morning, Bender.
",23,9,1,9,Zoidberg,Bender1900,Bender," None of your business! Get off my back!
",41,9,1,9,Amy,Amy1901,Amy," What's his problem?
",21,9,1,9,Bender,Leela1902,Leela," If I didn't know better I'd almost think he was abusing electricity.
",70,9,1,9,Amy,Fry1903,Fry," Bender? No way!  I definitely would've noticed something.
",59,9,1,9,Leela,Leela1904,Leela," Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?
",89,9,1,9,Fry,Bender1905,Bender,"  No! Don't come in!
",21,9,1,9,Leela,Farnsworth1906,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet!
",99,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1907,Bender," Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second.
",54,9,1,9,Farnsworth,Fry1908,Fry," I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still think he was gay.
",89,9,1,9,Bender,Leela1909,Leela," Did he use his tongue?
",24,9,1,9,Fry,Fry1910,Fry," A little.  You OK, Bender?
",28,9,1,9,Leela,Bender1911,Bender," None of your business! Get off my back!
",41,9,1,9,Fry,Leela1912,Leela," Uh-oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula.
",86,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1913,Bender," A what kind of disturbance?
",29,9,1,9,Leela,Leela1914,Leela," Electrical. Anyway, it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid it.
",75,9,1,9,Bender,Leela1915,Leela," We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!
",71,9,1,9,Leela,Fry1916,Fry," What's happening? I-I feel weird!
",35,9,1,9,Leela,Bender1917,Bender," Come on, universe, you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got!  Oh, mama!
",89,9,1,9,Fry,Bender1918,Bender," What?
",7,9,1,9,Bender,Leela1919,Leela," Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring.
",86,9,1,9,Bender,Zoidberg1920,Zoidberg," In fact, that's why we loved you.
",35,9,1,9,Leela,Leela1921,Leela," But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.
",68,9,1,9,Zoidberg,Fry1922,Fry," And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.
",233,9,1,9,Leela,Bender1923,Bender," You're right. I'm a lost cause.
",33,9,1,9,Fry,Bender1924,Bender," Maybe there's another way.
",28,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1925,Bender," Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff.   What am I doing? What have I become? Huh?
",78,9,1,9,Bender,Preacherbot1926,Preacherbot," I see a lot of fancy robots here today, made of real shiny metal. But that don't impress the Robot Devil, no, sir!
",116,9,1,9,Bender,Vergerbot1927,Vergerbot," No, sir!
",10,9,1,9,Preacherbot,Preacherbot1928,Preacherbot," 'Cause if you're a sinner, he's gonna plug his infernal modem in the wall, belchin' smoke and flame. And he's gonna download you straight to Robot Hell!
",154,9,1,9,Vergerbot,Vergerbot1929,Vergerbot," Straight to hell!
",19,9,1,9,Preacherbot,Preacherbot1930,Preacherbot," So I ask you: Who will stand up and be saved? Who? Who?
",57,9,1,9,Vergerbot,Bender1931,Bender,"  Me.
",6,9,1,9,Preacherbot,Hermes1932,Hermes," And as a further cost-cutting measure, I have eliminated the salt-water cooler.
",81,9,1,9,Bender,Zoidberg1933,Zoidberg," This is a witch hunt!
",23,9,1,9,Hermes,Bender1934,Bender,"  Oh, what a beautiful morning,
Oh what a beautiful day!
 Greetings, friends. Don't we all look nice today?
",108,9,1,9,Zoidberg,Fry1935,Fry," Great! He's whacked out on electricity again.
",47,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1936,Bender," No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion.
",60,9,1,9,Fry,Fry1937,Fry," Religion? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?
",55,9,1,9,Bender,Leela1938,Leela," Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should be supportive.
",100,9,1,9,Fry,Farnsworth1939,Farnsworth,"  Yes.
",7,9,1,9,Leela,Amy1940,Amy,"  Oh, yeah.
",12,9,1,9,Farnsworth,Hermes1941,Hermes,"  Oh, yes!
",11,9,1,9,Amy,Zoidberg1942,Zoidberg,"  Oh, yeah.
",12,9,1,9,Hermes,Bender1943,Bender," Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned baptism ceremony!
",94,9,1,9,Zoidberg,Preacherbot1944,Preacherbot," We are gathered here today to deliver brother Bender from the cold, steel grip of the Robot Devil unto the cold, steel bosom of our congregation.
",147,9,1,9,Bender,Robot #1 #21945,Robot #1 #2," Tell it, Preacher!
",20,9,1,9,Preacherbot,Robot #1 #31946,Robot #1 #3," That equals true.
",19,9,1,9,Robot #1 #2,Preacherbot1947,Preacherbot," Brother Bender, do you accept the principles of Robotology on pain of eternal damnation in Robot Hell?
",104,9,1,9,Robot #1 #3,Bender1948,Bender," Yes, I do.
",12,9,1,9,Preacherbot,Preacherbot1949,Preacherbot," Then I will now baptise you.  Press any key to continue.
",58,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1950,Bender," Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?
",55,9,1,9,Preacherbot,Leela1951,Leela," This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to dinner.
",79,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1952,Bender," The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.
",54,9,1,9,Leela,Waiter1953,Waiter," Would monsieur care to see the wine list?
",43,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1954,Bender," No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil.  Ah! Functional!
",82,9,1,9,Waiter,Hermes1955,Hermes," Mon, I'm hungrier than a green snake in a sugar cane field!
",61,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1956,Bender," Friends! Friends! Surely you're not going to eat before we say Robot Grace?  In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerematic: 1000101010101...
",234,9,1,9,Hermes,Bender1957,Bender," ...0010110012. Amen.
",22,9,1,9,Bender,Fry1958,Fry," Does that mean we can eat now?
",32,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1959,Bender," Yes.  But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come here, Fry!
",96,9,1,9,Fry,Fry1960,Fry," Oh, uh, but I don't want to.
",30,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1961,Bender," Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend!  Come on, everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear down some emotional walls.
",110,9,1,9,Fry,Leela1962,Leela," What are you doing to my ship?
",32,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1963,Bender," Sanctifying it!  There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.
",65,9,1,9,Leela,Fry1964,Fry," Bender's stupid religion is driving me nuts.
",46,9,1,9,Bender,Leela1965,Leela," Amen.
",7,9,1,9,Fry,Farnsworth1966,Farnsworth," If only he had joined a mainstream religion like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.
",71,9,1,9,Leela,Fry1967,Fry," We've got to get the old Bender back.
",39,9,1,9,Farnsworth,Leela1968,Leela," And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a little thing called ""sleaze"".
",99,9,1,9,Fry,Bender1969,Bender," I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?
",128,9,1,9,Leela,Fry1970,Fry," Uh, this.
",11,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1971,Bender," Where are we delivering it to?
",32,9,1,9,Fry,Leela1972,Leela," Uh, here.
",11,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1973,Bender," Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening of fasting and repentance.
",99,9,1,9,Leela,Fry1974,Fry," Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some exotic dancing?
",97,9,1,9,Bender,Leela1975,Leela," Hey, great idea!
",18,9,1,9,Fry,Bender1976,Bender," But ... those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits.
",72,9,1,9,Leela,Fry1977,Fry," Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified wine.
",75,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1978,Bender," What? Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified.
",68,9,1,9,Fry,Leela1979,Leela," Hey, Bender, look at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti strand.
",78,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1980,Bender," Thou shalt not snatch.
",24,9,1,9,Leela,Fry1981,Fry," And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!
",62,9,1,9,Bender,Hookerbot1982,Hookerbot," Hey, sailing unit!
",20,9,1,9,Fry,Bender1983,Bender," Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.
",59,9,1,9,Hookerbot,Fry1984,Fry," Pfft! That's for losers. C'mon, sin your heart out.
",53,9,1,9,Bender,Leela1985,Leela," Go nuts.
",10,9,1,9,Fry,Hookerbot1986,Hookerbot," Live a little.
",16,9,1,9,Leela,Woman #11987,Woman #1," Could you hold my purse for a minute?
",39,9,1,9,Hookerbot,Fry1988,Fry," Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!
",40,9,1,9,Woman #1,Bender1989,Bender," Well...
",9,9,1,9,Fry,Bender1990,Bender," I'm the greatest.  Woo-hoo!
",29,9,1,9,Bender,Fry1991,Fry," Look's like we got the old Bender back!
",41,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1992,Bender," You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing.
",46,9,1,9,Fry,Bender1993,Bender," Y'know, as a major Hollywood director, I'll be holding auditions tonight for my next movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might just have what it takes.  Hey! I'm trying to score here! Can't you read the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign?  No! No!
",263,9,1,9,Bender,Robot #1 Devil1994,Robot #1 Devil," Greetings, Bender! Welcome to Robot Hell.
",43,9,1,9,Bender,Leela1995,Leela," What in hell happened to Bender?
",34,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Fry1996,Fry," Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's still here.  Look, Nibbler's caught the scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, boy. Follow that stench.
",140,9,1,9,Leela,Bender1997,Bender," I'm hallucinating this, right?
",32,9,1,9,Fry,Robot #1 Devil1998,Robot #1 Devil," No, Bender. Robot Hell is quite real. Here's our brochure.
",60,9,1,9,Bender,Bender1999,Bender," But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.
",74,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil2000,Robot #1 Devil," Sorry, Bender, you agreed to this when you joined our religion. If you sin you go to Robot Hell, for all eternity.
",116,9,1,9,Bender,Bender2001,Bender," Aw, hell-- I mean ""heck""!
",27,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil2002,Robot #1 Devil," It's alright, you can say that here.
",38,9,1,9,Bender,Fry2003,Fry," Wait! I remember this place. They shut it down after all those people caught salmonella from the flume ride.
",110,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Leela2004,Leela," Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's old religion.
",54,9,1,9,Fry,Fry2005,Fry," Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual Robot Hell.
",51,9,1,9,Leela,Leela2006,Leela," Who would've thought hell would really exist? And that it would be in New Jersey!
",83,9,1,9,Fry,Fry2007,Fry," Actually--
",12,9,1,9,Leela,Robot #1 Devil2008,Robot #1 Devil," We know all your sins, Bender. And for each one we've prepared an agonising and ironic punishment. Gentlemen?
",111,9,1,9,Fry,Bender2009,Bender," Aw, crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?
",37,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil2010,Robot #1 Devil,"  Cigars are evil,
You won't miss 'em,
We'll find ways to simulate that smell,
What a sorry fella,
Rolled up and smoked like a panatela,
Here on level one of Robot Hell!
",170,9,1,9,Bender,Robot #1 Devil2011,Robot #1 Devil,"  Gambling's wrong and so is cheating,
So is forging phoney IOU's,
Let's let Lady Luck decide,
What type of torture's justified,
I'm pit boss here on level two!
",161,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil2012,Robot #1 Devil,"  Ooh! Deep-fried robot!
",25,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Bender2013,Bender,"  Just tell me why.
",20,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil2014,Robot #1 Devil,"  Please read this 55-page warrant.
",36,9,1,9,Bender,Bender2015,Bender,"  There must be robots worse than I.
",37,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil2016,Robot #1 Devil,"  We've checked around, there really aren't.
",45,9,1,9,Bender,Bender2017,Bender,"  Then please let me explain,
My crimes were merely boy-ish pranks.
",68,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil2018,Robot #1 Devil,"  You stole from boy scouts, nuns and banks!
",45,9,1,9,Bender,Bender2019,Bender,"  Ah, don't blame me,
Blame my upbringing!
",43,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil2020,Robot #1 Devil,"  Please stop sinning while I'm singing!
",41,9,1,9,Bender,Robot #1 Devil2021,Robot #1 Devil,"  Selling bootleg tapes is wrong,
Musicians need that income to survive.
",73,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Beastie Boys2022,Beastie Boys,"  Hey, Bender, gonna make some noise,
With your hard drive scratched by the Beastie Boys!
That's whatcha, whatcha, whatcha get on level five!
",142,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Fry2023,Fry,"  I don't feel well.
",21,9,1,9,Beastie Boys,Leela2024,Leela,"  It's up to us to rescue him.
",31,9,1,9,Fry,Fry2025,Fry,"  Maybe he likes it here in Hell.
",34,9,1,9,Leela,Leela2026,Leela,"  It's us who tempted him to sin.
",34,9,1,9,Fry,Fry2027,Fry,"  Maybe he's back at the motel.
",32,9,1,9,Leela,Leela2028,Leela,"  Come on, Fry, don't be scared,
I'm sure at least one of us will be spared,
So just sit back, enjoy the ride.
",111,9,1,9,Fry,Fry2029,Fry,"  My ass has blisters from the slide.
",38,9,1,9,Leela,Robot #1 Devil2030,Robot #1 Devil,"  Fencing diamonds,
Fixing cockfights,
Publishing indecent magazines,
",70,9,1,9,Fry,Robot #1 Devil2031,Robot #1 Devil," You'll pay for every crime,
Knee-deep in electric slime,
You'll suffer till the end of time,
Enduring torture's, most of which rhyme,
Trapped forever here in Robot Hell!
",171,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil2032,Robot #1 Devil,"  Of course, that's just for starters.
",39,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Fry2033,Fry," Bender, are you alright?
",26,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Bender2034,Bender," No! Oh, they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing.
",66,9,1,9,Fry,Leela2035,Leela," Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take to get our friend back?
",61,9,1,9,Bender,Robot #1 Devil2036,Robot #1 Devil," Sorry, but I hold all the cards here. There's nothing I can do. Now, if you'll just sign this fiddle contest waiver.
",118,9,1,9,Leela,Leela2037,Leela," Wait. What fiddle contest?
",28,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil2038,Robot #1 Devil," The Fairness In Hell Act of 2275 requires me to inform you that if you can best me in a fiddle contest, you win back Bender's soul. As well as a solid gold fiddle.
",165,9,1,9,Leela,Fry2039,Fry," Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?
",73,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil2040,Robot #1 Devil," Well it's mostly for show.
",28,9,1,9,Fry,Leela2041,Leela,"  Do you know how to play the fiddle?
",38,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Fry2042,Fry,"  No. Do you?
",14,9,1,9,Leela,Leela2043,Leela,"  No, but I used to play the drums. They're sorta similar.  What happens if we lose?
",85,9,1,9,Fry,Robot #1 Devil2044,Robot #1 Devil," You'll only win a smaller, silver fiddle. Also I guess I'll kill one of you, uh, him.
",87,9,1,9,Leela,Leela2045,Leela," We'll do it.
",14,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil2046,Robot #1 Devil," Very well, then. Beat this.
",29,9,1,9,Leela,Bender2047,Bender," Well, we're boned.
",20,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil2048,Robot #1 Devil," Your turn.  Ha!
",17,9,1,9,Bender,Leela2049,Leela," Time for the drum solo!
",25,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Fry2050,Fry," Run!
",6,9,1,9,Leela,Robot #1 Devil2051,Robot #1 Devil," Stop them! They cheated!
",26,9,1,9,Fry,Leela2052,Leela," Hurry, Bender!
",16,9,1,9,Robot #1 Devil,Bender2053,Bender," I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!
",47,9,1,9,Leela,Leela2054,Leela," Oh, sorry.
",12,9,1,9,Bender,Bender2055,Bender," Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me.
",92,9,1,9,Leela,Leela2056,Leela," Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that.
",64,9,1,9,Bender,Bender2057,Bender," I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?
",60,9,1,9,Leela,Fry2058,Fry," Good old Bender!
",18,9,1,9,Bender,Beastie Boys2059,Beastie Boys," Yeah, yeah! This one goes out to my man, Bender,
Sending this one out, special dedication,
To all my peoples in the robot homeworld,
Yeah, yeah! Big up with the Professor,
My man, Dr. Zoidberg,
I'd like to shout out-- a personal shout out to Leela,
Fry! My man, Bender,
Nibber, Nibbler, in the house,
Big shout out to all Futurama!
",333,9,1,9,Fry,Leela2060,Leela," That was the worst delivery ever.
",35,10,1,10,Beastie Boys,Fry2061,Fry," Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called ""Cannibalon""!
",62,10,1,10,Leela,Bender2062,Bender," Me neither.  Food was good, though.
",37,10,1,10,Fry,Farnsworth2063,Farnsworth," Oh, great news, everyone.
",27,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2064,Bender," Shove it! We quit!
",20,10,1,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2065,Farnsworth," In that case I'll have to hire a new crew to go on our company vacation.
",74,10,1,10,Bender,Leela2066,Leela," Vacation?
",11,10,1,10,Farnsworth,Bender2067,Bender," Alright!
",10,10,1,10,Leela,Fry2068,Fry," This is great! I haven't had time off since I was 21 through 24.
",66,10,1,10,Bender,Farnsworth2069,Farnsworth," It's just my way of thanking you for not reporting my countless violations of safety and minimum wage laws.
",109,10,1,10,Fry,Bender2070,Bender," Aww, you!
",11,10,1,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2071,Farnsworth," I've booked us all on the maiden voyage of the largest, most luxurious space cruise ship ever built.  The Titanic!
",116,10,1,10,Bender,Leela2072,Leela," Looks nice.
",13,10,1,10,Farnsworth,Fry2073,Fry," Hey, uh, where's my suitcase?  Ow!
",36,10,1,10,Leela,Poopenmeyer2074,Poopenmeyer," As Mayor of New New York, it's my pleasure to introduce the honorary captain for the Titanic's maiden voyage. A man who single-handedly defeated the Retiree People of the Assisted Living Nebula: Zapp Brannigan!
",212,10,1,10,Fry,Leela2075,Leela," Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!
",30,10,1,10,Poopenmeyer,Zoidberg2076,Zoidberg," You know Zapp Brannigan?
",26,10,1,10,Leela,Leela2077,Leela," Let's just say we've ""crossed paths"".
",39,10,1,10,Zoidberg,Bender2078,Bender," Was that before or after you slept with him?
",46,10,1,10,Leela,Zapp2079,Zapp," She's a beautiful ship, alright. Shapely ... seductive. I'm gonna fly her brains out.  And now, without further adieu, I christen this ship, Titanic.
",151,10,1,10,Bender,Zapp2080,Zapp," Well, well, well! The Lady Leela. Take notes, Kif. You're about to witness the subtle waltz known as seduction.  So, trapped on a ship with me. What say you and I knock some very sensual boots?
",195,10,1,10,Zapp,Leela2081,Leela," It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fiancÃ© now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh ...  Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan.
",122,10,1,10,Zapp,Fry2082,Fry," Huh?  Ooh! How do you do?
",27,10,1,10,Leela,Farnsworth2083,Farnsworth," Ah, here's my stateroom.
",26,10,1,10,Fry,Bender2084,Bender," Come on, where is it?
",23,10,1,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2085,Farnsworth," Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife, LaBarbara, have the suite through there. And Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is on the other side.
",138,10,1,10,Bender,Fry2086,Fry," Man, first class seems nice!
",30,10,1,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2087,Farnsworth," It'll seem even nicer once you've seen your room.
",51,10,1,10,Fry,Amy2088,Amy," Looks like we're on the Fiesta Deck.
",38,10,1,10,Farnsworth,Leela2089,Leela," This is it.
",13,10,1,10,Amy,Fry2090,Fry," Well at least we get a window!
",32,10,1,10,Leela,Bender2091,Bender," Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!
",128,10,1,10,Fry,Amy2092,Amy," I think I'll go and fill up on bisque at the buffet.
",54,10,1,10,Bender,Fry2093,Fry," I guess that just leaves you and your fake fiancÂ´ ... all alone ... on a romantic cruise.
",91,10,1,10,Amy,Leela2094,Leela," Take it off or I'll break it off.
",35,10,1,10,Fry,Fry2095,Fry," OK!
",5,10,1,10,Leela,Zapp2096,Zapp," Captain's inspection!
",23,10,1,10,Fry,Bender2097,Bender," Hmm.  I'm bettin' it all!  Come on, baby needs a new pair of feet!
",68,10,1,10,Zapp,Croupier2098,Croupier," Snake eyes.
",13,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2099,Bender," No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! You gotta give me a do-over!
",66,10,1,10,Croupier,Croupier2100,Croupier," Sorry, the house limit is three do-overs. Next shooter.
",57,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2101,Bender," Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest drink.
",51,10,1,10,Croupier,iZac2102,iZac," You got it!
",13,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2103,Bender," Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.
",43,10,1,10,iZac,Countess2104,Countess," Charmed. I'm the Countess de la Roca. I was surprised to see another robot staying in first class. Most of the robots I meet are labourers.
",141,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2105,Bender," I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word ""labour"".
",63,10,1,10,Countess,Countess2106,Countess," Oh, Mr. Bender!
",17,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2107,Bender," Please, call me Bender.
",25,10,1,10,Countess,Countess2108,Countess,"  Oh, goodness. I don't--
",26,10,1,10,Bender,Zapp2109,Zapp," Kif, I'm feeling the captain's itch.
",38,10,1,10,Countess,Kif2110,Kif," I'll get the powder, sir.
",27,10,1,10,Zapp,Zapp2111,Zapp," No, the itch for adventure! Prepare to change course.
",55,10,1,10,Kif,Kif2112,Kif," Sir, this is a leisure cruise. Our path was set by the travel agency.
",71,10,1,10,Zapp,Zapp2113,Zapp," That's for schoolgirls! Now here's a route with some chest hair.
",66,10,1,10,Kif,Kif2114,Kif," But that course leads directly through a swarm of comets.
",59,10,1,10,Zapp,Zapp2115,Zapp," Yes, comets! The icebergs of the sky. By jack-knifing from one to the next at breakneck speed we might just get some kind of gravity boost ... or something.  It's time to shove a jalapeÃ±o up this ships tailpipe.  Divert power from the shields, full speed ahead!
",263,10,1,10,Kif,Amy2116,Amy," Oh, yeah!
",11,10,1,10,Zapp,Mrs. Wong2117,Mrs. Wong," Amy! Hello!
",13,10,1,10,Amy,Amy2118,Amy," Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?
",36,10,1,10,Mrs. Wong,Leo2119,Leo," We were planning on enjoying a relaxing vacation. But since you're here, we'll have to do some meddling.
",106,10,1,10,Amy,Mrs. Wong2120,Mrs. Wong," We met the nicest boy in the cabin next to ours.
",50,10,1,10,Leo,Leo2121,Leo," He's not very ugly.
",21,10,1,10,Mrs. Wong,Mrs. Wong2122,Mrs. Wong," You should marry him! Or at least use him to conceive a grandchild for us.
",76,10,1,10,Leo,Leo2123,Leo," There he is at the buffet!
",28,10,1,10,Mrs. Wong,Amy2124,Amy," Uh, he seems really nice but, well, I already have a boyfriend.
",65,10,1,10,Leo,Mrs. Wong2125,Mrs. Wong," Really? Where is he?
",22,10,1,10,Amy,Leo2126,Leo," And why isn't he here right now fathering our grandchild?
",59,10,1,10,Mrs. Wong,Amy2127,Amy," Uh...
",7,10,1,10,Leo,Leela2128,Leela," Well, our accommodations aren't great, but it sure is beautiful out here.
",75,10,1,10,Amy,Fry2129,Fry," Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic view!
",86,10,1,10,Leela,Leela2130,Leela," Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to think this whole fake fiancÃ© thing was a terrible, terrible--
",100,10,1,10,Fry,Fry2131,Fry," Hmm? Mmm!
",11,10,1,10,Leela,Zapp2132,Zapp," Leela, perhaps this is an awkward time but if things don't work out with this pipsqueak here ...  ... I just want you to know I'll be there to score you on the rebound.
",170,10,1,10,Fry,Leela2133,Leela," Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp.
",62,10,1,10,Zapp,Fry2134,Fry," Well, you got anything else for him?
",38,10,1,10,Leela,Leela2135,Leela," Alright, can we try not to complicate this?
",45,10,1,10,Fry,Amy2136,Amy," Mom, Dad, I'd like you to meet Fry, my boyfriend.
",51,10,1,10,Leela,Fry2137,Fry," Hmm? Mmm!
",11,10,1,10,Amy,Fry2138,Fry," See you later, wuvvums!
",25,10,1,10,Fry,Leela2139,Leela," It would have been nice if you'd told me you were going out with Amy.
",71,10,1,10,Fry,Fry2140,Fry," I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're not jealous, are you?
",94,10,1,10,Leela,Leela2141,Leela," What? No. No! Of course not!
",30,10,1,10,Fry,Fry2142,Fry," Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful.
",78,10,1,10,Leela,Countess2143,Countess," Mind if I freshen up a bit before we go out?
",46,10,1,10,Fry,Bender2144,Bender," I was just about to suggest the same thing.  Pay dirt!
",56,10,1,10,Countess,Countess2145,Countess," Lovely, isn't it?
",19,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2146,Bender," Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.
",38,10,1,10,Countess,Countess2147,Countess," Oh, Bender! Either that was a computing error or you're the most romantic robot I've ever met!
",96,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2148,Bender," I don't get it, iZac; that bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon's brain. Why couldn't I steal it?
",106,10,1,10,Countess,iZac2149,iZac," It's obvious, Mr. B. You're in love.
",38,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2150,Bender," Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess, built with a silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe.
",139,10,1,10,iZac,iZac2151,iZac," Hey, you gonna pay for those?
",31,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2152,Bender," Hell, no!
",11,10,1,10,iZac,iZac2153,iZac," Security to bar area. Security to bar area.
",45,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2154,Bender," Fellas, please. I'm in love!
",30,10,1,10,iZac,iZac2155,iZac," Rough him up!
",15,10,1,10,Bender,Countess2156,Countess," What are you doing?
",21,10,1,10,iZac,iZac2157,iZac," This penniless chump was stealing drinks, ma'am.
",50,10,1,10,Countess,Countess2158,Countess," I see. Here you are, sir.  Keep the change.
",45,10,1,10,iZac,iZac2159,iZac," You got it!
",13,10,1,10,Countess,Zoidberg2160,Zoidberg," Aha!
",6,10,1,10,iZac,Fry2161,Fry," Go, Professor!
",16,10,1,10,Zoidberg,Amy2162,Amy," Lean back more!
",17,10,1,10,Fry,Farnsworth2163,Farnsworth," Ow!
",5,10,1,10,Amy,Labarbara2164,Labarbara," Come on, Hermes, you could out-limbo all of these people!
",59,10,1,10,Farnsworth,Hermes2165,Hermes," Don't be a dog heart, woman. You know I can't. Not after what happened.
",73,10,1,10,Labarbara,Announcer #12166,Announcer #1,"  Now limbo-ing for the Earth team, Hermes Conrad.
",51,10,1,10,Hermes,Boy2167,Boy,"  You're my hero, Hermes! I'm gonna be just like you!
",54,10,1,10,Announcer #1,Hermes2168,Hermes," No, boy, stop! It's too low! Your backbone can't take it!
",59,10,1,10,Boy,Boy2169,Boy," I'm just like Hermes! I'm just like--
",39,10,1,10,Hermes,Hermes2170,Hermes,"  Nooo!
",8,10,1,10,Boy,Labarbara2171,Labarbara," There, there. Now you don't have to limbo if you don't want. It doesn't make you any less of a man.
",101,10,1,10,Hermes,Farnsworth2172,Farnsworth," Though it did get me some action!
",35,10,1,10,Labarbara,Hattie McDoogal2173,Hattie McDoogal," I like a man who's flexible!
",30,10,1,10,Farnsworth,Zapp2174,Zapp," Your attention, please. As captain of this vessel, the terrible burden of naming a limbo contest winner is mine and mine alone.
",129,10,1,10,Hattie McDoogal,Kif2175,Kif," Shouldn't you be steering between the comets?
",47,10,1,10,Zapp,Zapp2176,Zapp," And the winner is, Leela!
",27,10,1,10,Kif,Leela2177,Leela," But I didn't even limbo.
",26,10,1,10,Zapp,Zapp2178,Zapp," No matter. I know from personal experience how horizontal you can get. As your reward, you and that hairpile are invited to dine at the captain's table this evening.
",167,10,1,10,Leela,Bender2179,Bender," Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie, it's magnetic.
",130,10,1,10,Zapp,Countess2180,Countess," Bender, I don't care whether you have money. I love you for your artificial intelligence and your sincerity simulator.
",120,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2181,Bender," You do? Really?
",17,10,1,10,Countess,Zapp2182,Zapp," I like your style, Fry. You remind me of a young me. Not much younger, mind you. Perhaps even a couple of years older.
",120,10,1,10,Bender,Fry2183,Fry," Thank you, sir.
",17,10,1,10,Zapp,Zapp2184,Zapp," As a gentleman, I must warn you. If you so much as glance at another woman, I'll be all over Leela like a fly on a pile of very seductive manure.
",147,10,1,10,Fry,Fry2185,Fry," Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me.
",51,10,1,10,Zapp,Amy2186,Amy," Hey, Fry.
",11,10,1,10,Fry,Leela2187,Leela," Amy!
",6,10,1,10,Amy,Amy2188,Amy," Leela!
",8,10,1,10,Leela,Zapp2189,Zapp," Ah, the family Wong. Our party is complete.
",45,10,1,10,Amy,Leela2190,Leela,"  What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.
",69,10,1,10,Zapp,Fry2191,Fry,"  Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called Three's Company.
",108,10,1,10,Leela,Zapp2192,Zapp," I'd like to impose a toast on the happy couple. Down the hatch!
",65,10,1,10,Fry,Mrs. Wong2193,Mrs. Wong," Hear, hear! Now let's have a kiss!
",36,10,1,10,Zapp,Zapp2194,Zapp," Yes, Fry. Plant one on your woman.
",36,10,1,10,Mrs. Wong,Fry2195,Fry," Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh. Uh, Mr. Roper--
",93,10,1,10,Zapp,Leo2196,Leo," What's the hold up? Kiss my daughter already!
",47,10,1,10,Fry,Farnsworth2197,Farnsworth," Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, which one of these ladies are you involved with?
",88,10,1,10,Leo,Fry2198,Fry," Uh...
",7,10,1,10,Farnsworth,Kif2199,Kif," Captain, may I have a word with you?
",38,10,1,10,Fry,Zapp2200,Zapp," No.
",5,10,1,10,Kif,Kif2201,Kif," It's an emergency, sir.
",25,10,1,10,Zapp,Zapp2202,Zapp," Come back when it's a catastrophe.  Oh, very well.
",52,10,1,10,Kif,Amy2203,Amy," Well, with Zapp gone and my parents still here, I suggest Fry give me a nice, convincing kiss.
",96,10,1,10,Zapp,Fry2204,Fry," Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy.
",45,10,1,10,Amy,Kif2205,Kif," Sir, remember your course correction?
",39,10,1,10,Fry,Zapp2206,Zapp," No.
",5,10,1,10,Kif,Kif2207,Kif," Well it's proving somewhat more suicidal than we'd initially hoped.
",69,10,1,10,Zapp,Zapp2208,Zapp," Kif, old friend, I don't know which disgusts me more: Your cowardice or your stupidity! We'll simply set a new course for that empty region over there. Near that black-ish hole-ish thing.
",189,10,1,10,Kif,Fry2209,Fry," Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?
",44,10,1,10,Zapp,Leela2210,Leela," I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you were kissing Amy.
",101,10,1,10,Fry,Fry2211,Fry," Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you.
",78,10,1,10,Leela,Leela2212,Leela," Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes.
",64,10,1,10,Fry,Fry2213,Fry," I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her.
",81,10,1,10,Leela,Leela2214,Leela," Nice nebula.
",14,10,1,10,Fry,Fry2215,Fry," Yeah.
",7,10,1,10,Leela,Leela2216,Leela," Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.
",50,10,1,10,Fry,Fry2217,Fry," And me.
",9,10,1,10,Leela,Leela2218,Leela," What was that?  Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole.
",71,10,1,10,Fry,Fry2219,Fry," Talk about a mood killer!
",27,10,1,10,Leela,Zapp2220,Zapp," Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed from the start. Nothing remains now but for the captain to go down with his ship.
",125,10,1,10,Fry,Kif2221,Kif," Why, that's surprisingly noble of you, sir.
",45,10,1,10,Zapp,Zapp2222,Zapp," No, it's noble of you, Kif!  As of now ...  ... you're in command. Congratulations, captain!
",94,10,1,10,Kif,Leela2223,Leela," OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.
",55,10,1,10,Zapp,Farnsworth2224,Farnsworth,"  I'm too young to die!
",24,10,1,10,Leela,Leela2225,Leela," Come on, before it's too late!
",32,10,1,10,Farnsworth,Bender2226,Bender," You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff to steal.
",96,10,1,10,Leela,Fry2227,Fry," You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?
",48,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2228,Bender,"  Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man.
",114,10,1,10,Fry,Fry2229,Fry," I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
",80,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2230,Bender," I love you, buddy!
",20,10,1,10,Fry,Bender2231,Bender,"  Countess? Countess?
",22,10,1,10,Bender,Countess2232,Countess,"  Bender!
",10,10,1,10,Bender,Countess2233,Countess,"  I fell through the deck.
",27,10,1,10,Countess,Bender2234,Bender,"  Are you hurt, my sweet?
",26,10,1,10,Countess,Countess2235,Countess,"  No. Luckily a family broke my fall.
",38,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2236,Bender," Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!
",44,10,1,10,Countess,Countess2237,Countess," Bender, you risked your life to save me.
",42,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2238,Bender," And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it.  When we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist-deep in a pool of cold, rising water.
",154,10,1,10,Countess,Leela2239,Leela," Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!
",46,10,1,10,Bender,Hermes2240,Hermes,"  Faster!
",10,10,1,10,Leela,Leela2241,Leela," It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.
",59,10,1,10,Hermes,Fry2242,Fry," Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!
",57,10,1,10,Leela,Hermes2243,Hermes," No one, except a legendary limbo champion.
",44,10,1,10,Fry,Labarbara2244,Labarbara," Oh, Hermes!
",13,10,1,10,Hermes,Hermes2245,Hermes," Ooh! It's been a while.  This one is for that little kid who's limbo-ing up in heaven right now.
",98,10,1,10,Labarbara,Labarbara2246,Labarbara," That's my man, alright, baby, limbo!
",38,10,1,10,Hermes,Hermes2247,Hermes," I still got the moves! Zoidberg, lower the door another inch.
",63,10,1,10,Labarbara,Labarbara2248,Labarbara," Just go on through and hit the release, you hot dog!
",54,10,1,10,Hermes,Hermes2249,Hermes," Yes, dear.
",12,10,1,10,Labarbara,Labarbara2250,Labarbara," That's my man!
",16,10,1,10,Hermes,Amy2251,Amy," Yay, Hermes!
",14,10,1,10,Labarbara,Hermes2252,Hermes," Uh, can somebody help me up?
",30,10,1,10,Amy,Countess2253,Countess," Well, now what are we going to do?
",36,10,1,10,Hermes,Bender2254,Bender," Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?
",55,10,1,10,Countess,Countess2255,Countess," By God, you're right! I'm a class-3 yacht.
",44,10,1,10,Bender,Farnsworth2256,Farnsworth," Thank God there are plenty of escape pods. We won't have to dress up like women and children.
",95,10,1,10,Countess,Leela2257,Leela," We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must be slowing down his looting.
",102,10,1,10,Farnsworth,Mrs. Wong2258,Mrs. Wong," Amy!
",6,10,1,10,Leela,Amy2259,Amy," Mom? Dad? You're alive!
",25,10,1,10,Mrs. Wong,Leo2260,Leo," Yeah, but so what? The important thing is we found you a new man.
",67,10,1,10,Amy,Mrs. Wong2261,Mrs. Wong," A captain.
",12,10,1,10,Leo,Amy2262,Amy," Uh, Mom, I don't--  Hi!
",25,10,1,10,Mrs. Wong,Kif2263,Kif,"  Hello!
",9,10,1,10,Amy,Farnsworth2264,Farnsworth," I don't feel well!
",20,10,1,10,Kif,Fry2265,Fry," Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment when we almost--  Never mind!
",103,10,1,10,Farnsworth,Hermes2266,Hermes," Everyone else is off the ship. Where in Babylon is Bender?
",60,10,1,10,Fry,Leela2267,Leela," I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.
",45,10,1,10,Hermes,Fry2268,Fry," Goodbye, Bender.
",18,10,1,10,Leela,Bender2269,Bender,"  Wait for us!
",15,10,1,10,Fry,Leela2270,Leela," Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.
",54,10,1,10,Bender,Amy2271,Amy," Well, it's not me!
",20,10,1,10,Leela,Fry2272,Fry," Look!
",7,10,1,10,Amy,Countess2273,Countess," I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too strong!
",47,10,1,10,Fry,Bender2274,Bender," I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!
",52,10,1,10,Countess,Countess2275,Countess," No! You have too much to live for. It may hurt for a while but one day you'll share your love again. After all, it's shareware.
",129,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2276,Bender," Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.
",67,10,1,10,Countess,Countess2277,Countess,"  Farewell!
",12,10,1,10,Bender,Bender2278,Bender,"  No!
",6,10,1,10,Countess,Bender2279,Bender," She's gone.
",13,10,1,10,Bender,Leela2280,Leela," But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away.
",75,10,1,10,Bender,Fry2281,Fry," Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?
",152,10,1,10,Leela,Farnsworth2282,Farnsworth," Oh, yes, absolutely!  Not a chance!
",37,10,1,10,Fry,Bender2283,Bender," At least I'll always have her bracelet!  What do you think it's worth?
",72,10,1,10,Farnsworth,Hermes2284,Hermes," It's fake, mon!
",17,10,1,10,Bender,Farnsworth2285,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone.  We've got a very special delivery today.
",64,11,1,11,Hermes,Fry2286,Fry," Who's it going to?
",20,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2287,Farnsworth," Me.
",5,11,1,11,Fry,Bender2288,Bender," Another job well done.
",24,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2289,Farnsworth," No, I need it shipped to my office at Mars University.  It's a little experiment that may well win me the Nobel Prize.
",120,11,1,11,Bender,Leela2290,Leela," In what field?
",16,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2291,Farnsworth," I don't care, they all pay the same.
",38,11,1,11,Leela,Fry2292,Fry," Is it dangerous?
",18,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2293,Farnsworth," Oh, my, no.  Off we go!
",25,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2294,Fry," Very impressive. Back in the 20th century we had no idea there was a university on Mars.
",90,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2295,Farnsworth," Well, in those days Mars was just a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it was eventually made livable, when the university was founded in 2636.
",180,11,1,11,Fry,Leela2296,Leela," They planted traditional college foliage; ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the whole planet was terraformed.
",100,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Fry2297,Fry," Does that mean it's safe to breathe the air?
",46,11,1,11,Leela,Farnsworth2298,Farnsworth," Of course.
",12,11,1,11,Fry,Farnsworth2299,Farnsworth," Over here is Wong Library. It has the largest collection of literature in the Western Universe.
",97,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Bender2300,Bender,"  Hey, look! There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity, Epsilon Rho Rho.
",76,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Leela2301,Leela," You went to college?
",22,11,1,11,Bender,Bender2302,Bender," Of course. I'm a bender, I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending.
",75,11,1,11,Leela,Fry2303,Fry," What was your minor?
",22,11,1,11,Bender,Bender2304,Bender," Robo-American Studies.
",24,11,1,11,Fry,Fratbot #12305,Fratbot #1," Are you here to fumigate the moose head?
",42,11,1,11,Bender,Bender2306,Bender," Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from way back.
",48,11,1,11,Fratbot #1,Fratbot #12307,Fratbot #1," Eh, close enough. C'mon in.
",29,11,1,11,Bender,Bender2308,Bender," Thanks. Here's your finger back.
",34,11,1,11,Fratbot #1,Bender2309,Bender," All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.
",48,11,1,11,Bender,Fratbot #22310,Fratbot #2," Mate in 143 moves.
",20,11,1,11,Bender,Fratbot #32311,Fratbot #3," Oh, pooh. You win again!
",26,11,1,11,Fratbot #2,Bender2312,Bender," Uh-oh, nerds!
",15,11,1,11,Fratbot #3,Fratbot #12313,Fratbot #1," Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Gearshift, chapter president. This is Oily, and this here is Fat-bot.
",105,11,1,11,Bender,Bender2314,Bender," You're all losers. My name's Bender.
",38,11,1,11,Fratbot #1,Oily2315,Oily," Bender from Bending State Bender? Wow, you're a legend around here!
",69,11,1,11,Bender,Fat-bot2316,Fat-bot," I heard that in one single night you drank a whole keg, streaked across campus and crammed 58 humans into a phone booth.
",122,11,1,11,Oily,Bender2317,Bender,"  Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going.
",69,11,1,11,Fat-bot,Gearshift2318,Gearshift," No, Bender, wait. We're the lamest frat on campus. Even Hillel has better parties than us. Please, you've gotta stay and teach us how to be cool.
",147,11,1,11,Bender,Bender2319,Bender," Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie and a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder.
",121,11,1,11,Gearshift,Fat-bot2320,Fat-bot," Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
",28,11,1,11,Bender,Fry2321,Fry," I tell you, being here really takes me back to my college days.
",65,11,1,11,Fat-bot,Man #12322,Man #1," Step right up. Who wants to learn physics?
",44,11,1,11,Fry,Man #1 #22323,Man #1 #2,"  Keep your hands inside the car at all times.
",47,11,1,11,Man #1,Fry2324,Fry," Good old Coney Island College! Go, Whitefish!
",47,11,1,11,Man #1 #2,Leela2325,Leela," Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but you don't seem like the educated type.
",80,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2326,Fry," Oh, yeah?  Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout.
",63,11,1,11,Leela,Leela2327,Leela," Please! Everyone knows 20th century colleges were basically expensive daycare centres.
",88,11,1,11,Fry,Farnsworth2328,Farnsworth," That's true. By current academic standards, you're merely a high school dropout.
",82,11,1,11,Leela,Fry2329,Fry," What? That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college dropout gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out all over again!
",161,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Leela2330,Leela," You won't last two weeks.
",27,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2331,Fry," Aww, thanks for believing in me.
",34,11,1,11,Leela,Amy2332,Amy," Yo, classmate. What you takin'?
",33,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2333,Fry," Oh, I don't know.  Hey, Professor, what are you teaching this semester?
",73,11,1,11,Amy,Farnsworth2334,Farnsworth," Same thing I teach every semester: The Mathematics of Quantum Neutrino Fields. I made up the title so that no student would dare take it.
",139,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2335,Fry,"  Mathematics of wanton burrito meals.  I'll be there!
",55,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2336,Farnsworth," Please, Fry, I don't know how to teach; I'm a professor!
",58,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2337,Fry," See you in class!
",19,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2338,Farnsworth," Oh!
",5,11,1,11,Fry,Fat-bot2339,Fat-bot," This is gonna be great!
",25,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Bender2340,Bender,"  Bingo!
",9,11,1,11,Fat-bot,Fat-bot2341,Fat-bot,"  Oh, mama!
",12,11,1,11,Bender,Bender2342,Bender,"  Oh, yeah! Someone's been a bad computer!  Get a load of that!
",64,11,1,11,Fat-bot,Meiderneyer2343,Meiderneyer," I say, you've damaged our servants' quarters ... and our servants.
",68,11,1,11,Bender,Chet2344,Chet," This time Robot House has gone too far.
",41,11,1,11,Meiderneyer,Bender2345,Bender," Cheese it!
",12,11,1,11,Chet,Fat-bot2346,Fat-bot,"  They're gonna catch us!
",26,11,1,11,Bender,Fry2347,Fry," Hey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, two chairs, a couple of beds.  A woodpecker.
",88,11,1,11,Fat-bot,Leela2348,Leela," I think that's probably your roommate.
",40,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2349,Fry," Oh, right, cool.  C'mon in, roomie!   What the--?
",51,11,1,11,Leela,Monkey2350,Monkey," I call top bunk!
",18,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2351,Fry," My roommate's a monkey?
",25,11,1,11,Monkey,Monkey2352,Monkey,"  Brilliant deduction, you're a credit to your species.
",56,11,1,11,Fry,Farnsworth2353,Farnsworth," Ah, Fry, I see you've met Guenter!
",36,11,1,11,Monkey,Fry2354,Fry," You know each other?
",22,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2355,Farnsworth," Guenter is my experiment. He was the top secret contents of this stinking crate.
",82,11,1,11,Fry,Guenter2356,Guenter," I'd rather live in a crate than share a room with this dork.
",62,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Leela2357,Leela," So what makes Guenter talk?
",29,11,1,11,Guenter,Fry2358,Fry," Is he genetically engineered?
",31,11,1,11,Leela,Farnsworth2359,Farnsworth," Oh, please! That's preposterous science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's intelligence actually lies in his electronium hat which harnesses the power of sunspots to produce cognitive radiation.
",192,11,1,11,Fry,Guenter2360,Guenter," You're wasting your breath, Professor. He'll never understand a word of it.
",77,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Fry2361,Fry," I understood the word ""hat""!
",30,11,1,11,Guenter,Farnsworth2362,Farnsworth," Please, stop bickering. I arranged that you be roommates for a reason: So I'd only have to remember one phone number. Now shake hands and make up.
",148,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2363,Fry," You want a banana?
",20,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Guenter2364,Guenter," I don't eat bananas. I prefer banana-flavoured energy bars made from tofu.
",76,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2365,Fry," I don't like you.
",19,11,1,11,Guenter,Fry2366,Fry," This is gonna be a cakewalk!
",30,11,1,11,Fry,Teacher2367,Teacher," Welcome to the history of the 20th century. Look to your left, then to your right. Then in nine other directions. One of the 12 of you will not pass this class.
",162,11,1,11,Fry,Amy2368,Amy," Boring.  Let's hear about Walter Mondale already!
",51,11,1,11,Teacher,Teacher2369,Teacher," Be forewarned: The only sure way to get an A in this class is to have lived in the 20th century.
",98,11,1,11,Amy,Fry2370,Fry," Swish!
",8,11,1,11,Teacher,Teacher2371,Teacher," You were saying, Mr. Fry?
",27,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2372,Fry," I'm from the 20th century. Go ahead, ask me anything.
",55,11,1,11,Teacher,Teacher2373,Teacher," Very well. What device invented in the 20th century allowed people to view broadcast programmes in their own homes?
",117,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2374,Fry," Ooh ... I know this ... whatyya call it? Lite Brite!
",54,11,1,11,Teacher,Guenter2375,Guenter," I believe the answer is the television.
",41,11,1,11,Fry,Teacher2376,Teacher," Very good, Mr. ...  ... Guenter.
",34,11,1,11,Guenter,Amy2377,Amy,"  Wow! Smart and cute!
",23,11,1,11,Teacher,Vernon2378,Vernon," What I love about being dean of students is the peace and quiet and the respect I receive.  Now what's all this about?
",120,11,1,11,Amy,Woman #12379,Woman #1,"  Dean Vernon, the students from Robot House are here.
",55,11,1,11,Vernon,Vernon2380,Vernon," Robot House!
",14,11,1,11,Woman #1,Bender2381,Bender," Hey, dean, nice looking model.
",32,11,1,11,Vernon,Vernon2382,Vernon," You keep away from it. You robots are a disgrace to this university. Whenever a fire alarm is pulled, it's Robot House. Whenever the campus liquor store is looted, Robot House. Whenever a human corpse is desecrated--
",218,11,1,11,Bender,Bender2383,Bender," Now, I can explain that.
",26,11,1,11,Vernon,Vernon2384,Vernon," That's enough out of you. From this day forth, Robot House is on dodecatupple-secret probation!
",97,11,1,11,Bender,Bender2385,Bender," No fair!
",10,11,1,11,Vernon,Fat-bot2386,Fat-bot," My mom is gonna kill me!
",26,11,1,11,Bender,Vernon2387,Vernon," Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to the one thing that's kept me sane these past eight years: My model ship.
",122,11,1,11,Fat-bot,Gearshift2388,Gearshift," Fat-bot! No!
",14,11,1,11,Vernon,Fat-bot2389,Fat-bot," When I get nervous I get hungry.
",34,11,1,11,Gearshift,Bender2390,Bender," Cheese it!
",12,11,1,11,Fat-bot,Vernon2391,Vernon,"  Robot House!
",15,11,1,11,Bender,Fry2392,Fry," So, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it off. If you're not doing anything later might I escort you to a kegger?
",111,11,1,11,Vernon,Chrissy2393,Chrissy," Not even if you were the last man on Mars.
",44,11,1,11,Fry,Guenter2394,Guenter,"  Hey! You like bananas?
",25,11,1,11,Chrissy,Guenter2395,Guenter,"  I got her number. How do you like them bananas?
",50,11,1,11,Guenter,Farnsworth2396,Farnsworth," And therefore, by process of elimination, the electron must taste like grapeade.
",82,11,1,11,Guenter,Fry2397,Fry," Sorry, I overslept.
",21,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2398,Farnsworth," Until 5pm?
",12,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2399,Fry," It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept me up all night with his constant thinking. Just thinking and thinking. He's trying to make me look like an idiot.
",152,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2400,Farnsworth," Don't be jealous. Without his special hat, Guenter might be no more intelligent than you.
",91,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2401,Fry," I hate that rodent!
",21,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2402,Farnsworth," Fry, that monkey is my most important experiment. If you two don't stop fighting I'll have you both neutered.
",111,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2403,Fry," That'll show him.
",19,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Amy2404,Amy," Dean Vernon, I'd like you to meet my parents, Leo and Inez.
",61,11,1,11,Fry,Vernon2405,Vernon," Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Wong, I'm so glad we could admit Amy in exchange for your generous contribution.
",99,11,1,11,Amy,Leo2406,Leo," How much more for Phi Beta Kappa?
",35,11,1,11,Vernon,Vernon2407,Vernon," How much you got?
",19,11,1,11,Leo,Guenter2408,Guenter," Sorry I'm late, I was off at a study session ... with Chrissy!
",64,11,1,11,Vernon,Farnsworth2409,Farnsworth," Oh, I'm glad you made it, Guenter because in honour of parents weekend I have a special surprise for you.
",107,11,1,11,Guenter,Guenter2410,Guenter,"  Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?  This is so humiliating.
",62,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Fry2411,Fry," Now these monkeys I like!  What's that? You wanna come out?
",61,11,1,11,Guenter,Guenter2412,Guenter," No! Stop!
",11,11,1,11,Fry,Chet2413,Chet," I say.
",8,11,1,11,Guenter,Farnsworth2414,Farnsworth," What's that they're flinging at us?
",37,11,1,11,Chet,Guenter2415,Guenter," Oh, dear Lord! All over the dean!
",35,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Fry2416,Fry," Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get up on the chandelier with your parents and I'll take a picture?
",101,11,1,11,Guenter,Bender2417,Bender," Well, looks like the party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fat-bot some action.
",107,11,1,11,Fry,Fat-bot2418,Fat-bot," It's my first time, I'm really nervous.
",41,11,1,11,Bender,Vernon2419,Vernon,"  Robot House!
",15,11,1,11,Fat-bot,Leela2420,Leela," What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school special, I think we learned who the real animal was today.
",140,11,1,11,Vernon,Fry2421,Fry," You mean peer pressure?
",25,11,1,11,Leela,Fry2422,Fry," Look out! He's got a gun!
",27,11,1,11,Fry,Guenter2423,Guenter,"  Leave me alone.
",18,11,1,11,Fry,Leela2424,Leela," Hey, what's going on? I thought you didn't like bananas.
",58,11,1,11,Guenter,Guenter2425,Guenter,"  Of course I do. I try so hard to fit in but seeing my parents act like that made me realise I'm just a primitive beast.
",122,11,1,11,Leela,Fry2426,Fry," Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns out like their parents. I mean, look at me. My folks were honest, hard-working people.
",127,11,1,11,Guenter,Leela2427,Leela," Besides, Guenter, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat.
",70,11,1,11,Fry,Guenter2428,Guenter,"  So what? I mean, sure, it looks cool and it makes me smart but it doesn't make me happy.
",91,11,1,11,Leela,Leela2429,Leela," That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry.
",54,11,1,11,Guenter,Guenter2430,Guenter,"  They can't. It's all the hat.
",32,11,1,11,Leela,Fry2431,Fry," Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable here, maybe you should just go back to the jungle.
",90,11,1,11,Guenter,Guenter2432,Guenter," The jungle. But I couldn't do that to the Professor. I'm his prize experiment, and he's like a father to me.
",110,11,1,11,Fry,Leela2433,Leela," But he's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father.
",71,11,1,11,Guenter,Farnsworth2434,Farnsworth," Look at him. I'm so proud.
",28,11,1,11,Leela,Fry2435,Fry," Thanks, Professor!
",20,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2436,Farnsworth," Not you.
",10,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2437,Fry,"  Ow!
",6,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Student2438,Student," Hey!
",6,11,1,11,Fry,Farnsworth2439,Farnsworth," Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why? Why? Why didn't I break his legs?
",88,11,1,11,Student,Farnsworth2440,Farnsworth,"  Oh, poor Guenter.
",20,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Leela2441,Leela," So he just ran away in the middle of the exam?
",48,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2442,Farnsworth," I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with faeces. He tied with Fry.
",84,11,1,11,Leela,Fry2443,Fry," I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.
",75,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2444,Farnsworth," You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain?
",65,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2445,Fry," Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force Guenter to be a human but he's an animal. He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles. Now that's entertainment!
",182,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2446,Farnsworth," But Guenter's obviously better off being intelligent. Tell him, Leela.
",72,11,1,11,Fry,Leela2447,Leela," Nuh-uh, I'm staying out of this. Now here's my opinion: What we should do is...
",81,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2448,Farnsworth," What?
",7,11,1,11,Leela,Leela2449,Leela," I said we'll go to the jungle and let Guenter decide once and for all.
",72,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2450,Farnsworth," What?
",7,11,1,11,Leela,Vernon2451,Vernon," You all know the rules. Whichever house wins the regatta becomes head of the Greek Council. And should that house currently be on any type of multiple secret probation, it will be lifted and I will be forced to serve as Grand Marshal of a parade honouring them.
",263,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Chet2452,Chet," I say, Robot House, your water craft is as ill-designed as you yourselves.
",76,11,1,11,Vernon,Meiderneyer2453,Meiderneyer," Good one, Chet!
",17,11,1,11,Chet,Bender2454,Bender," Oh, yeah? Watch this!
",23,11,1,11,Meiderneyer,Chet2455,Chet," Well, I never!
",16,11,1,11,Bender,Vernon2456,Vernon," Fraternities, on your marks.
",30,11,1,11,Chet,Bender2457,Bender," Hey!
",6,11,1,11,Vernon,Fry2458,Fry," Wow! The jungles on Mars look just like the jungles on Earth.
",63,11,1,11,Bender,Farnsworth2459,Farnsworth," Jungles? On Earth?
",20,11,1,11,Fry,Leela2460,Leela," I see some movement up there. I think it's him.
",49,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2461,Farnsworth," Stand back.
",13,11,1,11,Leela,Leela2462,Leela," Oops.
",7,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2463,Farnsworth," Don't worry. They'll be fine once the tranquiliser wears off.
",63,11,1,11,Leela,Fry2464,Fry," There's our man!
",18,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Leela2465,Leela," Professor, you'll offer Guenter the hat and, Fry, you'll offer him the banana.  We'll let him choose whether he wants to be intelligent or just a mindless animal.
",164,11,1,11,Fry,Farnsworth2466,Farnsworth," Come on, Guenter, take the hat.
",33,11,1,11,Leela,Fry2467,Fry," No, the banana, the banana!
",29,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2468,Farnsworth," Consider the philosophical and metaphysical ramifications of the--
",68,11,1,11,Fry,Fry2469,Fry," Banana, banana, banana!
",25,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Leela2470,Leela," Wait, what's that sound?
",26,11,1,11,Fry,Gearshift2471,Gearshift,"  Hey, Bender, you sure this is a short-cut?
",45,11,1,11,Leela,Bender2472,Bender,"  Not as sure as I was an hour ago!
",36,11,1,11,Gearshift,Vernon2473,Vernon," And the winner is ...  ... Robot House?
",41,11,1,11,Bender,Farnsworth2474,Farnsworth," Oh, dear Lord!
",16,11,1,11,Vernon,Leela2475,Leela," No! No!
",9,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2476,Farnsworth," Thank God this log is sturdy.   Put on the hat, Guenter! You're the only one who can save us!   Stupid monkey.
",112,11,1,11,Leela,Fry2477,Fry,"  No.
",6,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Leela2478,Leela,"  Not there.
",13,11,1,11,Fry,Farnsworth2479,Farnsworth,"  Keep trying.
",15,11,1,11,Leela,Guenter2480,Guenter," Eureka! The hat goes on the head. It's all so obvious now!
",60,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Leela2481,Leela,"  Help us, Guenter!
",20,11,1,11,Guenter,Guenter2482,Guenter," Oh, my goodness.  Hang on. I need to do some calculations.  Got it!  Grab on!
",79,11,1,11,Leela,Farnsworth2483,Farnsworth," We're saved!
",14,11,1,11,Guenter,Fry2484,Fry," 'Preciate it, Guenter!
",24,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Leela2485,Leela," Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the vine. You can still save yourself.
",73,11,1,11,Fry,Guenter2486,Guenter," Why bother? I've got nothing to live for. I was miserable as a genius, and as a monkey, I was so dumb I tried to wear a hat on my butt.   There's just no place for me in this world.  Although, on the other hand--
",214,11,1,11,Leela,Farnsworth2487,Farnsworth," Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Well, let's go gather him up. There's no sense letting him go to waste.
",102,11,1,11,Guenter,Fry2488,Fry," Guenter! You're alive!
",24,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Guenter2489,Guenter," I guess the hat must have broke my fall.
",42,11,1,11,Fry,Farnsworth2490,Farnsworth," It seems to be working at only half-capacity, but I can fix it.
",65,11,1,11,Guenter,Guenter2491,Guenter," No, wait! I like it like this. I actually feel sort of happy.
",63,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2492,Farnsworth," But what about your super-intelligence?
",41,11,1,11,Guenter,Guenter2493,Guenter," When I had that there was too much pressure to use it. All I want out of life is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit. That's why I've decided to transfer to business school!
",196,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2494,Farnsworth,"  Nooo!
",8,11,1,11,Guenter,Bender2495,Bender,"  Come on, everyone! Big party in Robot House!
",47,11,1,11,Farnsworth,Fry2496,Fry," Pizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real TV station, huh?
",57,12,1,12,Bender,Technician2497,Technician," Well, it's a Fox affiliate.
",29,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2498,Fry," What are you showing right now?
",33,12,1,12,Technician,Technician2499,Technician," Single Female Lawyer. It's the season finale. Wanna watch?
",60,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2500,Fry," Ah, I dunno. That's a chick show. I prefer programmes of the genre ""world's blankiest blank"".
",95,12,1,12,Technician,Technician2501,Technician," She is wearing the world's shortiest skirt.
",45,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2502,Fry," I'm in!
",9,12,1,12,Technician,Judge #12503,Judge #1,"  Counselor, I remind you that it's unethical to sleep with your client. If you really care about the outcome of the case, you should sleep with me.
",149,12,1,12,Fry,Single Female Lawyer2504,Single Female Lawyer,"  Your Honour, it's bad enough to proposition a single female lawyer in court, but this is a unisex bathroom.
",110,12,1,12,Judge #1,Judge #12505,Judge #1,"  Overruled, counselor!
",24,12,1,12,Single Female Lawyer,Stenographer2506,Stenographer,"  Could you repeat that last part?
",35,12,1,12,Judge #1,Technician2507,Technician," Oh, my God! You've knocked Fox of the air!
",44,12,1,12,Stenographer,Fry2508,Fry," Pft! Like anyone on Earth cares.
",34,12,1,12,Technician,Stenographer2509,Stenographer,"  Could you repeat that last par--
",35,12,1,12,Fry,Lrrr2510,Lrrr," This is an outrage! I demand to know what happened to the plucky lawyer and her compellingly short garment.
",109,12,1,12,Stenographer,Announcer #12511,Announcer #1,"  Due to technical difficulties, we now bring you eight animated shows in a row.
",81,12,1,12,Lrrr,Hermes2512,Hermes," What in the name of Bob Marley's ghost? Get to work, you lazy boat bag!
",73,12,1,12,Announcer #1,Bender2513,Bender," Ow!
",5,12,1,12,Hermes,Fry2514,Fry," Ow! Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor Day.
",43,12,1,12,Bender,Hermes2515,Hermes," Labor Day? That phoney-baloney holiday crammed down our throats by fat-cat union gangsters?
",93,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2516,Fry," That's the one.
",17,12,1,12,Hermes,Hermes2517,Hermes," Hot damn, a day off!
",22,12,1,12,Fry,Leela2518,Leela," Who's up for one last summer beach trip?
",42,12,1,12,Hermes,Bender2519,Bender," Aw, yeah!
",11,12,1,12,Leela,Hermes2520,Hermes," Ready, Freddy!
",16,12,1,12,Bender,Fry2521,Fry,"  Eh, I think I'll just stay here.
",35,12,1,12,Hermes,Leela2522,Leela," Fry, you're wasting your life sitting in front of that TV. You need to get out and see the real world.
",104,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2523,Fry," But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world!
",67,12,1,12,Leela,Leela2524,Leela," Everyone's too polite to say anything but you're covered with bed sores.
",74,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2525,Fry," Not covered!
",14,12,1,12,Leela,Leela2526,Leela," Just get in the car.
",22,12,1,12,Fry,Farnsworth2527,Farnsworth," Ah, here we are: Monument Beach!
",34,12,1,12,Leela,Fry2528,Fry," Wait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I didn't know they were both in New York!
",95,12,1,12,Farnsworth,Leela2529,Leela," They are now. In the 2600's, New Yorkers elected a super-villain governor, and he stole most of the world's monuments.
",120,12,1,12,Fry,Bender2530,Bender," Truly a great man. Look at him up there.
",42,12,1,12,Leela,Hermes2531,Hermes," Aha!  Found you!
",18,12,1,12,Bender,Bender2532,Bender," OK, now you go hide.  Nice knowin' you.
",41,12,1,12,Hermes,Farnsworth2533,Farnsworth," Come on, Zoidberg, I passed it right to you.
",46,12,1,12,Bender,Zoidberg2534,Zoidberg," I've had it with this game! I'm going for a scuttle!
",54,12,1,12,Farnsworth,Bender2535,Bender," OK, everyone, come and get it!
",32,12,1,12,Zoidberg,Fry2536,Fry," Ah, just like my dad used to make ... until McDonald's fired him.
",67,12,1,12,Bender,Bender2537,Bender," Bite my red-hot glowing ass.  Wait a minute. Red-hot glowing ass?   I'll be right back!  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!  Aw, yeah!
",137,12,1,12,Fry,Amy2538,Amy," No, Nibbler!   Psst, Professor, I need another bikini.
",56,12,1,12,Bender,Farnsworth2539,Farnsworth," Eh ... wha?  Oh, oh, OK, I think there's one can left.  Oh, my.
",65,12,1,12,Amy,Amy2540,Amy," There. How do I look?
",23,12,1,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2541,Farnsworth," Like a cheap French harlot.
",29,12,1,12,Amy,Amy2542,Amy," French?
",9,12,1,12,Farnsworth,Bully2543,Bully," Say, doll-face, how'd you like to make time with a real man?
",62,12,1,12,Amy,Leela2544,Leela," No. I'm not attracted to bullies. No matter how big and ...  ... handsome they are.
",85,12,1,12,Bully,Fry2545,Fry," It's OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot of work to do.
",54,12,1,12,Leela,Bully2546,Bully," Uh, sir, you don't understand. I'm a professional beach bully. I pretend to steal your girl, you punch me, I go down, she swoons, you slip me 50 bucks.
",153,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2547,Fry," 50 bucks? Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her.
",60,12,1,12,Bully,Leela2548,Leela," Fry! Although I suppose we could go for a walk along the beach.
",65,12,1,12,Fry,Bully2549,Bully," Uh, no thanks, ma'am, I'm actually gay.
",41,12,1,12,Leela,Zoidberg2550,Zoidberg," Uh-oh.  Help! Help!  Bender, you gotta spring me. I'll never survive in here; I'm too pretty!
",95,12,1,12,Bully,Bender2551,Bender," Alright, alright, I'll bust you out.  Cheese it!
",50,12,1,12,Zoidberg,Fry2552,Fry," Voila. The greatest sandcastle ever built. This is the kind of castle King Arthur would have lived in, if he were a fiddler crab.
",131,12,1,12,Bender,Leela2553,Leela," It's very nice. We should get a picture before the tide comes in.
",67,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2554,Fry," Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?
",34,12,1,12,Leela,Bender2555,Bender," Right here, buddy.  Wait, I wanna be in the picture too.  Pretend you're happy.
",81,12,1,12,Fry,Zoidberg2556,Zoidberg," Yay!
",6,12,1,12,Bender,Leela2557,Leela," Oh, my God!
",13,12,1,12,Zoidberg,Hermes2558,Hermes," What in Babylon?
",18,12,1,12,Leela,Fry2559,Fry,"  Nooo!
",8,12,1,12,Hermes,Hermes2560,Hermes," Faster!
",9,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2561,Fry," We're all gonna die, aren't we?
",33,12,1,12,Hermes,Farnsworth2562,Farnsworth," Oh, I should think so. Although last time aliens invaded all they did was force the most intelligent of us to pair off and mate continuously.  Oh, yes!
",153,12,1,12,Fry,Linda2563,Linda,"  Once again, today's winning lotto number was 4. In other news, alien saucers continue to rain destruction upon Earth. We now go live to an emergency address by Earth President McNeal.
",186,12,1,12,Farnsworth,McNeal2564,McNeal,"  Ladies and gentlemen, our course is clear. The time has come to knuckle under. To get down on all fours and really lick boot. Give our alien masters whatever they want a--
",174,12,1,12,Linda,Lrrr2565,Lrrr,"  People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.  Is this thing on?  Now then: We want the one you call ""McNeal"". Give us McNeal or we will lay waste to your cities with our anti-monument laser. We demand McNeal!
",225,12,1,12,McNeal,McNeal2566,McNeal,"  Uh, as I was saying ...  ... mankind would sooner perish than kowtow to outrageous alien demands for this McNeal ... whoever he is. Am I right?  And now, the man who will lead us in our proud struggle for freedom, fresh from his bloody triumph over the pacifists of the Gandhi Nebula, 25-star General Zapp Brannigan!
",319,12,1,12,Lrrr,Man #12567,Man #1,"  Yeah!
",8,12,1,12,McNeal,Bender2568,Bender," Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic windbag you slept with.
",61,12,1,12,Man #1,Leela2569,Leela," The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?
",61,12,1,12,Bender,Bender2570,Bender," Evidently not.
",16,12,1,12,Leela,Zapp2571,Zapp,"  Call me cocky, but if there's an alien out there I can't kill, I haven't met him and killed him yet. But I can't go it alone.  That's why I'm ordering every available ship to report for duty. Anyone without a ship should secure a weapon and fire wildly into the air.
",269,12,1,12,Bender,Leela2572,Leela," Well, you heard the windbag: We've been drafted. Everyone into the ship.
",74,12,1,12,Zapp,Bender2573,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse to fight. I'm a conscientious objector.
",83,12,1,12,Leela,Fry2574,Fry," A what?
",9,12,1,12,Bender,Bender2575,Bender," You know, a coward.
",21,12,1,12,Fry,Zapp2576,Zapp,"  Since this is an emergency, all robots will now have their patriotism circuits activated.
",92,12,1,12,Bender,Bender2577,Bender," It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity.  Oh, crap!
",80,12,1,12,Zapp,Zapp2578,Zapp," We're all from different cultures here. Some of you are white, some of you are black.  You're brown.  And you're silver. But I don't care if your skin's red or tan or Chinese. You're all going to have to learn to die together.  Am I right, soldier?
",250,12,1,12,Bender,Bender2579,Bender," Well, actually, I--  Sir, yes, sir! Sir!
",42,12,1,12,Zapp,Zapp2580,Zapp," Remember, our mission is simple: Destroy all aliens!
",54,12,1,12,Bender,Kif2581,Kif," Um, uh, not me, sir.
",22,12,1,12,Zapp,Zapp2582,Zapp," Oh, yes, right. Nobody destroy Kif.  Unless you have to.   Oh, ho, ho! The luscious Captain Leela.  This is turning into one very sex-ay struggle for the future of the human race!
",181,12,1,12,Kif,Leela2583,Leela," Thanks, but I'm not technically human.
",40,12,1,12,Zapp,Zapp2584,Zapp," Right, right. Nobody destroy Leela either.
",44,12,1,12,Leela,Zapp2585,Zapp," The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well-made bed. You will practise until you can make your bed in your sleep.
",128,12,1,12,Zapp,Fry2586,Fry," You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
",36,12,1,12,Zapp,Zapp2587,Zapp," You won't have time for sleeping, soldier. Not with all the bed-making you'll be doing.
",89,12,1,12,Fry,Zapp2588,Zapp," The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.  Now, like all great plans, my strategy is so simple an idiot could have devised it. On my command, all ships will line up and file directly into the alien death cannons, clogging them with wreckage.
",338,12,1,12,Zapp,Fry2589,Fry," W-Wouldn't it make more sense to send the robots in first a--
",63,12,1,12,Zapp,Bender2590,Bender," Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission.  Aw, cut it out!
",58,12,1,12,Fry,Zapp2591,Zapp," You're a brave robot, son. But when I'm in command every mission's a suicide mission. Which reminds me.  Leela, perhaps before we head into battle you'd like to make love to me, in case one of us doesn't come back.
",216,12,1,12,Bender,Leela2592,Leela," Maybe we should wait till afterwards, in case neither of us comes back.
",73,12,1,12,Zapp,Zapp2593,Zapp," Here's hoping.
",16,12,1,12,Leela,Fry2594,Fry," I'm gonna be a science-fiction hero, just like Uhura, or Captain Janeway, or Xena!
",84,12,1,12,Zapp,Leela2595,Leela,"  Fry, this isn't TV, it's real life. Can't you tell the difference?
",69,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2596,Fry," Sure, I just like TV better.
",30,12,1,12,Leela,Leela2597,Leela," Bender, damage report.
",24,12,1,12,Fry,Bender2598,Bender," The auxiliary power's out, and they spilled my cocktail.
",58,12,1,12,Leela,Fry2599,Fry," Alright, scumwads. This one's for Bender's cocktail!
",54,12,1,12,Bender,Leela2600,Leela," We did it! We won!
",20,12,1,12,Fry,Bender2601,Bender,"  Yeah, but it'll never bring back my martini.   Well, who wants a martini?
",76,12,1,12,Leela,Zapp2602,Zapp,"  Good work, everyone. The mothership is destroyed.
",52,12,1,12,Bender,Zapp2603,Zapp," What the hell is that thing?
",30,12,1,12,Zapp,Kif2604,Kif," It appears to be the mothership.
",34,12,1,12,Zapp,Zapp2605,Zapp," Then what did we just blow up?
",32,12,1,12,Kif,Kif2606,Kif," The Hubble Telescope.
",23,12,1,12,Zapp,Zapp2607,Zapp,"  Stop exploding, you cowards!
",31,12,1,12,Kif,Leela2608,Leela," This is hopeless.  If we're gonna get blown to bits, we might as well do it in the comfort of our own home.
",109,12,1,12,Zapp,Farnsworth2609,Farnsworth," You'll be the captain, you'll be the delivery boy, and you'll be the alcoholic, foul-mouthed--  Oh, God, you're alive. I mean, thank God you're alive!  Sorry, check back in three days, a week at the most.
",206,12,1,12,Leela,Lrrr2610,Lrrr,"  We want McNeal! Stop stalling!
",33,12,1,12,Farnsworth,Linda2611,Linda,"  And now a rebuttal from President McNeal.
",44,12,1,12,Lrrr,McNeal2612,McNeal,"  The people of Earth remain united in my refusal to hand over myself. Total annihilation is a small price to pay compared with--
",130,12,1,12,Linda,Zapp2613,Zapp,"  Here he is! Come and get him!
",32,12,1,12,McNeal,Lrrr2614,Lrrr," You are not McNeal.
",21,12,1,12,Zapp,Zapp2615,Zapp,"  Huh?
",7,12,1,12,Lrrr,McNeal2616,McNeal,"  Huh?
",7,12,1,12,Zapp,Ndnd2617,Ndnd," You are not the one we want.
",30,12,1,12,McNeal,McNeal2618,McNeal,"  Oh, thank you. Thank you, glorious masters! I--
",50,12,1,12,Ndnd,Lrrr2619,Lrrr," Give us McNeal!
",17,12,1,12,McNeal,Zapp2620,Zapp," That was McNeal.
",18,12,1,12,Lrrr,Ndnd2621,Ndnd," No, McNeal, the single female lawyer.
",39,12,1,12,Zapp,Lrrr2622,Lrrr," She wears miniskirts and is promiscuous.
",42,12,1,12,Ndnd,Zapp2623,Zapp,"  Really?
",10,12,1,12,Lrrr,Fry2624,Fry," Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.
",35,12,1,12,Zapp,Lrrr2625,Lrrr," Surely you know McNeal. She is an unmarried human female struggling to succeed in a human male's world.
",105,12,1,12,Fry,Zapp2626,Zapp," Maybe that's just her excuse for being incompetent.
",53,12,1,12,Lrrr,Lrrr2627,Lrrr,"  Silence!  We will accept no more decoys.  This is the McNeal.
",64,12,1,12,Zapp,Fry2628,Fry," Wait, I know her.
",19,12,1,12,Lrrr,Leela2629,Leela," You do not, you big fat liar. You don't know anyone. All you do is watch TV.
",78,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2630,Fry," That's where I know her from. She's Jenny McNeal. She was a character on a TV show back in the 20th century, Single Female Lawyer.
",132,12,1,12,Leela,Bender2631,Bender," Well if they're hoping to see a TV show that hasn't existed for a thousand years, pft, they are royally boned.
",112,12,1,12,Fry,Lrrr2632,Lrrr,"  We will raise your planet's temperature by one million degrees a day, for five days, unless we see McNeal at 9pm tomorrow -- 8 central!
",138,12,1,12,Bender,Farnsworth2633,Farnsworth,"  I'm beginning to think there'll be no forced mating at all.
",62,12,1,12,Lrrr,Leela2634,Leela," They're going to destroy the entire Earth if they don't see some stupid TV show about some bimbo lawyer?
",106,12,1,12,Farnsworth,Fry2635,Fry," It's crazy! How could they even know about a show from a thousand years ago?
",78,12,1,12,Leela,Farnsworth2636,Farnsworth," Well, Omicron Persei 8 is about a thousand light years away. So the electro-magnetic waves would just recently have gotten there. You see--
",141,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2637,Fry," Magic. Got it.
",16,12,1,12,Farnsworth,Amy2638,Amy," Check this out: Back in 1999 the season finale of Single Female Lawyer was interrupted by technical problems. Apparently some zidiot spilled Coke on the transmitter.
",167,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2639,Fry," Beer-- I would think.
",23,12,1,12,Amy,Bender2640,Bender," They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.
",78,12,1,12,Fry,Amy2641,Amy," There aren't any copies left.
",31,12,1,12,Bender,Farnsworth2642,Farnsworth," No, there wouldn't be. Most videotapes from that era were damaged in 2443 during the Second Coming of Jesus.
",110,12,1,12,Amy,Fry2643,Fry," Y'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of that episode. If I could make up an ending, maybe we could act it out ourselves.
",120,12,1,12,Farnsworth,Zoidberg2644,Zoidberg," I could make the costumes.
",28,12,1,12,Fry,Farnsworth2645,Farnsworth," I have an old five-megawatt broadcasting tower in the attic.
",62,12,1,12,Zoidberg,Bender2646,Bender,"  And I, I could be an acting coach!
",37,12,1,12,Farnsworth,Fry2647,Fry," Let's put on a show.
",22,12,1,12,Bender,Fry2648,Fry," OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--
",42,12,1,12,Fry,Leela2649,Leela," Uh-uh, forget it. A, I'm camera shy; and B, I get tongue tied in front of an audience armed with death rays.
",110,12,1,12,Fry,Amy2650,Amy," Plus, you don't really have the thighs for a miniskirt.
",57,12,1,12,Leela,Leela2651,Leela," Gimme the script.
",19,12,1,12,Amy,Fry2652,Fry," Places, everyone.
",19,12,1,12,Leela,Amy2653,Amy," OK ... all set!
",17,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2654,Fry," Lights!  Camera one!  Camera two!  Camera three!
",50,12,1,12,Amy,Lrrr2655,Lrrr," Prepare the water cooler, that we may gather around it later and discuss things.
",82,12,1,12,Fry,Bender2656,Bender,"  Single Female Lawyer,
Fighting for her client,
Wearing sexy miniskirts,
",74,12,1,12,Lrrr,Bender2657,Bender,"  And being self-reliant.
 Hey, I'm pretty good!
",49,12,1,12,Bender,Farnsworth2658,Farnsworth," Uh ...  ... Jenny McNeal, you are charged with jury-tampering in last week's case ...  ... on account of your hot, naked affair with the foreman. How do you plead?
",165,12,1,12,Bender,Leela2659,Leela,"  Your Honour, I move for a mistrial, on the grounds that I'm also having a hot, naked affair with the foreman of this jury.
",125,12,1,12,Farnsworth,Hermes2660,Hermes,"  I'll see you during the recess!
",34,12,1,12,Leela,Lrrr2661,Lrrr," If McNeal wishes to be taken seriously why does she not simply tear the judge's head off?
",91,12,1,12,Hermes,Ndnd2662,Ndnd," It is true what they say; ""Women are from Omicron Persei 7, men are from Omicron Persei 9"".
",93,12,1,12,Lrrr,Farnsworth2663,Farnsworth,"  Your witness, Prosecutor Ramirez.
",36,12,1,12,Ndnd,Zoidberg2664,Zoidberg," Gracias.  Single Female Lawyer, where were you on the night of August 23rd?
",77,12,1,12,Farnsworth,Leela2665,Leela," Sleeping with you.
",20,12,1,12,Zoidberg,Zoidberg2666,Zoidberg," Aha!
",6,12,1,12,Leela,Leela2667,Leela," Uh, g-- uh, getting back to the, uh, matter, uh-uh, if it please the court...  Fry, there's nothing else here. You only wrote two pages of dialogue.
",150,12,1,12,Zoidberg,Fry2668,Fry," Well, it took an hour to write. I thought it would take an hour to read.
",74,12,1,12,Leela,Leela2669,Leela," What are we supposed to do now?
",33,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2670,Fry," I don't know, I don't know. Just say anything. As long as it's compelling, mesmerising, a tour de force.
",106,12,1,12,Leela,Leela2671,Leela," Uh...
",7,12,1,12,Fry,Farnsworth2672,Farnsworth,"  What say you, Single Female Lawyer?
",38,12,1,12,Leela,Leela2673,Leela," I say ... I'm giving up the law.  And I'm giving up being single. Your Honour, will you marry me?
",99,12,1,12,Farnsworth,Fry2674,Fry," No, no! Go to commercial!
",27,12,1,12,Leela,Bender2675,Bender," We'll be back after this word from Crazy Bender's Discount Stereo.
",68,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2676,Fry," Married? Jenny can't get married.
",35,12,1,12,Bender,Leela2677,Leela," Why not? It's clever, it's unexpected.
",40,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2678,Fry," But that's not why people watch TV. Clever things make people feel stupid, and unexpected things make them feel scared.
",121,12,1,12,Leela,Lrrr2679,Lrrr," Â : Attention, McNeal. Your unexpected marriage plan scares us. You stole our hearts as a single female lawyer, and so shall you remain -- or else!
",148,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2680,Fry," You see? TV audiences don't want anything original. They wanna see the same thing they've seen a thousand times before.
",121,12,1,12,Lrrr,Bender2681,Bender,"  Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Fry?
",31,12,1,12,Fry,Fry2682,Fry," Trust me on this. While other people were out living their lives, I wasted mine watching TV, because deep down I knew it might one day help me save the world. Plus, I would have lost my Workman's Comp if I had gone outside. Now just read these cue cards.
",256,12,1,12,Bender,Fry2683,Fry," And action!
",13,12,1,12,Fry,Farnsworth2684,Farnsworth,"  Miss McNeal, I'm afraid I must decline your offer of marriage. For, you see, I'm dying. Cough, then fall over dead.
",118,12,1,12,Fry,Zoidberg2685,Zoidberg,"  My God, he's dead.
",21,12,1,12,Farnsworth,Leela2686,Leela,"  I will now make my closing statement. With my fiancÃ© deceased ...  ... I hereby return to my single female lawyer career. No matter what any man says.
",153,12,1,12,Zoidberg,Hermes2687,Hermes," We find the defendant vulnerable yet spunky!
",46,12,1,12,Leela,Zoidberg2688,Zoidberg,"  Hooray!
",10,12,1,12,Hermes,Amy2689,Amy,"  Hooray!
",10,12,1,12,Zoidberg,Fry2690,Fry," And ... cut!
",14,12,1,12,Amy,Bender2691,Bender,"  Single Female Lawyer,
Having lot's of sex--
 Huh?
",52,12,1,12,Fry,Lrrr2692,Lrrr,"  Attention, McNeal. We are reasonably satisfied with the events we have seen. Overall I would rate it a C+, OK, not great.  As a result, we will not destroy your planet. But neither will we provide you with our recipe for immortality.
",236,12,1,12,Bender,Fry2693,Fry," Way to overact ,Zoidberg!
",27,12,1,12,Lrrr,Lrrr2694,Lrrr,"  And now we must return to our planet, to catch the end of a thousand-year-old Leno monologue.
",96,12,1,12,Fry,Bender2695,Bender," You did it, Fry!
",18,12,1,12,Lrrr,Fry2696,Fry," Yep.  It was just a matter of knowing the secret of all TV shows: At the end of the episode, everything's always right back to normal.
",136,12,1,12,Bender,Calculon2697,Calculon,"  Honey unit, I'm home.  Monique!
",34,13,1,13,Fry,Monique2698,Monique,"  Calculon!
",12,13,1,13,Calculon,Calculon2699,Calculon,"  Oh, how I wish I could believe that. You may be my evil half-brother, but there's no law against murdering the other half.
",125,13,1,13,Monique,Announcer #1 #12700,Announcer #1 #1,"  All My Circuits will be right back after this word from...
",61,13,1,13,Calculon,Announcer #1 #22701,Announcer #1 #2,"  Slurm! It's highly addictive!
",32,13,1,13,Announcer #1 #1,Trixie2702,Trixie,"  Look! It's Slurms MacKenzie!
",31,13,1,13,Announcer #1 #2,Dixie2703,Dixie,"  He's the original party worm!
",32,13,1,13,Trixie,Slurms2704,Slurms,"  Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Let's party!
",40,13,1,13,Dixie,Bender2705,Bender," Look at that worm go. Who says there are no more heroes?
",58,13,1,13,Slurms,Slurms2706,Slurms,"  Hey, dudes, you can win a chance to party with me, Slurms MacKenzie, at the Slurm bottling plant on planet Wormulon!
",119,13,1,13,Bender,Announcer #1 #22707,Announcer #1 #2,"  Just look for the winning bottle-cap inside specially-marked cans of Slurm.
",78,13,1,13,Slurms,Trixie2708,Trixie," I won!
",8,13,1,13,Announcer #1 #2,Announcer #1 #22709,Announcer #1 #2,"  No purchase necessary unless you wish to enter the contest. Odds of winning mathematically insignificant.
",108,13,1,13,Trixie,Fry2710,Fry," I like those odds.  Rats. Just another tooth.
",47,13,1,13,Announcer #1 #2,Fry2711,Fry," I gotta find that golden bottle-cap.
",38,13,1,13,Fry,Leela2712,Leela," I've never seen anyone so addicted to Slurm.
",46,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2713,Fry," This is nothing. Back in high school I used to drink a hundred cans of cola a week. Right up until my third heart attack.
",123,13,1,13,Leela,Leela2714,Leela," Bender, what's wrong?
",23,13,1,13,Fry,Bender2715,Bender," I'm sick.
",11,13,1,13,Leela,Leela2716,Leela," You poor baby. Let me check if you have a fever.  Ow!
",55,13,1,13,Bender,Farnsworth2717,Farnsworth," According to Bender's temperature gauge, which I suggest you use next time, Leela, he's running a fever of ... 900 degrees.
",125,13,1,13,Leela,Hermes2718,Hermes," Bender, mon, lie yourself down.  You're payin' for that!
",58,13,1,13,Farnsworth,Zoidberg2719,Zoidberg," I'll have a look, but I remind you, I'm an expert on humans not robots.
",73,13,1,13,Hermes,Fry2720,Fry," I'm not Bender, I'm Fry.
",26,13,1,13,Zoidberg,Zoidberg2721,Zoidberg," Really? I though you were the robot.
",38,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2722,Fry," Nope. Human.
",14,13,1,13,Zoidberg,Zoidberg2723,Zoidberg," Alright, alright, spare me your life story.  Now what seems to be the trouble?
",80,13,1,13,Fry,Bender2724,Bender," My tummy hurts and I've been having this burning electrical discharge.
",72,13,1,13,Zoidberg,Zoidberg2725,Zoidberg," Hmm. Don't worry, you'll be fine.   Oh boy.  I didn't have the heart to tell him: It's fin fungus. He'll be floating upside-down by morning.
",142,13,1,13,Bender,Amy2726,Amy," You should try homeopathic medicine, Bender. Take some zinc.
",62,13,1,13,Zoidberg,Bender2727,Bender," I'm 40% zinc.
",15,13,1,13,Amy,Amy2728,Amy," Then take some Echinacea or a St. John's wort.
",48,13,1,13,Bender,Farnsworth2729,Farnsworth," Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same crap.
",47,13,1,13,Amy,Leela2730,Leela," Hey, what's rattling around in there?
",39,13,1,13,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2731,Farnsworth," It may well be the cause of Bender's illness. But more importantly, it's a flimsy pretext to try out my latest invention. To the laboratory!
",142,13,1,13,Leela,Farnsworth2732,Farnsworth," I call this the F-ray. It's like an X-ray only it allows you to see through anything, even metal. Now, the neutrino beam it emits is a tad dangerous, so you'll all need protective goggles.  You may feel a slight stinging sensation -- all of you!  Aha! There's the cause of your illness.
",288,13,1,13,Farnsworth,Amy2733,Amy," Hey, that's my watch!
",23,13,1,13,Farnsworth,Bender2734,Bender," I was wondering where I put that.  Hey, now I feel much better! Thanks, Professor. And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch.
",123,13,1,13,Amy,Farnsworth2735,Farnsworth," Well, I've got to go take this suit to the decontaminators. You two lock up the F-ray and for the love of God don't let it fall into the wrong hands.
",151,13,1,13,Bender,Bender2736,Bender," What should we point it at first?
",35,13,1,13,Farnsworth,Fry2737,Fry," I 'unno. Try it on me.  Ow! My sperm!
",39,13,1,13,Bender,Bender2738,Bender," Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?
",38,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2739,Fry," Huh, didn't hurt that time.
",29,13,1,13,Bender,Bender2740,Bender," Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady.
",36,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2741,Fry," What's wrong?
",15,13,1,13,Bender,Bender2742,Bender," That's no lady!
",17,13,1,13,Fry,Fembot #12743,Fembot #1," Damn Chico! One more upgrade and I'll be more lady than you can handle! Why you so stupid, stupid?
",100,13,1,13,Bender,Bender2744,Bender," Hey, bite my shiny metal ass!
",31,13,1,13,Fembot #1,Fembot #12745,Fembot #1," You couldn't afford it, honey.
",32,13,1,13,Bender,Fry2746,Fry," All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty.  Ah, if only there was some way of knowing which can had the winning bottle-cap inside.
",152,13,1,13,Fembot #1,Bender2747,Bender," Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was too busy using this F-ray to look inside of things.
",91,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2748,Fry," Wait a second. I'm getting an idea. N-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Wait. No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. Yes!
",118,13,1,13,Bender,Bender2749,Bender," Ah, this thing stinks.
",24,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2750,Fry," We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and all we won was this junk.  I never wanna see another can of Slurm again. Man, am I thirsty.
",129,13,1,13,Bender,Leela2751,Leela," Fry, are you alright?
",23,13,1,13,Fry,Bender2752,Bender," You did it, Fry! You found the winning bottle-cap! We won!
",60,13,1,13,Leela,Fry2753,Fry,"  Hooray!
",10,13,1,13,Bender,Leela2754,Leela," Ooh, look at that!
",20,13,1,13,Fry,Bender2755,Bender," Hey!
",6,13,1,13,Leela,Glurmo2756,Glurmo," Welcome to the planet Wormulon. I'm Glurmo, your golly-rific guide to the splend-tacular Slurm factory.
",105,13,1,13,Bender,Fry2757,Fry," Uh-huh. Can we have our free Slurm now?
",41,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2758,Glurmo," You'll have all the Slurm you can drink later on when you're partying with my good friend, Slurms MacKenzie.
",110,13,1,13,Fry,Slurms2759,Slurms," Alright! Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Lay some skin on me, dudes!
",63,13,1,13,Glurmo,Bender2760,Bender," Wow! The original party worm!  Are you ready to get down, get funky with us?
",78,13,1,13,Slurms,Glurmo2761,Glurmo," He'd better be, that's what we pay him for. Right, Slurms?
",60,13,1,13,Bender,Slurms2762,Slurms," Right!
",8,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2763,Glurmo," In fact, Slurms has to party all night, every night, or he's fired!
",69,13,1,13,Slurms,Slurms2764,Slurms,"  Rock on!
",11,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2765,Glurmo," But before the party, you're all in for a fun-derful treat: A VIP tour of the Slurm factory!
",94,13,1,13,Slurms,Slurms2766,Slurms," Enjoy the tour, dudes!  I'm gonna go lie down.
",48,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2767,Glurmo," Welcome, my friends, to the wondrous world of whimsy that we like to call ""Slurms Centralised Industrial Fabrication Unit"".
",125,13,1,13,Slurms,Farnsworth2768,Farnsworth," Oh, my!
",9,13,1,13,Glurmo,Bender2769,Bender," Look! Flowers! And a boat!
",28,13,1,13,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2770,Farnsworth," Who are those horrible orange creatures over there?
",53,13,1,13,Bender,Glurmo2771,Glurmo," Why, those are the Grunka Lunkas. They work here in the Slurm factory.
",72,13,1,13,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2772,Farnsworth," Tell them I hate them.
",24,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2773,Glurmo," As we sail down the river of Slurm you'll see our mix-ologists at work.  They take 900 of the finest ingredients, add a touch of child-like delight and mix it all with glacial spring water from our glacial spring water generator.  Then, last of all, we add the secret ingredient that makes Slurm so deliciously addictive.
",323,13,1,13,Farnsworth,Fry2774,Fry," So, what's the secret ingredient?
",35,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2775,Glurmo," It's whatever your imagination wants it to be.
",48,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2776,Fry," Oh. But what is it really?
",28,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2777,Glurmo,"  That's not for you to know.  Now, over here the Grunka Lunkas are inducing Wumpus berries to release their flavour, using sensual massage.
",141,13,1,13,Fry,Bender2778,Bender,"  Psst, those berries. Those are the secret ingredient, right?
",63,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2779,Glurmo," No.
",5,13,1,13,Bender,Bender2780,Bender," You positive?
",15,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2781,Glurmo," Yes.
",6,13,1,13,Bender,Bender2782,Bender," I'm just asking cause they look kind of secret.
",49,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2783,Glurmo," Enough! There will be no further questions.
",45,13,1,13,Bender,Fry2784,Fry," Why?
",6,13,1,13,Glurmo,Leela2785,Leela," Hey, look! The disgusting little men are starting to sing.
",60,13,1,13,Fry,Grunka Lunkas2786,Grunka Lunkas,"  Grunka Lunka dunkity-do,
We've got a friendly warning for you,
Grunka Lunka dunkity-dasis,
The secret of Slurm's on a need-to-know basis.
",140,13,1,13,Leela,Grunka Lunka #12787,Grunka Lunka #1,"  Asking questions in school is a great way to learn.
",54,13,1,13,Grunka Lunkas,Grunka Lunka #22788,Grunka Lunka #2,"  If you try that stuff here you might get your legs broke.
",60,13,1,13,Grunka Lunka #1,Grunka Lunka #12789,Grunka Lunka #1,"  We once found a dead guy face down in the Slurm.
",51,13,1,13,Grunka Lunka #2,Grunka Lunka #22790,Grunka Lunka #2,"  It could easily happen again to you folks.
",45,13,1,13,Grunka Lunka #1,Grunka Lunkas2791,Grunka Lunkas,"  So keep you head down,
And keep your mouth shut,
Grunka Lunka lunka dunkity dot!
",83,13,1,13,Grunka Lunka #2,Glurmo2792,Glurmo,"  Hey, I don't pay you to sing! You just used up today's bathroom break!
",73,13,1,13,Grunka Lunkas,Grunka Lunka #22793,Grunka Lunka #2," Hard ass.
",11,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2794,Glurmo,"  I heard that!
",16,13,1,13,Grunka Lunka #2,Glurmo2795,Glurmo," Now, on your right, you'll see the Slurm Master checking the Slurm for colour and bouquet.
",92,13,1,13,Glurmo,Fry2796,Fry," So thirsty.
",13,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2797,Glurmo," Then he tastes it. He tastes it and tastes it, then tastes it some more.
",74,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2798,Fry," Uh, could I have some Slurm, please?
",38,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2799,Glurmo," No food or drink allowed on the tour. You'll have to wait until you're partying with Slurms MacKenzie.
",104,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2800,Fry," When will that be?
",20,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2801,Glurmo," Soon enough.
",14,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2802,Fry," That's not soon enough.
",25,13,1,13,Glurmo,Leela2803,Leela," Hey, what's behind that door?
",31,13,1,13,Fry,Glurmo2804,Glurmo," Nothing.
",10,13,1,13,Leela,Leela2805,Leela," Is it the secret ingredient?
",30,13,1,13,Glurmo,Grunka Lunkas2806,Grunka Lunkas,"  Grunka Lunka dunkity dingredient,
You should not ask about the secret ingredient.
",84,13,1,13,Leela,Bender2807,Bender," OK, OK, we get the point.
",27,13,1,13,Grunka Lunkas,Leela2808,Leela," I was just curious because of the armed guards.
",49,13,1,13,Bender,Grunka Lunkas2809,Grunka Lunkas,"  Grunka Lunka dunkity darmed guards--
",39,13,1,13,Leela,Bender2810,Bender,"  Shut the hell up!
",20,13,1,13,Grunka Lunkas,Hermes2811,Hermes," So you're telling me I could fire my whole staff and hire Grunka Lunkas at half the cost?
",91,13,1,13,Bender,Glurmo2812,Glurmo," That's right. They think they have a good union but they don't.  They're basically slaves.
",92,13,1,13,Hermes,Leela2813,Leela," What are you doing?
",21,13,1,13,Glurmo,Fry2814,Fry," I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and dunk my head in so I can drink.
",71,13,1,13,Leela,Leela2815,Leela," No. That's moronic.
",21,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2816,Fry," Fine. I'll let go and swim around in the Slurm and drink as much as I want.  Help! I can't swim!
",98,13,1,13,Leela,Leela2817,Leela," Bender, why did you jump in?
",30,13,1,13,Fry,Bender2818,Bender," Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to be popular.
",54,13,1,13,Leela,Bender2819,Bender," Ow!
",5,13,1,13,Bender,Leela2820,Leela," Where are we?
",15,13,1,13,Bender,Bender2821,Bender," And why is the Slurm pouring into this sewer?
",47,13,1,13,Leela,Fry2822,Fry," This isn't Slurm at all!
",26,13,1,13,Bender,Leela2823,Leela," Something's rotten on the planet Wormulon. Look at this.
",58,13,1,13,Fry,Leela2824,Leela," This all must have something to do with the secret ingredient.
",64,13,1,13,Leela,Fry2825,Fry," My God. What if the secret ingredient ... is people?
",54,13,1,13,Leela,Leela2826,Leela," No. There's already a soda like that: Soylent Cola.
",53,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2827,Fry," Oh. How is it?
",16,13,1,13,Leela,Leela2828,Leela," It varies from person to person.
",34,13,1,13,Fry,Farnsworth2829,Farnsworth," Ooh!
",6,13,1,13,Leela,Zoidberg2830,Zoidberg," Do you have any that aren't so tight around the thorax?
",57,13,1,13,Farnsworth,Glurmo2831,Glurmo," Yes, over in-- Say, weren't there more people in your group at the start of the tour?
",87,13,1,13,Zoidberg,Amy2832,Amy," Hey, yeah. Fry, Leela and Bender are missing.
",47,13,1,13,Glurmo,Glurmo2833,Glurmo," If you'll excuse me.
",22,13,1,13,Amy,Leela2834,Leela,"  Quick.
",9,13,1,13,Glurmo,Fry2835,Fry," Look! Slurm! Finally!  Oh, yeah! I'm never going 12 minutes without a Slurm again.
",84,13,1,13,Leela,Leela2836,Leela," It's the end of the line. This must be where they put in the secret ingredient.
",81,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2837,Fry," Well, whatever it is, it's even better fresh.  Mmm, still warm.
",65,13,1,13,Leela,Fry2838,Fry," Ew!
",5,13,1,13,Fry,Leela2839,Leela," Blech!
",8,13,1,13,Fry,Bender2840,Bender," Oh, Lordy!
",12,13,1,13,Leela,Leela2841,Leela," Fry!  Fry!
",12,13,1,13,Bender,Fry2842,Fry," That's the secret ingredient of Slurm?
",40,13,1,13,Leela,Leela2843,Leela," That's the only ingredient of Slurm.
",38,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2844,Fry," Ew!
",5,13,1,13,Leela,Bender2845,Bender," I'll save us!  Oh, that feels good!
",37,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2846,Fry," Thanks, Bender!
",17,13,1,13,Bender,Leela2847,Leela,"  The exit! We made it.
",24,13,1,13,Fry,Bender2848,Bender," Uh, Your Majesty, I brought the prisoners.
",44,13,1,13,Leela,Glurmo2849,Glurmo," Well, my curious friends, you learned the secret of Slurm. That concludes the portion of the tour where you stay alive.
",121,13,1,13,Bender,Leela2850,Leela," You wish, you slimy worm! Hi-yah!
",35,13,1,13,Glurmo,Slurm Queen2851,Slurm Queen," Good work, Glurmo. You have pleased your queen.
",49,13,1,13,Leela,Small Glurmo #22852,Small Glurmo #2," Thank you, Your Majesty.
",26,13,1,13,Slurm Queen,Small Glurmo #12853,Small Glurmo #1," Thanks, ma'am.
",16,13,1,13,Small Glurmo #2,Leela2854,Leela," How can you trick people into drinking something that comes out of your behind? It's disgusting.
",98,13,1,13,Small Glurmo #1,Slurm Queen2855,Slurm Queen," Is it? Honey comes from a bee's behind. Milk comes from a cow's behind. And have you ever used toothpaste?
",108,13,1,13,Leela,Fry2856,Fry," Whose behind does that come from?
",35,13,1,13,Slurm Queen,Slurm Queen2857,Slurm Queen," You don't wanna know.
",23,13,1,13,Fry,Bender2858,Bender," Look, we just came to party with Slurms MacKenzie. By the way, when is that scheduled?
",88,13,1,13,Slurm Queen,Slurm Queen2859,Slurm Queen,"  Never!  To the torture cave!
",31,13,1,13,Bender,Slurm Queen2860,Slurm Queen," You, my metal friend, will have the honour of becoming 174 Slurm cans.
",72,13,1,13,Slurm Queen,Bender2861,Bender," Ah, this trip is turning into a big letdown.
",46,13,1,13,Slurm Queen,Slurm Queen2862,Slurm Queen," As for you, you will be submerged in Royal Slurm which, in a matter of minutes, will transform you into a Slurm Queen like myself.
",132,13,1,13,Bender,Small Glurmo #12863,Small Glurmo #1," But, Your Highness, she's a commoner. Her Slurm will taste foul.
",66,13,1,13,Slurm Queen,Slurm Queen2864,Slurm Queen," Yes! Which is why we'll market it as New Slurm. Then, when everyone hates it, we'll bring back Slurm Classic, and make billions!
",130,13,1,13,Small Glurmo #1,Fry2865,Fry," What about me?
",16,13,1,13,Slurm Queen,Slurm Queen2866,Slurm Queen," You are free to go.
",21,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2867,Fry," Yes!
",6,13,1,13,Slurm Queen,Slurm Queen2868,Slurm Queen," If you can resist this concentrated super Slurm!  It's so delicious, you'll eat until you explode! Oh, which reminds me, put a tarp over that sofa, will you? Bon appÃ©tit!
",172,13,1,13,Fry,Fry2869,Fry," Mmm!
",6,13,1,13,Slurm Queen,Slurm Queen2870,Slurm Queen," Farewell! Oh, and congratulations again on winning the contest.
",65,13,1,13,Fry,Leela2871,Leela," Fry, untie us, quick!
",23,13,1,13,Slurm Queen,Fry2872,Fry," Here I come.  Let me just-- One more taste.
",45,13,1,13,Leela,Leela2873,Leela," You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and save us.
",47,13,1,13,Fry,Bender2874,Bender," I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?
",45,13,1,13,Leela,Leela2875,Leela," Yeah, we're boned.
",20,13,1,13,Bender,Fry2876,Fry," I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. But I'm not gonna let you die.
",73,13,1,13,Leela,Leela2877,Leela," Hurry!
",8,13,1,13,Fry,Bender2878,Bender," What's happening?  Just in time!
",34,13,1,13,Leela,Fry2879,Fry,"  Nooo!   I could fit if I didn't have these damn arms!
",56,13,1,13,Bender,Leela2880,Leela," We're close to the exit. I can smell those filthy orange guys.
",64,13,1,13,Fry,Slurms2881,Slurms," Stop right there!
",19,13,1,13,Leela,Bender2882,Bender," Slurms MacKenzie?
",19,13,1,13,Slurms,Slurms2883,Slurms," Shh! I want you to take me with you.
",38,13,1,13,Bender,Fry2884,Fry," Say what?
",11,13,1,13,Slurms,Slurms2885,Slurms," I'm partied out. All I want is to stay home and rent videos and watch them with a few friends. Is that so much to ask?
",120,13,1,13,Fry,Bender2886,Bender," Forget it, pal.  It says on this bottle-cap you have to party with us.
",72,13,1,13,Slurms,Slurms2887,Slurms," Alright, when we get to Earth. But please don't invite too many people, I wanna keep it small.
",96,13,1,13,Bender,Bender2888,Bender," No can do, Slurms!
",20,13,1,13,Slurms,Slurms2889,Slurms," This way!
",11,13,1,13,Bender,Leela2890,Leela," She's gaining on us.
",22,13,1,13,Slurms,Slurms2891,Slurms," Go on without me, I'll hold her off.
",38,13,1,13,Leela,Fry2892,Fry," But she'll crush you like a worm ... crushing a smaller worm.
",63,13,1,13,Slurms,Slurms2893,Slurms," It's alright. I'm so tired of partying. So very tired.  I'll save you the only way I know how: By partying!  Babes.
",117,13,1,13,Fry,Dixie2894,Dixie," Yes, Mr. MacKenzie?
",21,13,1,13,Slurms,Slurms2895,Slurms," You've served me well these 40 years, but this time I've got to party alone.
",78,13,1,13,Dixie,Trixie2896,Trixie," But--
",7,13,1,13,Slurms,Slurms2897,Slurms," There'll be other parties for you. Now go. Go!
",48,13,1,13,Trixie,Bender2898,Bender," Party on, Slurms!
",19,13,1,13,Slurms,Slurms2899,Slurms," Party on, contest winners. Party on.
",38,13,1,13,Bender,Slurm Queen2900,Slurm Queen," No! We're ruined! They know our disgusting secret!
",52,13,1,13,Slurms,Farnsworth2901,Farnsworth," Commissioner, my crew has made a horrific discovery: It seems that Slurm is produced in a colossal worm hiney!
",112,13,1,13,Slurm Queen,Commissioner2902,Commissioner,"  Hmm, ""hiney"", you say? Why, with your testimony we'll finally be able to outlaw this insidious Slurm.
",104,13,1,13,Farnsworth,Fry2903,Fry," Outlaw Slurm?  Uh, don't pay any attention to him, sir...
",59,13,1,13,Commissioner,Fry2904,Fry,"  Grandpa's making up crazy stories again.
",43,13,1,13,Fry,Farnsworth2905,Farnsworth,"  I'm not your grandpa, you're my uncle! From the year 2000!
",61,13,1,13,Fry,Commissioner2906,Commissioner,"  OK, grandpa, we'll take care of the ""bad worms"", don't you worry.
",68,13,1,13,Farnsworth,Fry2907,Fry," Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were here to enjoy this with me.
",67,13,1,13,Commissioner,Bender2908,Bender," Yeah, that Slurms sure loved to party. Whattya say we all party one last time for him?
",88,13,1,13,Fry,Leela2909,Leela," For Slurms!
",13,13,1,13,Bender,Amy2910,Amy,"  For Slurms!
",14,13,1,13,Leela,Bender2911,Bender,"  For Slurms!
",14,13,1,13,Amy,Farnsworth2912,Farnsworth,"  For Slurms!
",14,13,1,13,Bender,Fry2913,Fry,"  For Slurms!
",14,13,1,13,Farnsworth,Zoidberg2914,Zoidberg,"  Whammy-wazzle!
",17,13,1,13,Fry,Bender2915,Bender," Hey, that's not that bad.
",27,13,1,13,Zoidberg,Fry2916,Fry," Mmm!
",6,13,1,13,Bender,Announcer #12917,Announcer #1,"  Futurama is brought to you by ...  ... Glagnar's Human Rinds. It's a buncha muncha cruncha human!
",100,14,2,1,Fry,Leela2918,Leela," Aww! Somebody likes snouts.
",29,14,2,1,Announcer #1,Fry2919,Fry," Is it me?
",11,14,2,1,Leela,Bender2920,Bender,"  Ow, my head! My precious head!   Stupid can opener. You killed my father and now you've come back for me!
",108,14,2,1,Fry,Fry2921,Fry," You alright, Bender?
",22,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2922,Bender," Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why we keep this ticking time-bomb around just for that dumb animal.
",104,14,2,1,Fry,Leela2923,Leela," Don't yell at Nibbler like that.  You hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him and make up.
",88,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2924,Bender,"  No.
",6,14,2,1,Leela,Leela2925,Leela," I said pet him.
",17,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2926,Bender," I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both hands!  Ow! My ass! Get off!
",67,14,2,1,Leela,Leela2927,Leela," Are you alright?
",18,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2928,Bender," Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure.
",40,14,2,1,Leela,Leela2929,Leela," Not you.  Aww, poor baby chipped a fang.
",42,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2930,Bender," Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't see anyone kissing it.
",62,14,2,1,Leela,Zoidberg2931,Zoidberg,"  Alright, I'm coming.
",23,14,2,1,Bender,Jeffery2932,Jeffery," Remember, Rover gets the pill and Pepper gets the suppository.  Next.
",71,14,2,1,Zoidberg,Jeffery2933,Jeffery," It's just a simple broken fang, nothing serious.
",50,14,2,1,Jeffery,Bender2934,Bender," What's that you say there, doctor? You're gonna have to put him down?
",71,14,2,1,Jeffery,Jeffery2935,Jeffery," No-- What? Huh?
",17,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2936,Bender," Terrible shame that. Shall I do the honours?
",46,14,2,1,Jeffery,Leela2937,Leela," No!
",5,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2938,Bender," You about done?
",17,14,2,1,Leela,Leela2939,Leela," Next time I'm keeping it.
",27,14,2,1,Bender,Jeffery2940,Jeffery," OK, well I believe I have a replacement fang for your pet in the next room.  The jaguar didn't wanna cooperate but luckily he knocked one of my teeth out.  Now then.
",167,14,2,1,Leela,Fry2941,Fry," Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?
",46,14,2,1,Jeffery,Jeffery2942,Jeffery," Um, I'm still a little woozy from a gazelle kick this morning but if he's anything like the common tree, the rings might indicate his age.
",140,14,2,1,Fry,Fry2943,Fry," Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings.
",80,14,2,1,Jeffery,Jeffery2944,Jeffery," He's five.
",12,14,2,1,Fry,Farnsworth2945,Farnsworth," Happy birthday, young Nibbler.
",32,14,2,1,Jeffery,Leela2946,Leela," Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!
",48,14,2,1,Farnsworth,Bender2947,Bender,"  I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape.
",51,14,2,1,Leela,Fry2948,Fry," Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?
",48,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2949,Bender," Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am.  And the crowd goes wild! What prize do I get? Cash?
",93,14,2,1,Fry,Amy2950,Amy," Hey, look at Nibbler!
",23,14,2,1,Bender,Hermes2951,Hermes," Aww, he's holding a spoon.
",28,14,2,1,Amy,Zoidberg2952,Zoidberg," He's so talented!
",19,14,2,1,Hermes,Bender2953,Bender," You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime.  Ta-da!
",97,14,2,1,Zoidberg,Hermes2954,Hermes," Now he's wearing a hat!
",25,14,2,1,Bender,Leela2955,Leela," Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!
",41,14,2,1,Hermes,All2956,All,"  What day is today?
It's Nibbler's birthday,
What a day for a birthday,
Let's all have some cake.
",99,14,2,1,Leela,Fry2957,Fry,"  And you smell like one too!
",30,14,2,1,All,Bender2958,Bender," Hey, what about this?
",23,14,2,1,Fry,Leela2959,Leela," Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party.
",67,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2960,Bender," Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler.
",35,14,2,1,Leela,Leela2961,Leela," Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it.
",124,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2962,Bender," So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget.
",75,14,2,1,Leela,Bender2963,Bender," That'll take care of those annoying rats.  Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me.
",128,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2964,Bender," There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public.  No! Get away from there!  That's it.
",175,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2965,Bender," Happy birthday!
",17,14,2,1,Bender,Leela2966,Leela," Bender, what's going--   No!
",30,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2967,Bender," Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?
",42,14,2,1,Leela,Amy2968,Amy," Bender! How could you flush Nibbler down the toilet?
",54,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2969,Bender," Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?
",95,14,2,1,Amy,Leela2970,Leela,"  Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?
",80,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2971,Bender," Only one way to find out.
",27,14,2,1,Leela,Leela2972,Leela,"  You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.
",51,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2973,Bender," Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.
",49,14,2,1,Leela,Leela2974,Leela," You do?
",9,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2975,Bender," Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants, lady.
",95,14,2,1,Leela,Farnsworth2976,Farnsworth," And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I too hope one day to go: The toilet.
",118,14,2,1,Bender,Leela2977,Leela,"  I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he caused me.
",74,14,2,1,Farnsworth,Calculon2978,Calculon,"  Give it to me straight, doctor, don't sugarcoat it.
",54,14,2,1,Leela,Doctorbot2979,Doctorbot,"  Very well. Your entire family died when a plane piloted by your fiancÃ©e crashed into your uninsured home. And you have inoperable cancer.
",140,14,2,1,Calculon,Bender2980,Bender," Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!
",47,14,2,1,Doctorbot,Amy2981,Amy," It's like he doesn't understand simple humanoid emotion.
",58,14,2,1,Bender,Leela2982,Leela," I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel.
",57,14,2,1,Amy,Farnsworth2983,Farnsworth," Actually, through the miracle of science, that can be arranged.
",65,14,2,1,Leela,Fry2984,Fry," Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line Man was not meant to cross?
",98,14,2,1,Farnsworth,Linda2985,Linda,"  The official death toll in that tragic rocket crash has now been raised to 54,000.
",85,14,2,1,Fry,Bender2986,Bender," Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?
",48,14,2,1,Linda,Farnsworth2987,Farnsworth," I need to tinker in it.
",25,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2988,Bender," Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
",49,14,2,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2989,Farnsworth," Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy chip.
",45,14,2,1,Bender,Fry2990,Fry," And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?
",59,14,2,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2991,Farnsworth," Yes. If by ""allow"" you mean ""force"".
",38,14,2,1,Fry,Bender2992,Bender," Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow...
",46,14,2,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2993,Farnsworth,"  Oh, dear. Oh, my. I got it. Once more.
",41,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2994,Bender," Ow! Professor!
",16,14,2,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2995,Farnsworth,"  Steady now.
",14,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2996,Bender," Ow!
",5,14,2,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth2997,Farnsworth," There we go.  Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency.
",71,14,2,1,Bender,Bender2998,Bender," My God! I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads.
",127,14,2,1,Farnsworth,Zoidberg2999,Zoidberg," That's me, baby!
",18,14,2,1,Bender,Farnsworth3000,Farnsworth," Hmm.
",6,14,2,1,Zoidberg,Bender3001,Bender," Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her.
",111,14,2,1,Farnsworth,Amy3002,Amy," Uh ... that's me.
",19,14,2,1,Bender,Fry3003,Fry,"  Thanks for covering.
",23,14,2,1,Amy,Bender3004,Bender," This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.
",64,14,2,1,Fry,Amy3005,Amy," Bingo!
",8,14,2,1,Bender,Hermes3006,Hermes," That's Leela!
",15,14,2,1,Amy,Leela3007,Leela," Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain.
",71,14,2,1,Hermes,Bender3008,Bender," Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self.
",73,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3009,Leela," I'm not mopey. You shut up!
",29,14,2,1,Bender,Bender3010,Bender," Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet!
",81,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3011,Leela," Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel slightly less miserable already.
",72,14,2,1,Bender,Amy3012,Amy," Hey, you know what'd cheer you up? You should get a puppy.
",60,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3013,Leela," A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.
",40,14,2,1,Amy,Fry3014,Fry," What's your problem?
",22,14,2,1,Leela,Bender3015,Bender,"  I miss Nibbler.
",18,14,2,1,Fry,Fry3016,Fry," You do?
",9,14,2,1,Bender,Bender3017,Bender," Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings.  Why can't she just drink herself happy like a normal person?
",103,14,2,1,Fry,Bender3018,Bender," Uh-oh, jealousy.   You think you're so hot!
",45,14,2,1,Bender,Fry3019,Fry," What?
",7,14,2,1,Bender,Bender3020,Bender," The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
",73,14,2,1,Fry,Fry3021,Fry,"  They're just responding to my personality.
",45,14,2,1,Bender,Amy3022,Amy," Um, Leela? Armando and I are going to the back seat of his car for coffee. You gonna be alright here by yourself?
",115,14,2,1,Fry,Leela3023,Leela,"  Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You two go enjoy yourselves.
",72,14,2,1,Amy,Bender3024,Bender,"  I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream.   A bucket of--
",73,14,2,1,Leela,Fry3025,Fry,"  The spoon's in the foot powder.
",34,14,2,1,Bender,Bender3026,Bender," I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler.
",85,14,2,1,Fry,Fry3027,Fry," Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things, they stay alive in the sewers.
",101,14,2,1,Bender,Bender3028,Bender," Really?
",9,14,2,1,Fry,Fry3029,Fry," Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact.
",81,14,2,1,Bender,Bender3030,Bender," Hmm, sewers.  Thinking, thinking, thinking.
",45,14,2,1,Fry,Bender3031,Bender," Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you.  Damn, it's too small.  What did those human design this for anyway?  Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero!  See you on the other side!
",184,14,2,1,Bender,Fry3032,Fry," Bender? Bender?
",17,14,2,1,Bender,Fry3033,Fry," Have you seen my sombrero?
",28,14,2,1,Fry,Leela3034,Leela," Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?
",70,14,2,1,Fry,Fry3035,Fry," Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel bad.
",88,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3036,Leela," You're right. I feel terrible.
",32,14,2,1,Fry,Fry3037,Fry," Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!
",46,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3038,Leela," I guess we'd better go down into the sewers and look for him.
",63,14,2,1,Fry,Amy3039,Amy," Are you crazy? There's mutants down there! They'll eat you alive.
",67,14,2,1,Leela,Zoidberg3040,Zoidberg," They're hideous!
",18,14,2,1,Amy,Leela3041,Leela," There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.
",67,14,2,1,Zoidberg,Farnsworth3042,Farnsworth," Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate down there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive run-off and good old American faeces!
",175,14,2,1,Leela,Fry3043,Fry," God bless America.
",20,14,2,1,Farnsworth,Fry3044,Fry," Phew! Uh, ladies first.
",25,14,2,1,Fry,Fry3045,Fry," Oh, and the aftertaste!
",25,14,2,1,Fry,Leela3046,Leela," What is it?
",13,14,2,1,Fry,Fry3047,Fry," I burned my finger.
",21,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3048,Leela," OK, check the guidebook.
",26,14,2,1,Fry,Fry3049,Fry," Looks like we're under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think: All this was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met.
",120,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3050,Leela," Wait, what's that?
",20,14,2,1,Fry,Bender3051,Bender," I never should have thrown out the manual.
",44,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3052,Leela," Bender, you didn't have to come down here.
",44,14,2,1,Bender,Bender3053,Bender," I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much.
",44,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3054,Leela,"  He was so cute.
",18,14,2,1,Bender,Bender3055,Bender,"  He was so sweet.
",19,14,2,1,Leela,Fry3056,Fry," Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous.  Or maybe it's whatever that is.
",85,14,2,1,Bender,Leela3057,Leela,"  Nibbler?
",11,14,2,1,Fry,Bender3058,Bender,"  Nibbler?
",11,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3059,Leela," It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?
",53,14,2,1,Bender,Fry3060,Fry," Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe.  Don't worry. It gets wider after about a mile.
",120,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3061,Leela,"  Idiot.
",9,14,2,1,Fry,Bender3062,Bender,"  Idiot.
",9,14,2,1,Leela,Fry3063,Fry," OK, OK, never mind. I'll just ask those people for directions.
",64,14,2,1,Bender,Leela3064,Leela,"  Mutants!
",11,14,2,1,Fry,Leela3065,Leela," Mutants! They're real!
",24,14,2,1,Leela,Fry3066,Fry," I'll take care of this!  Back! Back!
",38,14,2,1,Leela,Vyolet3067,Vyolet," Thanks, handsome.
",19,14,2,1,Fry,Dwayne3068,Dwayne," Please, do not be frightened, we're harmless.
",47,14,2,1,Vyolet,Raoul3069,Raoul," I have three arms.
",20,14,2,1,Dwayne,Dwayne3070,Dwayne," I said ""harmless"" not ""armless"".
",34,14,2,1,Raoul,Vyolet3071,Vyolet," Lay off him. You know he's only got one ear.
",46,14,2,1,Dwayne,Fry3072,Fry," Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants.
",67,14,2,1,Vyolet,Dwayne3073,Dwayne," Mutants? Perhaps it is you who are the mutants.
",49,14,2,1,Fry,Vyolet3074,Vyolet," Please, Dwayne, have you looked in a mirror lately?
",53,14,2,1,Dwayne,Raoul3075,Raoul," Welcome to our village. It may not be Paris but it has a certain quaint charm that I, for one, wouldn't trade for the world.
",126,14,2,1,Vyolet,Bender3076,Bender," You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?
",46,14,2,1,Raoul,Dwayne3077,Dwayne," Perhaps. But perhaps your civilisation is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you.
",98,14,2,1,Bender,Leela3078,Leela," No, we're on the top.
",23,14,2,1,Dwayne,Fry3079,Fry," Daylight and everything.
",26,14,2,1,Leela,Vyolet3080,Vyolet," It must be wonderful.
",23,14,2,1,Fry,Bender3081,Bender," Eh.
",5,14,2,1,Vyolet,Leela3082,Leela," Listen. We actually came down here to find our pet, Nibbler. He got flushed down the toilet.
",94,14,2,1,Bender,Raoul3083,Raoul," Well if he got flushed down the toilet he probably came through here. Everything always does. Follow me.  All that is ours was once flushed down your toilets. Over there is our aquarium.  This is our library.
",210,14,2,1,Leela,Bender3084,Bender," Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
",42,14,2,1,Raoul,Raoul3085,Raoul," And over here is our church.
",30,14,2,1,Bender,Fry3086,Fry," Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?
",51,14,2,1,Raoul,Vyolet3087,Vyolet," Yeah, but nobody's that observant. It's mainly a Christmas and Easter thing.
",78,14,2,1,Fry,Leela3088,Leela,"  Nibbler?
",11,14,2,1,Vyolet,Bender3089,Bender,"  Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums.
",33,14,2,1,Leela,Fry3090,Fry," So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down here?
",75,14,2,1,Bender,Vyolet3091,Vyolet," No. That's just an urban legend.
",34,14,2,1,Fry,Bender3092,Bender,"  Then what are those?
",23,14,2,1,Vyolet,Vyolet3093,Vyolet," Crocodiles.
",13,14,2,1,Bender,Raoul3094,Raoul," We keep them as pets. Then, when they grow too large, we flush them down into the sub-sewer.
",94,14,2,1,Vyolet,Dwayne3095,Dwayne," Some say there's a freakish race of sub-mutants down there.
",61,14,2,1,Raoul,Vyolet3096,Vyolet," Please, that's just a sub-urban legend.
",41,14,2,1,Dwayne,Dwayne3097,Dwayne," Oh? Then I suppose you also don't believe in ...  ... El Chupanibre.
",70,14,2,1,Vyolet,Leela3098,Leela," El Chupanibre? What's that?
",29,14,2,1,Dwayne,Dwayne3099,Dwayne," Gather round, children, for the legend of El Chupanibre.
 He creeps and crawls in the midnight hush,
Silent as a low-flow toilet flush,
Watch your step,
'Cause sooner or later,
He'll eat you whole,
And half your alligator.
",224,14,2,1,Leela,Vyolet3100,Vyolet," Crocodile.
",12,14,2,1,Dwayne,Dwayne3101,Dwayne," Whatever.
",11,14,2,1,Vyolet,Leela3102,Leela," Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat. He must be El Chupanibre.
",98,14,2,1,Dwayne,Bender3103,Bender," Hey, yeah!
",12,14,2,1,Leela,Raoul3104,Raoul," You unleashed the dreaded El Chupanibre upon us? Then you are our sworn enemies.
",82,14,2,1,Bender,Leela3105,Leela," You don't understand. He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture him.
",80,14,2,1,Raoul,Dwayne3106,Dwayne," Impossible. If the legend is true, our only hope is to offer him a snack-rifice.
",82,14,2,1,Leela,Raoul3107,Raoul," Yes. An unspoiled virgin.
",27,14,2,1,Dwayne,Leela3108,Leela,"  I volunteer.
",15,14,2,1,Raoul,Vyolet3109,Vyolet," Nice try, Leela, but we've all seen Zapp Brannigan's webpage.
",63,14,2,1,Leela,Bender3110,Bender," Oh, I made myself feel bad.
",29,14,2,1,Vyolet,Raoul3111,Raoul," She'll have to do. Chain her to the post!  And rip her shirt a little.  Behold. When El Chupanibre comes for the, uh, ""virgin"", he will be snared by this rope trap.
",166,14,2,1,Bender,Dwayne3112,Dwayne,"  Shh. El Chupanibre comes soon. It is nightfall.
",50,14,2,1,Raoul,Leela3113,Leela," Nightfall? How can you tell down here?
",40,14,2,1,Dwayne,Dwayne3114,Dwayne," The tide is coming in.
",24,14,2,1,Leela,Vyolet3115,Vyolet," Quiet! The beast approaches.
",30,14,2,1,Dwayne,Bender3116,Bender," Nibbler! Aw, come here, precious!  Look, everyone, it's El Chupanibre.
",72,14,2,1,Vyolet,Dwayne3117,Dwayne," That's not El Chupanibre.
",27,14,2,1,Bender,Bender3118,Bender," Say what?
",11,14,2,1,Dwayne,Dwayne3119,Dwayne," That's El Chupanibre.
",23,14,2,1,Bender,Fry3120,Fry," I'll take care of this.
",25,14,2,1,Dwayne,Leela3121,Leela," Bender, do something.
",23,14,2,1,Fry,Bender3122,Bender," I'm too scared.
",17,14,2,1,Leela,Fry3123,Fry," Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!
",115,14,2,1,Bender,Leela3124,Leela," I can't. I love every living creature.
",40,14,2,1,Fry,Fry3125,Fry," Even me?
",10,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3126,Leela," As a friend.
",14,14,2,1,Fry,Fry3127,Fry," Damn.
",7,14,2,1,Leela,Bender3128,Bender," Listen to me, Leela: I'm an expert at not caring. The secret is to stop giving a rat's ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things that you want, that you deserve, that the world owes you.
",201,14,2,1,Fry,Leela3129,Leela," Well, I could use a new tank top.
",35,14,2,1,Bender,Bender3130,Bender," Bigger! Bigger!
",17,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3131,Leela," A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels.
",71,14,2,1,Bender,Bender3132,Bender," Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit.
",64,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3133,Leela," Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
",79,14,2,1,Bender,Bender3134,Bender," Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler.
",41,14,2,1,Leela,Fry3135,Fry," Bender's gonna be killed!
",27,14,2,1,Bender,Leela3136,Leela," You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.
",88,14,2,1,Fry,Fry3137,Fry,"  Yeah!
",8,14,2,1,Leela,Leela3138,Leela," You did it!
",13,14,2,1,Fry,Raoul3139,Raoul," Let's have a tissue-tape parade!
",34,14,2,1,Leela,Bender3140,Bender," No, thanks!
",13,14,2,1,Raoul,Dwayne3141,Dwayne," Gather round, children, to hear the legend of Bender.
 He came from above with a--
 It's gonna be many a year before someone flushes another guitar string.
",157,14,2,1,Bender,Farnsworth3142,Farnsworth," That was a disgusting story.
",30,14,2,1,Dwayne,Leela3143,Leela," And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender.
",52,14,2,1,Farnsworth,Bender3144,Bender," I love you too.  Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!
",71,14,2,1,Leela,Farnsworth3145,Farnsworth," Bender, you won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The emotion you felt for Nibbler was actually your own.
",122,14,2,1,Bender,Fry3146,Fry," Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other people's feelings afterall.
",98,14,2,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3147,Farnsworth," No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was running at triple capacity.
",65,14,2,1,Fry,Bender3148,Bender," And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!
",54,14,2,1,Farnsworth,Leela3149,Leela," You know, Bender may not have learned anything from me, but I think I actually learned something from him.   So long, jerkwads!
",129,14,2,1,Bender,Farnsworth3150,Farnsworth,"  So long!
",11,14,2,1,Leela,Fry3151,Fry," Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six.  Check.
",40,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Bender3152,Bender," Hmm. Get him, boys!
",21,15,2,2,Fry,Fry3153,Fry,"  Good move.
",13,15,2,2,Bender,Farnsworth3154,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone.  We have a mission to further the noble cause of intergalactic peace.
",92,15,2,2,Fry,Bender3155,Bender," Nope. Watching cartoons.
",26,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Fry3156,Fry," Sorry.
",8,15,2,2,Bender,Leela3157,Leela," What's the mission?
",21,15,2,2,Fry,Farnsworth3158,Farnsworth," It's a delivery for the Democratic Order Of Planets.
",54,15,2,2,Leela,Fry3159,Fry," DOOP? What's that?
",20,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3160,Farnsworth," It's similar to the United Nations from your time, Fry.
",57,15,2,2,Fry,Fry3161,Fry," Uh...
",7,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Hermes3162,Hermes," Or like the Federation from your Star Trek programme.
",55,15,2,2,Fry,Fry3163,Fry,"  Oh!
",6,15,2,2,Hermes,Farnsworth3164,Farnsworth," Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the DOOP's new headquarters.
",64,15,2,2,Fry,Leela3165,Leela," What are we delivering?
",25,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3166,Farnsworth," Something without which no ribbon-cutting ceremony could proceed. The ceremonial oversized scissors.
",102,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3167,Leela," We'll get them there as quickly as we can.
",44,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3168,Farnsworth," Alright, but don't run with them.
",35,15,2,2,Leela,Fry3169,Fry," Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind-blowing. Ooh, a reception table with muffins!
",111,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Glab3170,Glab," Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the DOOP's magnificent new headquarters. A fitting home for an organisation that has fostered peace throughout the universe. Even between the Insectoids and the Space Lizards.
",241,15,2,2,Fry,Fry3171,Fry," So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?
",40,15,2,2,Glab,Amazonian3172,Amazonian," Big rats there. Me crush with club.
",37,15,2,2,Fry,Fry3173,Fry," That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a coffee.
",77,15,2,2,Amazonian,Glab3174,Glab," I can think of no better place for this centre of diplomacy than here in orbit around the Neutral Planet.  What are your thoughts on this momentous occasion, Your Neutralness?
",177,15,2,2,Fry,Neutral President3175,Neutral President," I have no strong feelings one way or the other.
",49,15,2,2,Glab,Zapp3176,Zapp," I hate these filthy Neutrals, Kif. With enemies you know where they stand but with Neutrals, who knows? It sickens me.  Halt.  Why, Leela, I do believe we've met.
",164,15,2,2,Neutral President,Bender3177,Bender,"  He means you guys did it.
",28,15,2,2,Zapp,Leela3178,Leela," If you don't mind, we're here to deliver the scissors for the ribbon-cutting.
",79,15,2,2,Bender,Zapp3179,Zapp," Then you're under arrest.
",27,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3180,Leela," What for?
",11,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3181,Zapp," How do I know these scissors aren't part of some Neutral plot?
",64,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3182,Leela," But they're not even sharp. Who could I possibly hurt with them?
",66,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3183,Zapp," The Yarn People of Nylar 4?  So, a plan to assassinate a weird-looking alien with scissors. How very Neutral of you.
",118,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3184,Leela," What?
",7,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3185,Zapp," It was almost the perfect crime, but you forgot one thing: Rock crushes scissors ... but paper covers rock ... and scissors cut paper. Kif, we have a conundrum.  Search them for paper, and bring me a rock.
",207,15,2,2,Leela,Kif3186,Kif," Why?
",6,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3187,Zapp," So beautiful, yet so neutral.  Drag them to the ship.
",55,15,2,2,Kif,Glab3188,Glab," And now, to cut the ribbon, the legendary DOOP captain who just returned from a triumphant carpet-bombing of Eden 7, Zapp Brannigan.
",134,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3189,Zapp," What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?
",109,15,2,2,Glab,Kif3190,Kif," Um, sir, you're supposed to be cutting the ribbon right now.
",62,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3191,Zapp," No matter. I'll simply cut it from here with the ship's laser.
",64,15,2,2,Kif,Kif3192,Kif," Sir, I don't think that's wise.
",33,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3193,Zapp," Kif, if there's one thing I don't need it's your I-don't-think-that's-wise attitude.
",86,15,2,2,Kif,Zapp3194,Zapp," Whoopsie-daisy!
",17,15,2,2,Zapp,Glab3195,Glab," Zapp Brannigan, you stand accused of blowing up DOOP headquarters. How do you plead?
",86,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3196,Zapp," Absolutely 99% not guilty.
",28,15,2,2,Glab,Glab3197,Glab," Then the prosecutor will call his first witness.
",50,15,2,2,Zapp,Hyper-Chicken3198,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, I'm just a simple Hyper-Chicken from a backwoods asteroid but if it please the court I reckon I'll call the entire jury.
",135,15,2,2,Glab,Glab3199,Glab," I'm going to allow this.
",26,15,2,2,Hyper-Chicken,Hyper-Chicken3200,Hyper-Chicken," Members of the jury ...  ... did y'all happen to catch a gander at who blew up that there DOOP headquarters?
",110,15,2,2,Glab,Juror #13201,Juror #1,"  That's the guy, right there.
",31,15,2,2,Hyper-Chicken,Juror #23202,Juror #2,"  Oh, yeah, right there.
",25,15,2,2,Juror #1,Small Glurmo #13203,Small Glurmo #1,"  That one.
",12,15,2,2,Juror #2,Hyper-Chicken3204,Hyper-Chicken," And are y'all gonna vote to convict him?
",42,15,2,2,Small Glurmo #1,Neptunian3205,Neptunian,"  You'd better believe it.
",27,15,2,2,Hyper-Chicken,Juror #13206,Juror #1,"  You bet.
",11,15,2,2,Neptunian,Glab3207,Glab," The jury is instructed to disregard its own testimony.
",56,15,2,2,Juror #1,Hyper-Chicken3208,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, the prosecution rests.
",37,15,2,2,Glab,Glab3209,Glab," The evidence against Zapp Brannigan is strong. However, in light of his years of service, and the incompetence of this hillbilly prosecutor, I'm afraid I must dismiss all charges.
",181,15,2,2,Hyper-Chicken,Leela3210,Leela," Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I know the case is closed and you've rendered your verdict, but I wanna testify.
",116,15,2,2,Glab,Glab3211,Glab," I'm going to allow this.
",26,15,2,2,Leela,Hyper-Chicken3212,Hyper-Chicken," Now, Miss Leela, on the date in question, were you or were you not wearing a hoop skirt?
",90,15,2,2,Glab,Leela3213,Leela," That's a stupid question. What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye.
",161,15,2,2,Hyper-Chicken,Zapp3214,Zapp," I'd like to cross-examine the witness.
",40,15,2,2,Leela,Glab3215,Glab," I'm going to allow this.
",26,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3216,Zapp," We've met before have we not?
",31,15,2,2,Glab,Leela3217,Leela,"  Yes.
",7,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3218,Zapp," And on that occasion, did you have sex with someone? May I remind you you are still under oath.
",97,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3219,Leela,"  Yes.
",7,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3220,Zapp," Please point out the person in this courtroom you had sex with.  And his name is?
",83,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3221,Leela," Zapp Brannigan.
",17,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3222,Zapp," The very same Zapp Brannigan who did not blow up DOOP headquarters. I rest my case.
",85,15,2,2,Leela,Glab3223,Glab," Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may begin your deliberations.
",69,15,2,2,Zapp,Small Glurmo #13224,Small Glurmo #1," Your Honour, we have reached a verdict. We find the defendant ... guilty.
",75,15,2,2,Glab,Glab3225,Glab," Zapp Brannigan, you are hereby stripped of your rank as captain and dismissed from the DOOP.
",94,15,2,2,Small Glurmo #1,Zapp3226,Zapp," I'd like to make one final statement. Kif, c'mere and hold up the flag.  And wave it a little, for God's sakes. My friends, you can take away a man's title and his uniform but you can never take away his integrity or his honour. Plus it was mostly Kif's fault.
",262,15,2,2,Glab,Kif3227,Kif," What?
",7,15,2,2,Zapp,Glab3228,Glab," Kif Kroker, you are also stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged.
",78,15,2,2,Kif,Zapp3229,Zapp," One day a man has everything, the next day he blows up a $400 billion space station and the next day he has nothing. It makes you think.
",138,15,2,2,Glab,Kif3230,Kif," No, it doesn't.
",17,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3231,Zapp," Come, Kif, it's time to begin our life as civilians.  That's an order, soldier.
",81,15,2,2,Kif,Fry3232,Fry," Hey, Bender?
",14,15,2,2,Zapp,Bender3233,Bender," Yeah?
",7,15,2,2,Fry,Leela3234,Leela," Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second one using actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship like I ordered you to.
",176,15,2,2,Bender,Fry3235,Fry," You don't have to get so mad, Leela.
",38,15,2,2,Leela,Bender3236,Bender," Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger.
",63,15,2,2,Fry,Leela3237,Leela," Zapp?
",7,15,2,2,Bender,Zapp3238,Zapp," Leela, I didn't know where else to turn. You're the only woman who ever loved me.
",83,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3239,Leela," I never loved you.
",20,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3240,Zapp," I mean physically.
",20,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3241,Leela," What do you want?
",19,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3242,Zapp," Just let me work for a little food. Perhaps I could paint a fence, or service you sexually, or mop the floors.
",112,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3243,Leela," You don't know how to do any of those things.
",47,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3244,Zapp," Kif might.
",12,15,2,2,Leela,Farnsworth3245,Farnsworth," Leela, who are you talking to?
",32,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3246,Zapp," Just a broken-down hobo who's hit rock-bottom. And his commanding officer.
",76,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3247,Farnsworth," Why, you're that disgraced starship captain.  Having him on staff will distract people from our horrendous safety record.  Come in.
",133,15,2,2,Zapp,Farnsworth3248,Farnsworth," I'd like everyone to meet our new employees.   Which ones are new?
",68,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Hermes3249,Hermes," The green dude and the fat man.
",33,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3250,Farnsworth," Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either.
",62,15,2,2,Hermes,Bender3251,Bender," I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.
",43,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3252,Farnsworth," Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course.  Anyway, whoever you all are, I have good news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high gravity you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy!
",236,15,2,2,Bender,Zapp3253,Zapp," So, this Leela. I know she's a very sensuous woman but what manner of captain is she?
",87,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Fry3254,Fry," She's really strict.
",22,15,2,2,Zapp,Bender3255,Bender," And mean.
",11,15,2,2,Fry,Zapp3256,Zapp," I see. Does she by any chance give the crewmembers spankings?
",63,15,2,2,Bender,Fry3257,Fry," No, she just makes us do work and stuff.
",42,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3258,Zapp," Good, good. But should she ever institute some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy, let me go in your place. I won't have my comrades harmed.
",143,15,2,2,Fry,Bender3259,Bender," Hey, this guy's alright!
",26,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3260,Zapp," Here's to us poor schmoes working for the man. Even if he is a hot, sexy, female man.
",87,15,2,2,Bender,Kif3261,Kif," I've computed out landing co-ordinates, Captain.
",50,15,2,2,Zapp,Leela3262,Leela," Thanks, Kif. Very nice work.
",30,15,2,2,Kif,Kif3263,Kif," Wait, what?
",13,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3264,Leela," I said ""very nice work"".
",26,15,2,2,Kif,Kif3265,Kif," This is the happiest day of my life.
",38,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3266,Leela," OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel.
",78,15,2,2,Kif,Bender3267,Bender," They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.
",63,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3268,Leela," They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense.
",132,15,2,2,Bender,Fry3269,Fry," Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me.
",47,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3270,Leela," I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time.
",88,15,2,2,Fry,Bender3271,Bender," Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once.
",61,15,2,2,Leela,Fry3272,Fry," Yeah!
",7,15,2,2,Bender,Zapp3273,Zapp," That's using the old noodle!
",30,15,2,2,Fry,Zapp3274,Zapp," Come on, girdle. Hold!
",24,15,2,2,Zapp,Bender3275,Bender," Uh-oh.
",8,15,2,2,Zapp,Leela3276,Leela," What the hell happened?
",25,15,2,2,Bender,Bender3277,Bender," Some breaking occurred, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know.
",75,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3278,Leela," I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here.
",84,15,2,2,Bender,Fry3279,Fry," Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly.
",78,15,2,2,Leela,Bender3280,Bender," I'll start loading up the pillows.
",36,15,2,2,Fry,Leela3281,Leela," No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows by hand.
",90,15,2,2,Bender,Zapp3282,Zapp," Let me ask you a serious question, Leela: Does the company that made your bra make a girdle as well? I ask because a friend of mine...
",136,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3283,Leela," Just get to work.
",19,15,2,2,Zapp,Bender3284,Bender,"  I'm Leela, get to work, neh, neh, neh.
",41,15,2,2,Leela,Fry3285,Fry," I agree.
",10,15,2,2,Bender,Kif3286,Kif," The point is, it's just so humiliating working for that man. Once, he actually ordered me to ... shave his armpits while he was in the bathtub. So, I said--
",158,15,2,2,Fry,Leela3287,Leela," Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?
",69,15,2,2,Kif,Kif3288,Kif," Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout then, um... OK, well, there he was in the tub, alright?
",96,15,2,2,Leela,Fry3289,Fry," Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off.
",59,15,2,2,Kif,Bender3290,Bender," This is all Leela's fault.
",28,15,2,2,Fry,Fry3291,Fry," Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now.
",104,15,2,2,Bender,Zapp3292,Zapp," Y'know, boys, a good captain needs many skills, such as boldness, daring and a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced Leela has any of those things.
",149,15,2,2,Fry,Fry3293,Fry," Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much.
",72,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3294,Zapp," Back when I was captain all I asked from my men was their complete loyalty. If I had that, then for all I cared they could sit around the whole day drinking beer in their underpants.
",184,15,2,2,Fry,Bender3295,Bender," Beer?
",7,15,2,2,Zapp,Fry3296,Fry," Underpants?
",13,15,2,2,Bender,Kif3297,Kif," But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. I'm free!  Oh, you hear that? I'm actually laughing!
",91,15,2,2,Fry,Fry3298,Fry," This is a mutiny.
",19,15,2,2,Kif,Bender3299,Bender," You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain.
",50,15,2,2,Fry,Fry3300,Fry," All hail the new captain.
",27,15,2,2,Bender,Zapp3301,Zapp," Leela, you might be a formidable do-er of the nasty but I am forced to relieve you of your post.
",98,15,2,2,Fry,Leela3302,Leela," On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?

",53,15,2,2,Leela,Fry3304,Fry," We don't have a brig.
",23,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3305,Zapp," Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as ""the brig"".
",88,15,2,2,Fry,Leela3306,Leela," You really don't want me to be captain anymore?
",49,15,2,2,Zapp,Bender3307,Bender," You got it, genius.
",21,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3308,Leela," But, didn't I do a good job?
",30,15,2,2,Bender,Fry3309,Fry," You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.
",64,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3310,Leela," Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends.
",85,15,2,2,Fry,Fry3311,Fry," Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then.
",63,15,2,2,Leela,Bender3312,Bender," Don't worry, Leela. Soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh.
",72,15,2,2,Fry,Zapp3313,Zapp," Back in my old uniform, and it nearly still fits. Even after all that fattening hobo cuisine.
",95,15,2,2,Bender,Kif3314,Kif," What shall I do with your civilian clothes, sir?
",50,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3315,Zapp," Take them to the laundry-brig.  So, do I have your loyalty, men?
",66,15,2,2,Kif,Bender3316,Bender,"  To the ends of the universe.
",31,15,2,2,Zapp,Fry3317,Fry," Ten hundred percent!
",22,15,2,2,Bender,Zapp3318,Zapp," That's not nearly loyal enough. I order you to sit around and drink beer until you're as loyal as Kif here.
",109,15,2,2,Fry,Bender3319,Bender," Yes, sir, sir!
",16,15,2,2,Zapp,Kif3320,Kif," Um, may I have a beer, sir?
",29,15,2,2,Bender,Zapp3321,Zapp," No. You're loyal enough already. Meanwhile, I have a plan. We will single-handedly attack our archenemy the Neutral Planet.
",125,15,2,2,Kif,Kif3322,Kif," Oh, jeez.
",11,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3323,Zapp," Once the neutral war machine lies in ruins, I'll be a hero again and the DOOP will reinstate me as captain.
",109,15,2,2,Kif,Kif3324,Kif," But, sir, that plan makes no sense.
",37,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3325,Zapp," Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall correctly, you were court-martialled in disgrace.
",90,15,2,2,Kif,Fry3326,Fry," Ooh, burn!
",12,15,2,2,Zapp,Bender3327,Bender," Nailed you, buddy!
",20,15,2,2,Fry,Zapp3328,Zapp," Prepare to continue the epic struggle between good and neutral.
",65,15,2,2,Bender,Fry3329,Fry," This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ...  ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like...
",148,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3330,Zapp," Precisely. Now, in the name of all that is good and honourable, we'll call the Neutral President with a message of peace, then blast him.
",139,15,2,2,Fry,Bender3331,Bender,"  Yes, sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!
",31,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3332,Zapp," Fly the white flag of war.
",28,15,2,2,Bender,Zapp3333,Zapp,"  This is Zapp Brannigan of the good ship ... Planet Express Ship. I come swinging the olive branch of peace.
",110,15,2,2,Zapp,Neutral Presidents Aide3334,Neutral Presidents Aide," Should we trust him, Your Neutralness?
",40,15,2,2,Zapp,Neutral President3335,Neutral President," All I know is my gut says maybe.
",34,15,2,2,Neutral Presidents Aide,Bender3336,Bender," What now, chief?
",18,15,2,2,Neutral President,Zapp3337,Zapp," Now we crash the ship into their headquarters, killing them in a hellish firestorm from which no living thing can escape.
",123,15,2,2,Bender,Fry3338,Fry," Good, good, then what?
",24,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3339,Zapp," Then your mission is complete. I, meanwhile, will have ejected to safety, wearing the only spacesuit on board.
",112,15,2,2,Fry,Fry3340,Fry," Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?
",44,15,2,2,Zapp,Zapp3341,Zapp," Of course. What do you think I meant by ""loyalty""? Now help me into the only spacesuit. It looks a bit sweaty in there so you may need to apply baby powder.
",158,15,2,2,Fry,Fry3342,Fry," Leela, we want you to be captain again.
",41,15,2,2,Zapp,Leela3343,Leela," Let me guess. He cancelled naptime?  He ran out of beer?  So he's about to kill us?
",85,15,2,2,Fry,Fry3344,Fry," We want Leela to be captain again.
",36,15,2,2,Leela,Zapp3345,Zapp," So it's mutiny, is it? I never thought I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's eject. I found a children's spacesuit you can wear.
",126,15,2,2,Fry,Kif3346,Kif," To be honest, sir, I'd rather stay here with Captain Leela. She actually listens to what I have to--
",102,15,2,2,Zapp,Leela3347,Leela," Oh, no! He's disabled the steering.  We're gonna crash!
",57,15,2,2,Kif,Bender3348,Bender," Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo.  And Fry.
",69,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3349,Leela," OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?
",74,15,2,2,Bender,Fry3350,Fry," Absolutely.
",13,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3351,Leela," Even if I make you work hard?
",31,15,2,2,Fry,Bender3352,Bender," As your God is my witness.
",28,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3353,Leela," Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine.
",97,15,2,2,Bender,Bender3354,Bender," Oh, man, that crap's heavy.
",29,15,2,2,Leela,Fry3355,Fry," And warm.
",11,15,2,2,Bender,Leela3356,Leela," Just do it.
",13,15,2,2,Fry,Neutral Presidents Aide3357,Neutral Presidents Aide," Your Neutralness, it's a beige alert.
",39,15,2,2,Leela,Neutral President3358,Neutral President," If I don't survive, tell my wife, ""Hello"".
",44,15,2,2,Neutral Presidents Aide,Leela3359,Leela," Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.
",44,15,2,2,Neutral President,Bender3360,Bender,"  Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it.
",63,15,2,2,Leela,Fry3361,Fry," It's too low.
",15,15,2,2,Bender,Bender3362,Bender," Quick.
",8,15,2,2,Fry,Leela3363,Leela," You did it! You actually did it!
",34,15,2,2,Bender,Fry3364,Fry," And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.
",55,15,2,2,Leela,Zapp3365,Zapp," And so, when Captain Leela panicked, perhaps distracted by female troubles, my quick thinking allowed me to do whatever I did to save the day.
",144,15,2,2,Fry,Glab3366,Glab," Captain Leela, is this rambling story of magic and heroism true?
",66,15,2,2,Zapp,Leela3367,Leela," Well, actually--
",18,15,2,2,Glab,Farnsworth3368,Farnsworth,"  That a girl! If they don't take him back we can keep him as captain.
",71,15,2,2,Leela,Leela3369,Leela," Your Honour, it's all true: My female incompetence, Zapp's cat-like reflexes, the stuff that made no sense, all of it.
",120,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Glab3370,Glab," In that case, Zapp Brannigan, I hereby restore your rank and parking privileges.
",82,15,2,2,Leela,Farnsworth3371,Farnsworth," Oh, foo!
",10,15,2,2,Glab,Zapp3372,Zapp," Come, Kif, we've got work to do.
",34,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Kif3373,Kif," I-I'll call and tell you about it.
",36,15,2,2,Zapp,Fry3374,Fry," Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever.
",92,15,2,2,Kif,Bender3375,Bender," Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?
",57,15,2,2,Fry,Leela3376,Leela," No.
",5,15,2,2,Bender,Fry3377,Fry," Please?
",9,15,2,2,Leela,Bender3378,Bender," Come on, Captain.
",19,15,2,2,Fry,Leela3379,Leela," Oh, alright.
",14,15,2,2,Bender,Farnsworth3380,Farnsworth," No time off.
",14,15,2,2,Leela,Fry3381,Fry," Aw, man.
",10,15,2,2,Farnsworth,Leela3382,Leela," Let's mutiny!
",15,15,2,2,Fry,Narrator3383,Narrator,"  You're entering the vicinity of an area adjacent to a location.  The kind of place where there might be a monster or some kind of weird mirror.  These are just examples. It could also be something much better.  Prepare to enter The Scary Door.  As per your request, please find enclosed the last man on earth.
",312,16,2,3,Leela,Man #13384,Man #1,"  Finally, solitude. I can read books for all eternity.  It's not fair! It's not fair! Wait, my eyes aren't that bad. I can still read the large print books.  It's not f-- Well, lucky I know how to read Braille!  Hey, look at that weird mirror!
",245,16,2,3,Narrator,Bender3385,Bender," Cursed by his own hubris!

",44,16,2,3,Bender,Leela3389,Leela," Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these two men will become president of the world.
",118,16,2,3,Announcer #1,Fry3390,Fry," What do we care? We live in the United States.
",48,16,2,3,Leela,Leela3391,Leela," The United States is part of the world.
",41,16,2,3,Fry,Fry3392,Fry," Wow! I have been gone a long time.
",36,16,2,3,Leela,Johnson3393,Johnson,"  It's time someone had the courage to stand up and say: ""I'm against those things that everybody hates"".
",106,16,2,3,Fry,Jackson3394,Jackson,"  Now I respect my opponent. I think he's a good man but, quite frankly, I agree with everything he just said!
",111,16,2,3,Johnson,Fry3395,Fry," These are the candidates? They sound like clones.  Wait a minute. They are clones!
",84,16,2,3,Jackson,Leela3396,Leela," Don't let their identical DNA fool you. They differ on some key issues.
",73,16,2,3,Fry,Johnson3397,Johnson,"  I say your three cent titanium tax goes too far.
",51,16,2,3,Leela,Jackson3398,Jackson,"  And I say your three cent titanium tax doesn't go too far enough!
",68,16,2,3,Johnson,Fry3399,Fry," If I were registered to vote, I'd send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown.
",125,16,2,3,Jackson,Leela3400,Leela," You're not registered?
",24,16,2,3,Fry,Fry3401,Fry," Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides, it's not like one vote ever made a difference.
",86,16,2,3,Leela,Leela3402,Leela," That's not true; the first robot president won by exactly one vote.
",69,16,2,3,Fry,Bender3403,Bender," Ah, yes, John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.
",117,16,2,3,Leela,Farnsworth3404,Farnsworth," But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.
",69,16,2,3,Bender,Leela3405,Leela," The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't, I'm still taking you to get registered.
",112,16,2,3,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3406,Farnsworth," Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all go register!
",52,16,2,3,Leela,Fry3407,Fry," Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?
",57,16,2,3,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3408,Farnsworth," The very instant I became old.
",32,16,2,3,Fry,Farnsworth3409,Farnsworth," The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate.
",104,16,2,3,Farnsworth,Fry3410,Fry," The less fortunate get all the breaks!
",40,16,2,3,Farnsworth,Zoidberg3411,Zoidberg," You know, Fry, you could join a third party, maybe.
",53,16,2,3,Fry,Amy3412,Amy," Only weirdos and mutants join third parties.
",46,16,2,3,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3413,Zoidberg," Really? I'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting.
",57,16,2,3,Amy,Fry3414,Fry," What party do you belong to, Bender?
",38,16,2,3,Zoidberg,Bender3415,Bender," I'm not allowed to vote.

",65,16,2,3,Bender,Fry3419,Fry," OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?
",80,16,2,3,Woman #1,Woman #13420,Woman #1," Attach Brain Slugs to them.
",29,16,2,3,Fry,Fry3421,Fry,"  Sure, you say that now!
",26,16,2,3,Woman #1,Amy3422,Amy," So, is it true you can make all kinds of shirts and ropes out of hemp?
",72,16,2,3,Fry,Stoned Guy3423,Stoned Guy," Dave's not here, man.
",23,16,2,3,Amy,Amy3424,Amy," I also heard hemp makes great shampoo.
",40,16,2,3,Stoned Guy,Stoned Guy3425,Stoned Guy," It does? No way! I gotta check out this brochure!
",51,16,2,3,Amy,Farnsworth3426,Farnsworth," So what are you doing to protect my constitutional right to bear doomsday devices?
",84,16,2,3,Stoned Guy,N.R.A. Man #13427,N.R.A. Man #1," Well, first off, we're gonna get rid of that three-day waiting period for mad scientists.
",91,16,2,3,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3428,Farnsworth," Damn straight! Today, the mad scientist can't get a doomsday device, tomorrow it's the mad grad student. Where will it end?
",125,16,2,3,N.R.A. Man #1,N.R.A. Man #13429,N.R.A. Man #1," Amen, brother. I don't go anywhere without my mutated anthrax ...  ... for duck hunting.
",90,16,2,3,Farnsworth,Zoidberg3430,Zoidberg," Sure, humans are cute, but how else are we supposed to test cosmetics?
",72,16,2,3,N.R.A. Man #1,Hermes3431,Hermes," I concur.
",11,16,2,3,Zoidberg,Fry3432,Fry," Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!
",57,16,2,3,Hermes,V.A.P. Man #13433,V.A.P. Man #1," Sorry, not with that attitude.
",32,16,2,3,Fry,Fry3434,Fry,"  OK then, screw it.
",21,16,2,3,V.A.P. Man #1,V.A.P. Man #13435,V.A.P. Man #1," Welcome aboard, brother!
",26,16,2,3,Fry,Fry3436,Fry,"  Alright!
",11,16,2,3,V.A.P. Man #1,V.A.P. Man #13437,V.A.P. Man #1," You're out.
",13,16,2,3,Fry,Fry3438,Fry," That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested in politics.
",84,16,2,3,V.A.P. Man #1,Linda3439,Linda,"  And so, with two weeks left in the campaign, the question on everyone's mind is who will be the next President of Earth? Jack Johnson or bitter rival John Jackson? Two terrific candidates, huh, Morbo?
",203,16,2,3,Fry,Morbo3440,Morbo,"  All humans are vermin in the eyes of Morbo.
",46,16,2,3,Linda,Linda3441,Linda,"  In other local news, disaster struck on Saturn's moon of Titan today, when a titanium mine collapsed, trapping 1,000 robot workers.

",24,16,2,3,Linda,Linda3443,Linda,"  Unless something is done quickly, the trapped robots will be dead within 300 years.  Sir, what rescue operations are planned?
",128,16,2,3,Bender,Mine Spokesman3444,Mine Spokesman,"  The plan is basically to pave over the area and get on with our lives.
",73,16,2,3,Linda,Morbo3445,Morbo,"  News of the mines closing sent titanium prices skyrocketing.

",36,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3454,Bender," Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves!  Hey, get away. Shoo! I'll give you five dollars to not do what you're thinking about doing.  You just lost five dollars!
",219,16,2,3,Pawnbroker,Bender3455,Bender," Hey, buddy. Little help?   Thank you!
",39,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3456,Bender," Hello, peasants.
",18,16,2,3,Bender,Leela3457,Leela," Bender? What happened to you?
",31,16,2,3,Bender,Fry3458,Fry," Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?
",50,16,2,3,Leela,Bender3459,Bender," No, I sold my body.
",21,16,2,3,Fry,Farnsworth3460,Farnsworth," Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewellery and skintight pants.
",186,16,2,3,Bender,Fry3461,Fry," This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?
",63,16,2,3,Farnsworth,Bender3462,Bender," Pft! Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it.
",104,16,2,3,Fry,Fry3463,Fry," Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark.
",53,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3464,Bender," Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?
",49,16,2,3,Fry,Bender3465,Bender," Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please.
",48,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3466,Bender," Shaken, not stirred.  Aw, yeah!
",33,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3467,Bender," Put it all on black.
",22,16,2,3,Bender,Croupier3468,Croupier," 21 red.  I beg your pardon. 33 black.
",39,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3469,Bender," Yes! The rich get richer!
",27,16,2,3,Croupier,Bender3470,Bender," Strike! In your face, Leela!  Ow!
",35,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3471,Bender,"  Timber!
",10,16,2,3,Bender,Fry3472,Fry," Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?
",45,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3473,Bender," Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!
",114,16,2,3,Fry,Fry3474,Fry," Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.
",45,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3475,Bender," I've had it up to here with this place. I'm off to the Head Museum to hang out with classy heads like me who appreciate the finer things: poetry, philosophy, hats. So long, coffin stuffers!  Uh, could one of you coffin stuffers please carry me?
",246,16,2,3,Fry,Bender3476,Bender," Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think, Fry? Fry?

",34,16,2,3,Bender,Fry3478,Fry," I recognise you. Didn't you use to have a body of some sort?
",62,16,2,3,Schiffer,Schiffer3479,Schiffer," Yeah, but it was holding me back. You know, I just did the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimcap Issue.
",107,16,2,3,Fry,Fry3480,Fry," Well, you're looking great.
",29,16,2,3,Schiffer,Schiffer3481,Schiffer," Thanks. I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds though.
",53,16,2,3,Fry,Fry3482,Fry,"  Couldn't hurt.

",80,16,2,3,Bender,Ford3485,Ford," I apologise for his rudeness, ma'am. He gets this way around meaty-looking women.
",83,16,2,3,Clinton,Fry3486,Fry,"  Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time. But voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine.
",133,16,2,3,Ford,Ford3487,Ford," Frankly, I've never felt voting to be all that essential to the process.
",74,16,2,3,Fry,Nixon3488,Nixon," No kidding, Ford.
",19,16,2,3,Ford,Bender3489,Bender," So then the hookerbot says, ""That's not my expansion slot"" and my friend says, ""That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!""
",126,16,2,3,Nixon,Washington3490,Washington," Oh, Bender. Thou robots really cracketh me up.
",48,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3491,Bender," You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?
",65,16,2,3,Washington,George H.W. Bush3492,George H.W. Bush," Sorry, Bender, but we just can't allow every Tom, Dick, and Harry to move in. No offence, Jefferson, Nixon and Truman.
",120,16,2,3,Bender,Carter3493,Carter," Maybe Mr. Bender can get a spot in the closet of presidential losers.
",71,16,2,3,George H.W. Bush,Dole3494,Dole," Bob Dole needs company. LaRouche won't stop with the ""knock knock"" jokes.
",75,16,2,3,Carter,Bender3495,Bender," Pass.
",7,16,2,3,Dole,Washington3496,Washington," So, telleth, Bender. What hath happened to your body?
",55,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3497,Bender," I hocked it.
",14,16,2,3,Washington,Washington3498,Washington," Hocked it? Why wouldst thou do that?
",38,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3499,Bender," Same reason you hocked your teeth.
",36,16,2,3,Washington,Washington3500,Washington," Ah. Booze money.
",18,16,2,3,Bender,Nixon3501,Nixon," I remember my body; flabby, pastey-skinned, riddled with phlebitis. A good Republican body! God, I loved it.
",110,16,2,3,Washington,Fry3502,Fry," I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it was tough love but-- Ooh!
",97,16,2,3,Nixon,Leela3503,Leela," Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong.
",87,16,2,3,Fry,Bender3504,Bender," So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?
",73,16,2,3,Leela,Nixon3505,Nixon," No, son. It's a sad and lonely life.
",38,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3506,Bender," Oh, great. Now you tell me!
",29,16,2,3,Nixon,Nixon3507,Nixon," That's my style. I like to kick 'em when they're down!
",56,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3508,Bender,"  Ones ... zeros ... one, one, zero, zero, one--
",49,16,2,3,Nixon,Fry3509,Fry," Bender, what is it?
",21,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3510,Bender," Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two.
",82,16,2,3,Fry,Fry3511,Fry," It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two.
",60,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3512,Bender," I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned it's back on it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!
",157,16,2,3,Fry,Bender3513,Bender," You sold my body? To who?
",27,16,2,3,Bender,Pawnbroker3514,Pawnbroker," I can't reveal that information, but you look like a nice robot. Tell you what, I'll give you 50 bucks for the kid.
",117,16,2,3,Bender,Fry3515,Fry," Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!
",37,16,2,3,Pawnbroker,Pawnbroker3516,Pawnbroker," Deal.
",7,16,2,3,Fry,Bender3517,Bender,"  Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest of my life like this.
",85,16,2,3,Pawnbroker,Farnsworth3518,Farnsworth," Don't you have a self-destruct button?
",40,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3519,Bender,"  Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?
",49,16,2,3,Farnsworth,Fry3520,Fry," Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!
",55,16,2,3,Bender,Nixon3521,Nixon,"  And so, ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing my head into the ring. I'm announcing my candidacy for the presidency of Earth.
",125,16,2,3,Fry,Journalist #13522,Journalist #1," Just one question.
",20,16,2,3,Nixon,Scoop Chang3523,Scoop Chang," Scoop Chang, Beijing Bugle. Sir, the constitution clearly states that nobody can be elected president more than twice.
",120,16,2,3,Journalist #1,Nixon3524,Nixon," That's right. Nobody.  But as you can plainly see, I've got a shiny new body!
",79,16,2,3,Scoop Chang,Bender3525,Bender," Oh!
",5,16,2,3,Nixon,Leela3526,Leela," Bender, he's got your body!
",29,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3527,Bender," That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!
",78,16,2,3,Leela,Leela3528,Leela," Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop.
",54,16,2,3,Bender,Fry3529,Fry," Yeah, and that electric guitar.
",33,16,2,3,Leela,Nixon3530,Nixon,"  Remember what the dormouse said,
Feed your head.
 I'm meeting you half way, you stupid hippies!  I am not a crook's head!
",124,16,2,3,Fry,Bender3531,Bender," Yeah, you are, you stole my body! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me!
",66,16,2,3,Nixon,Leela3532,Leela," Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you on how this is your own fault for being such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is on the loose, we have a duty to take action. Idiot.
",174,16,2,3,Bender,Morbo3533,Morbo," Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates: Puny Human #1, Puny Human #2, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.
",118,16,2,3,Leela,Nixon3534,Nixon," Hello, Morbo. How's the family?
",33,16,2,3,Morbo,Morbo3535,Morbo," Belligerent and numerous.
",27,16,2,3,Nixon,Nixon3536,Nixon," Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
",43,16,2,3,Morbo,Bender3537,Bender," Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff.
",61,16,2,3,Nixon,Leela3538,Leela," Come on. We've gotta find some way to talk to him.
",52,16,2,3,Bender,Morbo3539,Morbo," Morbo demands an answer to the following question: If you saw delicious candy in the hands of a small child would you seize and consume it?
",141,16,2,3,Leela,Johnson3540,Johnson," Unthinkable.
",14,16,2,3,Morbo,Jackson3541,Jackson," I wouldn't think of it.
",25,16,2,3,Johnson,Morbo3542,Morbo," What about you, Mr. Nixon? I remind you, you are under a truth-o-scope.
",73,16,2,3,Jackson,Nixon3543,Nixon," Uh, well, I, uh ... the question is-is vague. You don't say what kind of candy, whether anyone is watching or, uh...  At any rate, I certainly wouldn't harm the child.
",169,16,2,3,Morbo,Nixons campaign manager3544,Nixons campaign manager," You scored big points tonight, sir.
",37,16,2,3,Nixon,Nixon3545,Nixon," What are you talking about? They ate me alive out there.
",58,16,2,3,Nixons campaign manager,Nixons campaign manager3546,Nixons campaign manager," Yes, but your body stayed on message. And that message is, ""Look at my shiny new body"". The robots ate it up. You've got real charisma from the neck down.
",156,16,2,3,Nixon,Nixon3547,Nixon," Nixon with charisma? My God, I can rule the universe!
",55,16,2,3,Nixons campaign manager,Bender3548,Bender," Give me my body back, you two-bit thief!
",42,16,2,3,Nixon,Nixon3549,Nixon," Now, look here, you drugged-out Communist. I paid for this body and I'd no sooner return it than I would my little cocker spaniel dog, Checkers.  Shut up, damnit!
",164,16,2,3,Bender,Fry3550,Fry," Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency.
",62,16,2,3,Nixon,Bender3551,Bender," That was a good one!
",22,16,2,3,Fry,Nixon3552,Nixon," Seriously though, I'm never giving back this body. Now beat it! Before I get Cambodian on your asses!
",103,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3553,Bender,"  It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.
",77,16,2,3,Nixon,Fry3554,Fry," No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!
",126,16,2,3,Bender,Leela3555,Leela," I've got a better plan.
",25,16,2,3,Fry,Fry3556,Fry,"  Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?
",41,16,2,3,Leela,Leela3557,Leela,"  They give you a discount if you've been here before.
",55,16,2,3,Fry,Fry3558,Fry," Keep going, we're right behind you.
",37,16,2,3,Leela,Bender3559,Bender," Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!
",34,16,2,3,Fry,Man #13560,Man #1,"  We're in a room!
",19,16,2,3,Bender,Bender3561,Bender," Well then lose some weight.
",29,16,2,3,Man #1,Nixon3562,Nixon,"  Aroo!
",8,16,2,3,Bender,Nixon3563,Nixon,"  Oh, yeah. You women's libbers really know how to party!
",58,16,2,3,Nixon,Bender3564,Bender,"  Psst! There I am!
",20,16,2,3,Nixon,Nixon3565,Nixon,"  Hey, Betty Friedan, send a little of that lotion my way!
",59,16,2,3,Bender,Leela3566,Leela," OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic.
",49,16,2,3,Nixon,Fry3567,Fry," Ooh!  Uh-oh!
",14,16,2,3,Leela,Nixon3568,Nixon," What the--  You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve!
",51,16,2,3,Fry,Bender3569,Bender," I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck.
",62,16,2,3,Nixon,Nixon3570,Nixon," Bring it on, soup can.
",24,16,2,3,Bender,Leela3571,Leela," Alright, break it up, you two!
",32,16,2,3,Nixon,Nixon3572,Nixon," That's it. You're all going to jail. And don't expect me to grant a pardon like that sissy, Ford.
",99,16,2,3,Leela,Leela3573,Leela," You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president. The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time.
",152,16,2,3,Nixon,Nixon3574,Nixon," Oh, no? Well, listen here, missy. Computers may be twice as fast as they were in 1973 but your average voter is as drunk and stupid as ever. The only one who's changed is me. I've become bitter and, let's face it, crazy over the years. And once I'm swept into office, I'll sell our children's organs to zoos for meat and I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place.
",384,16,2,3,Leela,Fry3575,Fry," Well, he lost my vote.
",24,16,2,3,Nixon,Nixon3576,Nixon," Like one vote ever made a difference. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to inch myself over to the phone and call the police.
",129,16,2,3,Fry,Bender3577,Bender," Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?
",55,16,2,3,Nixon,Nixon3578,Nixon," Uh-oh. I don't like where this is heading.
",44,16,2,3,Bender,Nixon3579,Nixon,"  And I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place!
",68,16,2,3,Nixon,Nixon3580,Nixon," My God? I really sound like that? I thought my voice had more of a Clark Gable quality.
",89,16,2,3,Nixon,Leela3581,Leela," The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you the tape for the body.
",61,16,2,3,Nixon,Nixon3582,Nixon," Oh, expletive deleted. You've got a deal.
",43,16,2,3,Leela,Fry3583,Fry," Hey, I've got one last thought.
",33,16,2,3,Nixon,Bender3584,Bender," Ah, it's good to be back in one piece again. Except I can't get these damn bumper stickers off.
",97,16,2,3,Fry,Linda3585,Linda,"  The sheer drama of this election has driven voter turnout to its highest level in centuries. 6%
",98,16,2,3,Bender,Morbo3586,Morbo,"  Exit polls show evil underdog Richard Nixon trailing with an estimated zero votes.
",85,16,2,3,Linda,Leela3587,Leela," Yes! The system works!
",24,16,2,3,Morbo,Linda3588,Linda,"  The time is 7:59 and the robot polls are now opening ... and the robot vote is in. Nixon has won!
",100,16,2,3,Leela,Leela3589,Leela," No!
",5,16,2,3,Linda,Fry3590,Fry," What?
",7,16,2,3,Leela,Bender3591,Bender," Get out of town!
",18,16,2,3,Fry,Fry3592,Fry," Why would robots vote for Nixon now that he's just a head in a jar?
",69,16,2,3,Bender,Nixons campaign manager3593,Nixons campaign manager," I give you the next president of Earth!
",41,16,2,3,Fry,Nixon3594,Nixon,"  Nixon's back!
",16,16,2,3,Nixons campaign manager,Farnsworth3595,Farnsworth," I can't believe it. He won by a single vote.
",46,16,2,3,Nixon,Bender3596,Bender," Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you.
",60,16,2,3,Farnsworth,Fry3597,Fry," Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote.
",56,16,2,3,Bender,Leela3598,Leela," Oh, crud. I knew there was something I meant to do today.
",59,16,2,3,Fry,Morbo3599,Morbo,"  Morbo congratulates our gargantuan cyborg president. May death come quickly to his enemies.
",94,16,2,3,Leela,Nixon3600,Nixon," Aroo! Who's kicking who around now?  Aroo! Aroo!
",50,16,2,3,Morbo,Nixon3601,Nixon," Knock, knock!
",15,16,2,3,Nixon,Announcer #13602,Announcer #1," Ladies and gentlemen, Conan O'Brien's head.
",45,17,2,4,Nixon,OBrien3603,OBrien," Thank you, thank you. Let's get started. Max, play me over.  Looks like someone forgot to feed Max.  So, people are getting pretty worried about this Y2K problem, huh?
",169,17,2,4,Announcer #1,Bender3604,Bender," No, they fixed that 900 years ago.
",36,17,2,4,OBrien,OBrien3605,OBrien," Just bear with me, sir. Anyway, I'm walking to work this morning--
",68,17,2,4,Bender,Bender3606,Bender," I doubt it!
",13,17,2,4,OBrien,OBrien3607,OBrien," Listen, pal, I may have lost my freakishly long legs in the war of 2012 but I've still got something you'll never have: A soul!
",129,17,2,4,Bender,Bender3608,Bender," Eh.
",5,17,2,4,OBrien,OBrien3609,OBrien," And freckles!  Well, I'm out of material. You can catch me next week at the Andromeda Chuckle Hut. Enjoy your breakfast.
",122,17,2,4,Bender,Bender3610,Bender," Ah, let's face it: Comedy's a dead art form. Now, tragedy...  That's funny!
",77,17,2,4,OBrien,Farnsworth3611,Farnsworth," Come on, everyone. Perhaps some skiing will help us forget the mouldy old antics of Conan O'Brien.
",100,17,2,4,Bender,Amy3612,Amy," Yeah!
",7,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Leela3613,Leela," Great idea!
",13,17,2,4,Amy,Zoidberg3614,Zoidberg," We can only hope!
",19,17,2,4,Leela,Fry3615,Fry," This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened.
",65,17,2,4,Zoidberg,Leela3616,Leela," Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out.
",65,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3617,Fry," Hi!
",5,17,2,4,Leela,Bender3618,Bender," Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going.
",52,17,2,4,Fry,Hermes3619,Hermes," Jah damnit! We're stuck.
",26,17,2,4,Bender,Zoidberg3620,Zoidberg,"  At least you're not cold-blooded!
",36,17,2,4,Hermes,Hermes3621,Hermes," Sweet lion of Zion! Look at the Professor go.
",47,17,2,4,Zoidberg,Fry3622,Fry," Look out! We're heading straight for those trees!
",51,17,2,4,Hermes,Leela3623,Leela," Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down.
",32,17,2,4,Fry,Trees3624,Trees,"  Trees down.
",14,17,2,4,Leela,Fry3625,Fry," Cool. Hey, what do you do if you want the trees up?
",53,17,2,4,Trees,Trees3626,Trees,"  Trees up.
",12,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3627,Fry,"  Trees down!
",14,17,2,4,Trees,Trees3628,Trees,"  Trees down.
",14,17,2,4,Fry,Bender3629,Bender," Lookin' good, meatball!
",25,17,2,4,Trees,Man #13630,Man #1," Excuse me, sir, you're snowboarding off the trail.
",52,17,2,4,Bender,Bender3631,Bender," Lick my frozen, metal ass.  Uh-oh!
",36,17,2,4,Man #1,Child3632,Child,"  Mommy!
",9,17,2,4,Bender,Zoidberg3633,Zoidberg," You, a bobsledder? That I'd like to see!
",42,17,2,4,Child,Hermes3634,Hermes," Listen, you filthy crab, a thousand years ago there was a legendary team of Jamaican bobsledders.
",99,17,2,4,Zoidberg,Fry3635,Fry," Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote alcoholic beverages.
",97,17,2,4,Hermes,Hermes3636,Hermes," A true inspiration for the children.  Um, a little help please?   Nooo!
",73,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3637,Fry," Oh, what the hell!  Ow!
",25,17,2,4,Hermes,Amy3638,Amy," You poor man. What happened to you?
",37,17,2,4,Fry,Man #1 #23639,Man #1 #2," Well, there I was on the triple diamond slope, when suddenly--
",64,17,2,4,Amy,Amy3640,Amy," Oh, excuse me.  Hello, there!
",31,17,2,4,Man #1 #2,Farnsworth3641,Farnsworth," Wha?
",6,17,2,4,Amy,Bender3642,Bender," Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.
",65,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Fry3643,Fry," Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit.
",51,17,2,4,Bender,Farnsworth3644,Farnsworth," What-mas?
",11,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3645,Fry," Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S.
",31,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Leela3646,Leela," Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like when you say ""ask"" instead of ""aks"".
",106,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3647,Fry," Xmas, huh?  Y'know, this'll be my first Xmas away from home.
",62,17,2,4,Leela,Leela3648,Leela," Hey, hey. Let me aks you something: Would it cheer you up if we went and cut down an Xmas tree?
",97,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3649,Fry," Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree!
",35,17,2,4,Leela,Fry3650,Fry," Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!
",31,17,2,4,Fry,Farnsworth3651,Farnsworth," Eh, wha?
",10,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3652,Fry," They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree.
",57,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3653,Farnsworth," Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and your primitive notions of modesty.  Ah! Brisk!
",128,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3654,Fry," This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.
",49,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3655,Farnsworth," There, there.
",15,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3656,Fry," Everything's changed.
",23,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Leela3657,Leela," That's not true.
",18,17,2,4,Fry,Bender3658,Bender," Â : Xmas tree, oh, Xmas tree! Bah-boo-bee-boo-bah-bee-boh.
",59,17,2,4,Leela,Amy3659,Amy," Ow!
",5,17,2,4,Bender,Fry3660,Fry," Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes.  This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas.
",248,17,2,4,Amy,Hermes3661,Hermes," Happy Xmas, Xmas people! Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas!  Amy, there you go. Fry, Professor, Zoidberg, a mighty haul for Bender.
",129,17,2,4,Fry,Bender3662,Bender," Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!
",34,17,2,4,Hermes,Hermes3663,Hermes," And last, but not least, the sweet flower of the office: Me. Hermes Conrad.
",77,17,2,4,Bender,Bender3664,Bender," Hmm.  Ah, a picture of my mommy.
",34,17,2,4,Hermes,Zoidberg3665,Zoidberg," Huh? What's this?  A card from my cousin Zoidfarb.  Instead of ""Claus"" he writes ""Claws""! Now that's humorous. Today's comedians could learn from this card.
",158,17,2,4,Bender,Fry3666,Fry," What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the loneliest person on Earth.  Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy here, huh?  Yoiks! What was that about?
",192,17,2,4,Zoidberg,Amy3667,Amy," Fluh! She's an orphan.
",24,17,2,4,Fry,Farnsworth3668,Farnsworth," Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life.
",85,17,2,4,Amy,Fry3669,Fry," My God! Poor Leela.
",21,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Bender3670,Bender,"  Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well, old Bender'll make you laugh.  Look at me, look!  Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!
",133,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3671,Fry," I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself.
",114,17,2,4,Bender,Amy3672,Amy," I'll do it for you.
",21,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3673,Fry," Ow! Thanks.
",13,17,2,4,Amy,Farnsworth3674,Farnsworth," You should be ashamed of yourself, Fry. You'd have to be blind not to notice that Leela's a cyclops.
",102,17,2,4,Fry,Hermes3675,Hermes," Fry's over there, man.
",24,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3676,Farnsworth," Oh?
",5,17,2,4,Hermes,Bender3677,Bender," Xmas Eve; another pointless day where I accomplish nothing.
",61,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Linda3678,Linda,"  The holiday season is a time of celebration for most. But it is also a time to remember the tragic suffering of the less fortunate.
",134,17,2,4,Bender,Morbo3679,Morbo,"  Earthlings do not yet know the meaning of suffering.
",55,17,2,4,Linda,Linda3680,Linda,"  Earlier today I visited a shelter for down-and-out robots.  Homeless robots, too poor to afford even the basic alcohol they need to fuel their circuits. Is there anything sadder? Only drowning puppies. And there would have to be a lot of them.
",246,17,2,4,Morbo,Amy3681,Amy," Where are you going, Bender?
",30,17,2,4,Linda,Bender3682,Bender," To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.
",55,17,2,4,Amy,Hermes3683,Hermes," Yeah, right! As if you ever did anything charitable.
",54,17,2,4,Bender,Bender3684,Bender," I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?
",55,17,2,4,Hermes,Fry3685,Fry," Whose blood?
",14,17,2,4,Bender,Bender3686,Bender," Some guy's.
",13,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3687,Fry," I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am.
",56,17,2,4,Bender,Zoidberg3688,Zoidberg," So what's the problem? Just get down on your claws and do the apology dance.
",78,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3689,Fry," So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out and get her the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to be unhappy again.
",165,17,2,4,Zoidberg,Hermes3690,Hermes," Just be back by sundown, mon.
",31,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3691,Fry," We'll see. I like to haggle.
",30,17,2,4,Hermes,Amy3692,Amy," You can't stay out on Xmas Eve. You'll be killed!
",51,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3693,Fry," Say what?
",11,17,2,4,Amy,Farnsworth3694,Farnsworth," Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus.
",47,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3695,Fry," I know about Santa Claus.
",27,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3696,Farnsworth," Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine who'd be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But something went wrong.
",177,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3697,Fry," Wow! 2801! Anyway...
",22,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3698,Farnsworth," Wait, you fool! Due to a programming error, Santa's standards were set too high and he invariably judges everyone to be naughty.
",130,17,2,4,Fry,Amy3699,Amy," If he catches you after dark, he'll chop off your head and stuff your neck full of toys from his sack of horrors.
",115,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3700,Farnsworth," Nice meeting you.
",19,17,2,4,Amy,Preacherbot3701,Preacherbot," Welcome, brother! May the blessings of the season be upon you.
",64,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Bender3702,Bender," Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze.  Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
",147,17,2,4,Preacherbot,Fry3703,Fry," There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?
",81,17,2,4,Bender,Salesman #1 #13704,Salesman #1 #1," Yeah, there's a suicide booth in the food court. Though there's a line this time of year.
",91,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3705,Fry," No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown.
",61,17,2,4,Salesman #1 #1,Salesman #1 #13706,Salesman #1 #1," Well, you can't go wrong with something traditional.  A Surface-to-Santa rocket launcher. It comes with three jolly-seeking missiles.
",135,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3707,Fry," That's funny!
",15,17,2,4,Salesman #1 #1,Salesman #1 #13708,Salesman #1 #1," Careful, sir!
",15,17,2,4,Fry,Bender3709,Bender," Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure know how to live.  Hey, chief, someone's stealing your handkerchief full of crap.
",115,17,2,4,Salesman #1 #1,Tinny Tim3710,Tinny Tim," Excuse me, sir? Might I have a sip of booze?
",46,17,2,4,Bender,Preacherbot3711,Preacherbot," I'm sorry, Tinny Tim. Seems we ran out early tonight.
",55,17,2,4,Tinny Tim,Tinny Tim3712,Tinny Tim," I understand.
",15,17,2,4,Preacherbot,Bender3713,Bender," My God! That poor kid!
",24,17,2,4,Tinny Tim,Fry3714,Fry," You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela.  Just give me your best animal.
",99,17,2,4,Bender,Salesman #1 #23715,Salesman #1 #2," Best? Well that's a matter of opinion. I personally like the Electric Snail.
",78,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3716,Fry," That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now which costs more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?
",122,17,2,4,Salesman #1 #2,Salesman #1 #23717,Salesman #1 #2," The lizards are a buck each, the parrot is $500.
",50,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3718,Fry," That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?
",124,17,2,4,Salesman #1 #2,Salesman #1 #23719,Salesman #1 #2," Sir, the store is closing in two minutes.
",43,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3720,Fry," Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The parrot!
",83,17,2,4,Salesman #1 #2,Fry3721,Fry," Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you.  Hey, you're quite the talker, aren't you?  Shut the hell up!  Ow!  Stupid bird! I know where you live.
",171,17,2,4,Fry,Amy3722,Amy," Hey, it's Leela.
",18,17,2,4,Fry,Leela3723,Leela," Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.
",68,17,2,4,Amy,Farnsworth3724,Farnsworth," Huh? You were gone?
",21,17,2,4,Leela,Leela3725,Leela," It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself.
",68,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Hermes3726,Hermes," I hear that! I aks him to set the table, instead he goes out to buy you a present. Selfish dog.
",97,17,2,4,Leela,Leela3727,Leela," Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!
",54,17,2,4,Hermes,Zoidberg3728,Zoidberg," Why?
",6,17,2,4,Leela,Leela3729,Leela," I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!
",53,17,2,4,Zoidberg,Fry3730,Fry," Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But you just met your equal.
",94,17,2,4,Leela,Fry3731,Fry," Aha! Cornered!
",16,17,2,4,Fry,Leela3732,Leela," Hi, there!
",12,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3733,Fry," Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards!
",75,17,2,4,Leela,Leela3734,Leela," You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry.
",43,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3735,Fry," I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you never even had a family.
",108,17,2,4,Leela,Leela3736,Leela," It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But, together, we're lonely together.
",78,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3737,Fry," Merry Xmas, Leela.
",20,17,2,4,Leela,Leela3738,Leela," Merry Xmas.
",13,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3739,Fry," Oh, boy! It's Santa!
",22,17,2,4,Leela,Santa3740,Santa," Ho, ho, ho!  You've been very naughty, Fry and Leela. I checked my list.
",74,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3741,Fry," Well check it twice!
",22,17,2,4,Santa,Santa3742,Santa," I perform over 50 mega-checks per second. You're both naughty for disregarding each other's feelings.
",103,17,2,4,Fry,Leela3743,Leela," But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.
",72,17,2,4,Santa,Santa3744,Santa," But what about your other co-workers? Did either of you ever stop to think about Dr. Zoidberg's feelings?
",107,17,2,4,Leela,Fry3745,Fry," No! I swear!
",14,17,2,4,Santa,Santa3746,Santa," Santa has something very special in his sack for you two!
",59,17,2,4,Fry,Robot #1s3747,Robot #1s,"  So lock the door and hit the floor,
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.
",72,17,2,4,Santa,Hattie McDoogal3748,Hattie McDoogal," Go away!
",10,17,2,4,Robot #1s,Bender3749,Bender," Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard cider?
",80,17,2,4,Hattie McDoogal,Hattie McDoogal3750,Hattie McDoogal," Oh, alright. But just one glass!   OK, that's enough.  I said that's enough!
",78,17,2,4,Bender,Bender3751,Bender,"  Get her purse!
",17,17,2,4,Hattie McDoogal,Fry3752,Fry," Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!
",61,17,2,4,Bender,Santa3753,Santa," You dare bribe Santa? I'm going to shove coal so far up your stocking you'll be coughing up diamonds!
",103,17,2,4,Fry,Leela3754,Leela," We're trapped.
",16,17,2,4,Santa,Fry3755,Fry," I never thought it would end this way: Gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I didn't see it coming!
",102,17,2,4,Leela,Leela3756,Leela," Goodbye, Fry.
",15,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3757,Fry," Goodbye, Leela.  Hey, look, we're under the mistletoe.
",56,17,2,4,Leela,Santa3758,Santa," Your mistletoe is no match for my T.O.W. missile!
",51,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3759,Fry," Uh, you're present may need some assembly.
",44,17,2,4,Santa,Bender3760,Bender,"  On the 4th day of Xmas I stole from that lady.
",49,17,2,4,Fry,Robot #1 #13761,Robot #1 #1,"  Four family photos.
",22,17,2,4,Bender,Tinny Tim3762,Tinny Tim,"  Three jars of pennies.
",25,17,2,4,Robot #1 #1,Robot #1 #23763,Robot #1 #2,"  Two former husbands.
",23,17,2,4,Tinny Tim,Bender3764,Bender,"  And a slipper on a shoe tree.
",32,17,2,4,Robot #1 #2,Raoul3765,Raoul," Oh, thank you!
",16,17,2,4,Bender,Fry3766,Fry,"  Help!
",8,17,2,4,Raoul,Leela3767,Leela,"  Somebody help us.
",20,17,2,4,Fry,Tinny Tim3768,Tinny Tim," It's humans. Shall we mug them, robot sir?
",44,17,2,4,Leela,Bender3769,Bender," No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing.
",48,17,2,4,Tinny Tim,Santa3770,Santa," Ho, ho, ho!  You've been very naughty, Bender.
",48,17,2,4,Bender,Bender3771,Bender," What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid.
",60,17,2,4,Santa,Santa3772,Santa," My God, Bender! Framing an orphan? That's so naughty I'll have to add it to my list right now.  Framing ... I-N-G ...  ... an...
",130,17,2,4,Bender,Zoidberg3773,Zoidberg," Amy, this is for you. A set of combs for your beautiful hair.
",63,17,2,4,Santa,Amy3774,Amy," Oh, that's so sweet. But I sold my hair to a wigmaker so I could buy a set of combs for Hermes.
",97,17,2,4,Zoidberg,Hermes3775,Hermes," Oh, the irony. I sold my hair so I could buy this third set of combs for Zoidberg.
",84,17,2,4,Amy,Zoidberg3776,Zoidberg," Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair.  Finally I look as pretty as I feel!
",89,17,2,4,Hermes,Fry3777,Fry,"  Help!
",8,17,2,4,Zoidberg,Leela3778,Leela,"  Help!
",8,17,2,4,Fry,Bender3779,Bender,"  Help!
",8,17,2,4,Leela,Farnsworth3780,Farnsworth," Oh, dear. They'll be killed on our doorstep. And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.
",93,17,2,4,Bender,Hermes3781,Hermes," Sweet manatee of Galilee! He's on the roof!
",45,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3782,Farnsworth," Quick! The armour-plated chimney cover!  Push! Push!
",54,17,2,4,Hermes,Bender3783,Bender," Use teamwork!
",15,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Tinny Tim3784,Tinny Tim," Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
",21,17,2,4,Bender,Santa3785,Santa," You've all been very naughty, very naughty indeed. Except you, Dr. Zoidberg, this is for you.
",95,17,2,4,Tinny Tim,Zoidberg3786,Zoidberg," A pogo-stick!
",15,17,2,4,Santa,Santa3787,Santa," As for the rest of you, I'm going to tear off your skin like wrapping paper and deck the halls with your guts.
",112,17,2,4,Zoidberg,Bender3788,Bender," Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you don't believe in him, he can't hurt you.  Ow! God! The pain!
",132,17,2,4,Santa,Santa3789,Santa," Ho, ho, ho! Time to get jolly on your naughty asses!
",54,17,2,4,Bender,Leela3790,Leela," Watch out! His belly is shaking like a bowl full of nitro-glycerine!
",70,17,2,4,Santa,Amy3791,Amy," Rudolph's nose!
",17,17,2,4,Leela,Fry3792,Fry,"  He's gonna blow!
",19,17,2,4,Amy,Zoidberg3793,Zoidberg," Aha!
",6,17,2,4,Fry,Farnsworth3794,Farnsworth," Yes, good thing I got us out of that one!
",43,17,2,4,Zoidberg,Bender3795,Bender," Xmas dinner, everyone.
",24,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Fry3796,Fry," Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?
",42,17,2,4,Bender,Bender3797,Bender," I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone.
",77,17,2,4,Fry,Tinny Tim3798,Tinny Tim," Thank you, sir.
",17,17,2,4,Bender,Bender3799,Bender," You got the toenail!  Oh!
",27,17,2,4,Tinny Tim,Fry3800,Fry," Look, the food isn't what's important.
",40,17,2,4,Bender,Tinny Tim3801,Tinny Tim," I'm so hungry.
",16,17,2,4,Fry,Fry3802,Fry," The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home.
",153,17,2,4,Tinny Tim,Farnsworth3803,Farnsworth," Hear, hear! Now let's all of us shut up and sing!
",51,17,2,4,Fry,Amy3804,Amy,"  He knows when you are sleeping.
",34,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3805,Farnsworth,"  He knows when you're on the can.
",35,17,2,4,Amy,Leela3806,Leela,"  He'll hunt you down and blast your ass from here to Pakistan.
",64,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Zoidberg3807,Zoidberg,"  Oh.
",6,17,2,4,Leela,Hermes3808,Hermes,"  You'd better not breathe, You'd better not move.
",51,17,2,4,Zoidberg,Bender3809,Bender,"  You're better off dead, I'm telling you, dude.
",49,17,2,4,Hermes,Fry3810,Fry,"  Santa Claus is gunning you down!
",35,17,2,4,Bender,Farnsworth3811,Farnsworth," Merry Xmas, everyone!
",23,17,2,4,Fry,Santa3812,Santa,"  I'll be back. Back when you least expect it: Next Xmas! Ho, ho, ho!
",70,17,2,4,Farnsworth,Singer3813,Singer,"  Call Robo-Rooter when you flush your towel.
",46,18,2,5,Santa,Plumber-bot3814,Plumber-bot,"  And we can also help with an impacted bowel.
",47,18,2,5,Singer,Singer3815,Singer,"  Robo-Rooter!
",15,18,2,5,Plumber-bot,Fry3816,Fry," Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress: A Bavarian cream dog that's also self-microwaving!
",116,18,2,5,Singer,Bender3817,Bender," Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer.  Oh, what is this, the Middle Ages?
",109,18,2,5,Fry,Leela3818,Leela," Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap.
",74,18,2,5,Bender,Fry3819,Fry," Sack?
",7,18,2,5,Leela,Amy3820,Amy," And, Bender, your beer belly's so big your door won't even close. And that doesn't even make sense.
",101,18,2,5,Fry,Leela3821,Leela," Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym.
",44,18,2,5,Amy,Zoidberg3822,Zoidberg," The gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. For some reason I'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday.
",88,18,2,5,Leela,Amy3823,Amy," Hey, who's up for a nice, hot steam?
",38,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3824,Zoidberg," We crustaceans don't like steam. I'm going to go work out with the Nautilus!
",78,18,2,5,Amy,Nautilus3825,Nautilus," What up, Dr. Z?
",17,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3826,Zoidberg," Yo, yo, yo! Whassup, whassup! Give up the rock!
",49,18,2,5,Nautilus,Fry3827,Fry," Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!
",39,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Leela3828,Leela," Uh, Fry, you're in the women's steam room.
",44,18,2,5,Fry,Fry3829,Fry," Ah, futuristic!
",17,18,2,5,Leela,Amy3830,Amy," Psst, look what life was like before genetic engineering.
",59,18,2,5,Fry,Leela3831,Leela," Those poor 20th century women.
",32,18,2,5,Amy,Amy3832,Amy,"  Hey, handsome. Is there room in there for two?
",49,18,2,5,Leela,Man #13833,Man #1," You wish!
",11,18,2,5,Amy,Fry3834,Fry," Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!
",40,18,2,5,Man #1,Leela3835,Leela," Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you.
",71,18,2,5,Fry,Zoidberg3836,Zoidberg," Give me that.  More weight!
",29,18,2,5,Leela,Fry3837,Fry," Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?
",51,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3838,Zoidberg," Enough with the questions. More weight!  More!  More!
",55,18,2,5,Fry,Leela3839,Leela," Maybe you could do more reps with less weight.
",48,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Bender3840,Bender," Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell.  Get it?  He's coming out--
",89,18,2,5,Leela,Randy3841,Randy," Nice and gentle, we don't want any unnecessary stress.  Is there a doctor in the gym?
",87,18,2,5,Bender,Zoidberg3842,Zoidberg," I'm a doctor!
",15,18,2,5,Randy,Leela3843,Leela," I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always seemed the most normal.
",98,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3844,Zoidberg," I am normal.  Amy, take off these rubber bands and I'll show you how normal I am!
",83,18,2,5,Leela,Amy3845,Amy," Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool me eight or more times, shame on me.
",78,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Fry3846,Fry," Maybe he has a parasite.
",26,18,2,5,Amy,Hermes3847,Hermes," Maybe he is a parasite!
",25,18,2,5,Fry,Bender3848,Bender," It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!
",105,18,2,5,Hermes,Farnsworth3849,Farnsworth," Now, now, this won't do. Let me just give old Zoidy a sedative.
",65,18,2,5,Bender,Zoidberg3850,Zoidberg," Ah, much better. You can take off these rubber bands now.
",59,18,2,5,Farnsworth,Amy3851,Amy," I'll do it.
",13,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Leela3852,Leela,"  Stop!
",8,18,2,5,Amy,Fry3853,Fry,"  No, Amy!
",11,18,2,5,Leela,Bender3854,Bender," Moron!
",8,18,2,5,Fry,Farnsworth3855,Farnsworth," Mm-hm...  Oh-ho!  Aha! There's the problem.
",45,18,2,5,Bender,Zoidberg3856,Zoidberg," Give it to me straight, Professor. Is it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't it? Tell me it's not fin rot!
",101,18,2,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3857,Farnsworth," Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no problem. You're just heavy with male jelly.
",81,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Leela3858,Leela," Bleck!
",8,18,2,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3859,Farnsworth," It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people; a chaotic time when his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.
",126,18,2,5,Leela,Fry3860,Fry," Eck!
",6,18,2,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3861,Farnsworth," There's only one thing we can do--
",36,18,2,5,Fry,Bender3862,Bender," I'll get the water boiling!
",29,18,2,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth3863,Farnsworth," We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld which will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex.
",130,18,2,5,Bender,Fry3864,Fry," Oh, baby, I'm there!
",22,18,2,5,Farnsworth,Leela3865,Leela," Fry, do you even understand the word ""invertebrate""?
",54,18,2,5,Fry,Fry3866,Fry," Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in.  Uh, no need to pack pants, people. Let's roll!
",98,18,2,5,Leela,Amy3867,Amy," Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these while he's gone.
",56,18,2,5,Fry,Bender3868,Bender,"  Moron!
",9,18,2,5,Amy,Decapodian Man #1 #13869,Decapodian Man #1 #1," Welcome home, old friend. Just 19 hours until the mating frenzy!
",66,18,2,5,Bender,Zoidberg3870,Zoidberg," Excellent, excellent!
",23,18,2,5,Decapodian Man #1 #1,Decapodian Man #1 #13871,Decapodian Man #1 #1," See you there, Doctor--
",25,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Fry3872,Fry," Is that how you say ""Zoidberg""?
",33,18,2,5,Decapodian Man #1 #1,Zoidberg3873,Zoidberg," You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.
",61,18,2,5,Fry,Bender3874,Bender," You're looking less nuts, crabby.
",35,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3875,Zoidberg," I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly in the cloacal vents of a female.  If you catch my drift.
",140,18,2,5,Bender,Fry3876,Fry,"  Who's the lucky lobsterina?
",30,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3877,Zoidberg," I don't know yet. But I shall attract one this afternoon with an erotic display.
",82,18,2,5,Fry,Leela3878,Leela," It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.
",57,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3879,Zoidberg," Love? That word is unknown here. I'm simply looking for a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material.
",115,18,2,5,Leela,Fry3880,Fry," You and me both, brother!
",27,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3881,Zoidberg," Ah, my old scuttling grounds! Let's pull over.
",48,18,2,5,Fry,Zoidberg3882,Zoidberg," I used to hang out here as a larva. It looked so much bigger back then.  Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?
",107,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Bender3883,Bender," Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!
",57,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3884,Zoidberg," No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, where my species fight to the death over matters of honour. Also whether abbreviations count in Scrabble.  They don't!
",157,18,2,5,Bender,Fry3885,Fry," I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do your erotic display?
",104,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3886,Zoidberg," Same place as your species: The beach.
",40,18,2,5,Fry,Zoidberg3887,Zoidberg," How do I look?
",16,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Bender3888,Bender," Like whale barf.
",18,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3889,Zoidberg," Then the illusion is complete.
",32,18,2,5,Bender,Fry3890,Fry," Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too.
",71,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Decapodian Man #1 #23891,Decapodian Man #1 #2," Aw, yeah! Aw, wow!
",20,18,2,5,Fry,Zoidberg3892,Zoidberg," Perfect! This oughta make me stand out.  Craw!
",48,18,2,5,Decapodian Man #1 #2,Fry3893,Fry," Look how ridiculous they look.
",32,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Bender3894,Bender," Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; shooting DNA at each other make babies. I find it offensive.
",120,18,2,5,Fry,Zoidberg3895,Zoidberg," Craw!
",7,18,2,5,Bender,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1 #13896,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1 #1," Keep your jelly away from my eggs!
",36,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3897,Zoidberg," Craw?
",7,18,2,5,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1 #1,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1 #23898,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1 #2," So not interested.
",20,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3899,Zoidberg," Craw!
",7,18,2,5,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1 #2,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1 #33900,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1 #3," Humph. I've heard that line before!
",37,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3901,Zoidberg," Cra-- Oh, what's the point?
",29,18,2,5,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1 #3,Leela3902,Leela," Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
",43,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Bender3903,Bender," 'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry.
",70,18,2,5,Leela,Fry3904,Fry," Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.
",67,18,2,5,Bender,Zoidberg3905,Zoidberg," Edna? Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember, from high school?  You used to laugh at me because my face was covered with barnacles!
",129,18,2,5,Fry,Edna3906,Edna," Zoidberg? Well I didn't know you were back in town. I heard you went off and became a rich doctor.
",100,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3907,Zoidberg," I've performed a few mercy killings. So, as long as I'm in town I was wondering if maybe ... craw?
",100,18,2,5,Edna,Edna3908,Edna," Oh, gee, yeah, I'm just going through a lot of things right now and-- Look, Zoidberg, I carry more eggs than any other female and I owe it to our race to pick a mate who's stuffed with male jelly. Maybe a rock star.
",217,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3909,Zoidberg," Or maybe a doctor?
",20,18,2,5,Edna,Edna3910,Edna," I'm sorry, Zoidberg. You're just an inferior male specimen. Nice seeing you again.
",84,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3911,Zoidberg,"  No one will ever want to mate with me, not with a puny claw like this. Did you see those other guys? They looked like giant claws with bodies attached.
",154,18,2,5,Edna,Leela3912,Leela," At least you didn't smell as bad as them.
",43,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3913,Zoidberg,"  You're right, my stink gland is weak. Smell!
",47,18,2,5,Leela,Fry3914,Fry," Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love.  Just look her in the eye, start crying and say  ""I've never been so happy.""
",146,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Leela3915,Leela," If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing that to me. Even Sean!
",104,18,2,5,Fry,Zoidberg3916,Zoidberg," Hmm, this ""love"" intrigues me. Teach me to fake it.
",53,18,2,5,Leela,Fry3917,Fry," OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?
",54,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3918,Zoidberg," Ask her to mate with me.
",26,18,2,5,Fry,Fry3919,Fry," No. Tell her she's special.
",29,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3920,Zoidberg," But she's not. She's merely the female with the largest clutch of eggs.
",73,18,2,5,Fry,Fry3921,Fry," Well, tell her that. And then?
",32,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3922,Zoidberg," Then mating.
",14,18,2,5,Fry,Fry3923,Fry," No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them.  Yes?
",61,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3924,Zoidberg," Is ""desire to mate"" a feeling?
",32,18,2,5,Fry,Fry3925,Fry," You're not even trying!
",25,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3926,Zoidberg," It's all so complicated with the flowers and the romance and the lies upon lies.
",82,18,2,5,Fry,Fry3927,Fry," OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing.
",69,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3928,Zoidberg," What? Now there's a bird involved?
",36,18,2,5,Fry,Fry3929,Fry," OK, go ahead.
",15,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Edna3930,Edna," What the-- Dr. Zoidberg, your mating display failed. Why are you trying to talk to me?
",88,18,2,5,Fry,Zoidberg3931,Zoidberg,"  I have no idea.
",18,18,2,5,Edna,Fry3932,Fry,"  You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating.
",57,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3933,Zoidberg,"  I just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating.  Fry, that doesn't make sense.
",86,18,2,5,Fry,Edna3934,Edna," Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But OK.
",48,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Fry3935,Fry,"  Start with a compliment. Tell her she looks thin.
",52,18,2,5,Edna,Zoidberg3936,Zoidberg,"  You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
",68,18,2,5,Fry,Edna3937,Edna," Why, yes. Thanks for noticing.
",32,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Fry3938,Fry,"  Now ask her how her day was.
",31,18,2,5,Edna,Zoidberg3939,Zoidberg," Why would I wanna know?
",25,18,2,5,Fry,Fry3940,Fry,"  You wouldn't. Ask anyway.
",28,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3941,Zoidberg,"  How was your day?
",20,18,2,5,Fry,Edna3942,Edna," Well first I got up and had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth. Then I went to the store to buy some fish. Then...
",123,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3943,Zoidberg," Fry, look what you did, she won't shut up.
",44,18,2,5,Edna,Fry3944,Fry,"  That's normal. Just nod your head and say ""Uh-huh"".
",54,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3945,Zoidberg,"  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
",18,18,2,5,Fry,Edna3946,Edna," ...And then you threw an octopus at my window. You know, Zoidberg, it's crazy but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies as a male seem ... less obvious. Your genes seem less detrimental.  You even stink more.
",221,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3947,Zoidberg," Do I ask her to mate now?
",27,18,2,5,Edna,Fry3948,Fry,"  Third date!
",14,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Bender3949,Bender," So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender.
",102,18,2,5,Fry,Zoidberg3950,Zoidberg,"  I'd like to propose a toast to ... coat check number 84.
",59,18,2,5,Bender,Fry3951,Fry,"  Turn it over.
",16,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3952,Zoidberg," Oh, Edna!  Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet, you are apparently the hottest.
",98,18,2,5,Fry,Bender3953,Bender," Oy.
",5,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Fry3954,Fry,"  That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
",51,18,2,5,Bender,Edna3955,Edna," Yes, well ... excuse me, I've got to powder my mouth flaps.
",61,18,2,5,Fry,Leela3956,Leela," Uh, me too.
",13,18,2,5,Edna,Zoidberg3957,Zoidberg," I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when you care about a female for reasons beyond mating?
",122,18,2,5,Leela,Fry3958,Fry," Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.
",41,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Leela3959,Leela," Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on your planet?
",161,18,2,5,Fry,Edna3960,Edna," Fry? You mean words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous alien?
",82,18,2,5,Leela,Leela3961,Leela," Yeah ... what? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor, honey.
",82,18,2,5,Edna,Edna3962,Edna," Hmm.
",6,18,2,5,Leela,Edna3963,Edna,"  Come in.
",11,18,2,5,Edna,Edna3964,Edna,"  Hello, Fry. Can I interest you in some surf and turf?
",56,18,2,5,Edna,Fry3965,Fry," No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo.
",108,18,2,5,Edna,Edna3966,Edna," Well that is where it comes out but jelly isn't everything.  I know Zoidberg's magical words were really yours. Teach me to love you, squishy poet from beyond the stars!
",171,18,2,5,Fry,Fry3967,Fry," Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd be way up the list!
",102,18,2,5,Edna,Edna3968,Edna," Hush, you romantic fool! Engage your mandibles and kiss me!
",61,18,2,5,Fry,Zoidberg3969,Zoidberg," Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. I--   Fry!
",50,18,2,5,Edna,Fry3970,Fry," Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks.
",38,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3971,Zoidberg,"  Her caviar is on your neck!
",30,18,2,5,Fry,Fry3972,Fry," But--
",7,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Edna3973,Edna," Oh, it's true, Zoidberg. We can't hide it any longer. Fry and I have fallen in love and we're going to mate tomorrow.
",119,18,2,5,Fry,Fry3974,Fry," What?
",7,18,2,5,Edna,Zoidberg3975,Zoidberg,"  Fry!  I challenge you to Claw-Plach!
",39,18,2,5,Fry,Fry3976,Fry," English, please?
",18,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3977,Zoidberg," A fight to the death.
",23,18,2,5,Fry,Edna3978,Edna," And if you survive, we'll make sweet love!
",44,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Decapodian Emperor3979,Decapodian Emperor," The law is clear. Fry and Zoidberg shall fight to the death for the claw of the beautiful Edna.
",97,18,2,5,Edna,Fry3980,Fry," But I don't want her!
",23,18,2,5,Decapodian Emperor,Decapodian Emperor3981,Decapodian Emperor," Once invoked, the sacred tradition of Claw-Plach can not be taken back. It is a recent tradition, only 18 years old, but it is a tradition none the less.
",155,18,2,5,Fry,Zoidberg3982,Zoidberg," Get ready, Fry. I'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you.
",76,18,2,5,Decapodian Emperor,Leela3983,Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational.
",57,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3984,Zoidberg,"  Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love!
",47,18,2,5,Leela,Leela3985,Leela," Aww.
",6,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Fry3986,Fry," Leela!
",8,18,2,5,Leela,Leela3987,Leela," Right, right.  You have to stop this madness.
",47,18,2,5,Fry,Decapodian Emperor3988,Decapodian Emperor," Listen, lady, as you can plainly see I'm a highly desirable male, groaning with jelly. Yet I embrace a life of celibacy in order to uphold our crazy traditions. One of your friends must die.
",192,18,2,5,Leela,Bender3989,Bender," Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be.  Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope! Come on, baby!
",160,18,2,5,Decapodian Emperor,Zoidberg3990,Zoidberg," Fry, it's been years since medical school so remind me. Disembowelling in your species: Fatal or non-fatal?
",109,18,2,5,Bender,Fry3991,Fry," Fatal.
",8,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg3992,Zoidberg," Large bet on myself in round one!
",35,18,2,5,Fry,Decapodian Emperor3993,Decapodian Emperor," Edna, have you anything to say before begins the Claw-Plach?
",62,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Edna3994,Edna," I do. I just want to say that today I got up and I had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth--
",100,18,2,5,Decapodian Emperor,Fry3995,Fry,"  Shut up!
",11,18,2,5,Edna,Edna3996,Edna," I love you, Fry!
",18,18,2,5,Fry,Decapodian Emperor3997,Decapodian Emperor," Fry, having guessed what animal I was thinking of, you shall have first choice of weapon.  And you, doctor?
",109,18,2,5,Edna,Zoidberg3998,Zoidberg," I choose my own claws! I want the tactile pleasure of chopping him right here in the gonads!
",94,18,2,5,Decapodian Emperor,Fry3999,Fry," Shh! Nobody correct him!
",26,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Bender4000,Bender," Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but, if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win.
",133,18,2,5,Fry,Fry4001,Fry," But it's a fight to the death!
",32,18,2,5,Bender,Bender4002,Bender," Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!
",48,18,2,5,Fry,Decapodian Emperor4003,Decapodian Emperor," Please rise for the national anthem.
",38,18,2,5,Bender,Fry4004,Fry," Uh-oh.
",8,18,2,5,Decapodian Emperor,Decapodian Emperor4005,Decapodian Emperor,"  Let Claw-Plach begin!
",24,18,2,5,Fry,Fry4006,Fry," Hey!
",6,18,2,5,Decapodian Emperor,Bender4007,Bender," Ow!
",5,18,2,5,Fry,Leela4008,Leela,"  Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!
",34,18,2,5,Bender,Fry4009,Fry," Aha!  Oops!
",13,18,2,5,Leela,Edna4010,Edna,"  Nooo! I can't stand to look.
",31,18,2,5,Fry,Zoidberg4011,Zoidberg," Huh?
",6,18,2,5,Edna,Bender4012,Bender," Psst, Fry. Take a dive.
",25,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Crowd4013,Crowd,"  Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!  Claw-Plach!  Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!
",76,18,2,5,Bender,Fry4014,Fry," My fellow fish monsters, far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or its dumb customs, but is squeezing each other's brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend, and though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why?  One reason.  You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!
",373,18,2,5,Crowd,Leela4015,Leela," Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.
",31,18,2,5,Fry,Zoidberg4016,Zoidberg," Edna? Honey?
",14,18,2,5,Leela,Zoidberg4017,Zoidberg," Edna?
",7,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Leela4018,Leela," Ew!
",5,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Bender4019,Bender," Oh, my God!
",13,18,2,5,Leela,Zoidberg4020,Zoidberg," The frenzy!  Oh, the greatest experience in life and I missed it.
",67,18,2,5,Bender,Fry4021,Fry," Aw. I'm sorry, Doc.
",21,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Fry4022,Fry," Ow, ow! Ah!
",13,18,2,5,Fry,Zoidberg4023,Zoidberg," The frenzy is over. How will I ever get rid of my male jelly now?
",67,18,2,5,Fry,Fry4024,Fry,"  I'll lend you this.
",22,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Leela4025,Leela," Fry!
",6,18,2,5,Fry,Fry4026,Fry," Hey, hey.
",11,18,2,5,Leela,Bender4027,Bender," Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?
",52,18,2,5,Fry,Zoidberg4028,Zoidberg," They come to feast after the frenzy. Once my species passes on its genes, it dies.
",84,18,2,5,Bender,Fry4029,Fry," You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome death?
",78,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg4030,Zoidberg," Yes.
",6,18,2,5,Fry,Fry4031,Fry," Tough call.
",13,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg4032,Zoidberg," Well it was nice of you to let me reattach your arm, Fry, especially after I made a complete eel out of myself.
",113,18,2,5,Fry,Fry4033,Fry," No biggie.
",12,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg4034,Zoidberg," Yes biggie. I learned to feel things I'd never felt before: Love, jealousy, passion for disembowelling. I owe it all to you.  There! I pronounce the operation a success.
",171,18,2,5,Fry,Leela4035,Leela," Hooray!
",9,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Bender4036,Bender," Yeah!
",7,18,2,5,Leela,Fry4037,Fry,"  Yeah!
",8,18,2,5,Bender,Zoidberg4038,Zoidberg," I may not know from emotions but when it comes to medicine, forget about it.
",78,18,2,5,Fry,Fry4039,Fry," I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could take one more whack at this?
",99,18,2,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg4040,Zoidberg," For you, my friend, anything.
",31,18,2,5,Fry,Fry4041,Fry,"  My legs!

",46,19,2,6,Flexo,Fry4160,Fry," I'm telling you, there's something about Flexo I don't like.
",62,19,2,6,Fry,Flexo4161,Flexo," Hey, Fry, think fast.  Get it? It's chlorine!
",47,19,2,6,Fry,Zoidberg4162,Zoidberg," It's funny because it's poisonous!
",36,19,2,6,Flexo,Fry4163,Fry," Yeah, keep laughing, brine shrimp, but he's bad news. I regret ever running him over.
",87,19,2,6,Zoidberg,Hermes4164,Hermes," Take a rage dump, man. He's no worse than Bender.
",51,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4165,Fry," He's much worse. He drinks and smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the Internet.
",90,19,2,6,Hermes,Amy4166,Amy," That's Bender, alright.
",25,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4167,Fry," I'm talking about Flexo.
",26,19,2,6,Amy,Leela4168,Leela," Oh, I get it. This is cute. You're jealous of Bender's new friend!
",68,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4169,Fry," No, I'm not. Mark my words: Flexo's evil. He's the evil Bender.
",65,19,2,6,Leela,Hermes4170,Hermes," Rage dump!
",12,19,2,6,Fry,Farnsworth4171,Farnsworth,"  Good news, everyone. Report to my bedroom for a private exhibition.
",70,19,2,6,Hermes,Farnsworth4172,Farnsworth," Everyone get in bed with me. I have something to show you.  Feast your eyes on this!
",86,19,2,6,Farnsworth,Leela4173,Leela," It's beautiful.
",17,19,2,6,Farnsworth,Amy4174,Amy," And huge.
",11,19,2,6,Leela,Fry4175,Fry," Can I touch it?
",17,19,2,6,Amy,Zoidberg4176,Zoidberg," So what is it, already?
",25,19,2,6,Fry,Farnsworth4177,Farnsworth," It's a single atom of jumbonium, an element so rare the nucleus alone is worth more than $50,000.
",99,19,2,6,Zoidberg,Bender4178,Bender," How much more?
",16,19,2,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth4179,Farnsworth," 100,000. That's why I hid it here, under my mattress.
",55,19,2,6,Bender,Leela4180,Leela," Uh, Professor, can we discuss this somewhere else?
",52,19,2,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth4181,Farnsworth," Why certainly.
",16,19,2,6,Leela,Farnsworth4182,Farnsworth," The atom sits atop this dimestore tiara which will be awarded to the winner of this year's Miss Universe pageant on the planet Tova 9.  Your job is to deliver it, safe and sound.
",180,19,2,6,Farnsworth,Amy4183,Amy," Wow! When I was a little girl on Mars I dreamed of being Miss Universe.
",73,19,2,6,Farnsworth,Leela4184,Leela," That's kinda pathetic.
",24,19,2,6,Amy,Amy4185,Amy," Aw, come on, Leela. Deep down all girls wanna be Miss Universe.
",65,19,2,6,Leela,Leela4186,Leela," Not me.
",9,19,2,6,Amy,Amy4187,Amy," Really? Maybe it's just cute girls.
",37,19,2,6,Leela,Farnsworth4188,Farnsworth," Due to the atoms tremendous value, Planet Express would go bankrupt if it was stolen. Therefore we'll need to hire on additional security for the mission.
",156,19,2,6,Amy,Flexo4189,Flexo," Oh, oh, oh, oh! Mr. Professor, right here!
",44,19,2,6,Farnsworth,Fry4190,Fry," Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great, but--
",87,19,2,6,Flexo,Farnsworth4191,Farnsworth," ""Flexo's great,"" you say? Well that's good enough for me.  Welcome aboard, lad.
",81,19,2,6,Fry,Leela4192,Leela," Space bandidos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
",142,19,2,6,Farnsworth,Fry4193,Fry," Wait, hold on. I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically.
",78,19,2,6,Leela,Leela4194,Leela," OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
",41,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4195,Fry," Wait, let's go by rank.
",25,19,2,6,Leela,Leela4196,Leela," OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
",41,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4197,Fry," Flexo outranks me?
",20,19,2,6,Leela,Flexo4198,Flexo," That's ""Flexo outranks me, sir""!
",34,19,2,6,Fry,Bender4199,Bender," Halt. Who goes there?
",23,19,2,6,Flexo,Fry4200,Fry," Don't point that at me.
",25,19,2,6,Bender,Bender4201,Bender," ""Fry"" who?
",12,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4202,Fry," Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom.
",77,19,2,6,Bender,Bender4203,Bender," My God, Fry! Just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil? Well I got a label for you, pal: An ugly little word called ""prejudice"".
",144,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4204,Fry," I'm not prejudiced.
",21,19,2,6,Bender,Bender4205,Bender," Ah, save it for the cross-burning, Adolf!
",43,19,2,6,Fry,Flexo4206,Flexo," Keeping an eye on the safe?
",29,19,2,6,Bender,Bender4207,Bender," You know it!
",14,19,2,6,Flexo,Flexo4208,Flexo," Well, looks like it's my shift. You lie down and go offline for a while.
",74,19,2,6,Bender,Bender4209,Bender," Alright.
",10,19,2,6,Flexo,Fry4210,Fry," Caught you!  I saw you looking at the atom!
",45,19,2,6,Bender,Flexo4211,Flexo," So? I look at lots of atoms. Shouldn't you be resting up for your shift?
",74,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4212,Fry," Oh-ho, you'd like it if I went to sleep, wouldn't you?
",56,19,2,6,Flexo,Flexo4213,Flexo," Whatever it takes to shut your yapper.  Nah, I'm just kidding, you're a joker.
",80,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4214,Fry," Yeah, well here's a funny joke: I'm gonna sit right here till it's my shift.
",78,19,2,6,Flexo,Flexo4215,Flexo," Suit yourself, skinbag.
",25,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4216,Fry," That I will.
",14,19,2,6,Flexo,Flexo4217,Flexo," Good.
",7,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4218,Fry," Good.
",7,19,2,6,Flexo,Flexo4219,Flexo," Good.
",7,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4220,Fry," Good.
",7,19,2,6,Flexo,Flexo4221,Flexo," Good.
",7,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4222,Fry," Good.  Good.
",14,19,2,6,Flexo,Fry4223,Fry," Well, that's eight hours.
",27,19,2,6,Fry,Flexo4224,Flexo," Yeah, eight hours of solid boredom.  Nah, I'm kidding, you're a wonderful man.
",80,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4225,Fry," Finally, the atom is safe.
",28,19,2,6,Flexo,Leela4226,Leela," What is it?  My God! Did you hear maracas?
",44,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4227,Fry," No.
",5,19,2,6,Leela,Leela4228,Leela," Then it wasn't space bandidos.  Bender, lock down the ship. Don't let Flexo escape.
",85,19,2,6,Fry,Bender4229,Bender," Aye aye, Captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially me ... Bender.
",89,19,2,6,Leela,Leela4230,Leela," How could Flexo have stolen the atom?
",39,19,2,6,Bender,Fry4231,Fry," He must have used a sleep-ray on me. Sleep-rays exist in the future, right?
",77,19,2,6,Leela,Leela4232,Leela," No.
",5,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4233,Fry," Oh. Then I must've fallen asleep.
",35,19,2,6,Leela,Leela4234,Leela," Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil.
",50,19,2,6,Fry,Bender4235,Bender," I locked down the exits but he may have already gotten away.
",62,19,2,6,Leela,Leela4236,Leela," OK, thanks, Bender. Let's fan out and look for him.
",53,19,2,6,Bender,Bender4237,Bender," Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here.
",49,19,2,6,Leela,Leela4238,Leela,"  Keep an eye on Fry. We can't rule out the possibility that he did it.
",72,19,2,6,Bender,Leela4239,Leela," Aha!
",6,19,2,6,Leela,Fry4240,Fry," Aha!  Uh, searching ... hmm.
",30,19,2,6,Leela,Leela4241,Leela," Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?
",61,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4242,Fry," I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.
",80,19,2,6,Leela,Bender4243,Bender," Well, he wasn't in the, uh, kitchen room.
",43,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4244,Fry,"  Say, Bender, can I hold that map for a second?
",49,19,2,6,Bender,Bender4245,Bender," And leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.
",69,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4246,Fry," Give it up!
",13,19,2,6,Bender,Bender4247,Bender," Alright, take it. Sheesh!
",27,19,2,6,Fry,Leela4248,Leela," Well, looks like Flexo got away clean.
",40,19,2,6,Bender,Bender4249,Bender," It's a darn shame.
",20,19,2,6,Leela,Leela4250,Leela," He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed.
",62,19,2,6,Bender,Fry4251,Fry," Or maybe, he never left at all!  Wait a minute. You're Bender.
",64,19,2,6,Leela,Bender4252,Bender," Of course, who said I wasn't?
",31,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4253,Fry," But why were you wearing that scarf and the turtleneck and this fruity number?
",80,19,2,6,Bender,Bender4254,Bender," It's a little thing called ""style"". Look it up sometime.
",58,19,2,6,Fry,Barker4255,Barker," Our ninth finalist, Miss Methane Planet, Halatina Smogmeyer.  And our tenth and final finalist, Miss Earth's Moon, The Crushinator.
",133,19,2,6,Bender,Crushinator4256,Crushinator,"  Thank you, Bob Barker. I'm as happy as a girl can be. End statement.
",71,19,2,6,Barker,Barker4257,Barker," Which one of these lovely womanoids will take home the atomic tiara?

",53,19,2,6,Leela,Barker4260,Barker," So you lost the atom, huh? You're garbage, human garbage! Do you brain-dead space jockeys have any idea how much that thing is worth?
",135,19,2,6,Barker,Fry4261,Fry," 100,000?
",10,19,2,6,Barker,Leela4262,Leela," 200,000?
",10,19,2,6,Fry,Bender4263,Bender," 200,001?
",10,19,2,6,Leela,Barker4264,Barker,"  You're closest without going over.
",37,19,2,6,Bender,Fry4265,Fry," Well, uh, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you received the atom.
",93,19,2,6,Barker,Barker4266,Barker," I'm not signing squat. You find me that damn tiara before the pageant ends.
",77,19,2,6,Fry,Leela4267,Leela," But, Mr. Barker--
",19,19,2,6,Barker,Barker4268,Barker," Enough out of you. I may be against the fur industry, but that won't stop me from skinning you alive! As long as no one wears the skin.
",137,19,2,6,Leela,Leela4269,Leela," Well, gentlemen, it appears we're boned.
",42,19,2,6,Barker,Fry4270,Fry," Flexo!

",45,19,2,6,Amazonian,Bender4281,Bender," Aw, jeez.
",11,19,2,6,Leela,Fry4282,Fry," Bender? You stole the atom?
",29,19,2,6,Bender,Bender4283,Bender," Yeah, but I can explain, it's very valuable.
",46,19,2,6,Fry,Flexo4284,Flexo," I saw him snatch it while Fry was asleep. That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker.
",80,19,2,6,Bender,Fry4285,Fry," Whoa, whoa, wait a second. You mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked. Shocked! Well not that shocked.
",110,19,2,6,Flexo,Leela4286,Leela," I'm sorry we suspected you, Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and all--
",77,19,2,6,Fry,Flexo4287,Flexo," Don't even bother. You people sicken me. I put my life on the line to guard that atom and this is how you repay me? Well you can go rot for all I care.  Nah, I'm just kidding, you guys are alright.
",199,19,2,6,Leela,Fry4288,Fry," I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?
",147,19,2,6,Flexo,Bender4289,Bender," Eh, they're both fine choices. Whatever floats your boat.
",59,19,2,6,Fry,URL4290,URL," Is this the guy?
",18,19,2,6,Bender,Barker4291,Barker," Huh? Oh, yeah, that looks like him. Whatever.
",47,19,2,6,URL,Flexo4292,Flexo," Wait, but I--
",15,19,2,6,Barker,Barker4293,Barker," Take him away.
",16,19,2,6,Flexo,Barker4294,Barker," Alright, let's put an end to this pathetic hoedown. Brannigan, read the thing.
",80,19,2,6,Barker,Zapp4295,Zapp," And the winner is...
",22,19,2,6,Barker,Leela4296,Leela," It figures. Who else but Zapp Brannigan would be judging the most chauvinistic, degrading, dehumanising--
",107,19,2,6,Zapp,Zapp4297,Zapp," Huh? Leela?
",13,19,2,6,Leela,Leela4298,Leela," Wait, you're making a--  Ooh! Look at that.  I feel like a princess!
",70,19,2,6,Zapp,Zapp4299,Zapp," Wait. What are you people? Idiots? I'm still going mano a mano with this envelope.  And the winner is: Miss Vega 4.   There it is, Miss Universe. There it is, looking weird.
",175,19,2,6,Leela,Leela4300,Leela," I almost had that tiara.
",26,19,2,6,Zapp,Bender4301,Bender," Me too.
",9,19,2,6,Leela,Fry4302,Fry," Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet.
",108,19,2,6,Bender,Leela4303,Leela," Fry, that's a radiator.
",25,19,2,6,Fry,Fry4304,Fry," Oh.  Is there a burn ward within 10 feet of here?

",106,20,2,7,Malfunctioning Eddie,Bender4309,Bender," Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing.  The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision.
",138,20,2,7,Amy,Fry4310,Fry," No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately.
",66,20,2,7,Bender,Leela4311,Leela," I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender.
",37,20,2,7,Fry,Victor4312,Victor," Hello, I am Victor and I know many things about the art of unloading fine cars on beautiful women.

",52,20,2,7,Victor,Victor4314,Victor," Ah-ah-ah! A gentleman always sells a lady a car first.  This is the Beta Romeo. Yes, the Beta Romeo. Note the cross-your-heart seat belt which protects, lifts and separates.
",175,20,2,7,Leela,Thundercougarfalconbird salesman4315,Thundercougarfalconbird salesman," Spotted her the minute you walked in, didn't you, sir? She's a real beauty.
",77,20,2,7,Victor,Fry4316,Fry," Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright.
",38,20,2,7,Thundercougarfalconbird salesman,Salesman #14317,Salesman #1," No, the Ford Thundercougarfalconbird!  Nothing makes you feel more like a man than a Thundercougarfalconbird. So how much were you thinking of spending on this Thundercougarfalconbird?
",186,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4318,Fry," Sorry, I'm not here to buy.
",29,20,2,7,Salesman #1,Salesman #14319,Salesman #1," I understand, and it's wonderful you don't care whether anyone questions your sexual orientation.
",99,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4320,Fry," I care! I care plenty! I just don't know how to make them stop!
",65,20,2,7,Salesman #1,Salesman #14321,Salesman #1," One word: Thundercougarfalconbird!
",36,20,2,7,Fry,Victor4322,Victor," The luxurious seats are stuffed with eagle down and the dashboard inlaid with the beaks of a thousand eagles. Also, there are some eagles under the floorboards.
",162,20,2,7,Salesman #1,Amy4323,Amy," That's an awful lot of eagle.
",31,20,2,7,Victor,Victor4324,Victor," Yes, and yet--
",16,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4325,Amy," What's wrong?
",15,20,2,7,Victor,Victor4326,Victor," It is just ... the luxury edition has so much more eagle. It saddens me to think of you missing out.
",102,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4327,Amy," Oh, don't be sad. My parents are paying and they're incredibly rich.

",101,20,2,7,Mechanic,Mechanic4330,Mechanic," Alright. But sooner or later that ass is gonna blow, and when it does, I just pray you're not moonin' someone you care about.
",127,20,2,7,Bender,Amy4331,Amy," Smeesh, Leela! This car has everything a beautiful woman like me needs. Victor said so.
",89,20,2,7,Mechanic,Victor4332,Victor,"  No dog food for Victor tonight.
",34,20,2,7,Amy,Leela4333,Leela," OK, the sticker says 55,000, but we'll only go as high as, say--
",66,20,2,7,Victor,Amy4334,Amy," 60,000!
",9,20,2,7,Leela,Victor4335,Victor," Oh, I will have to ask my manager.
",36,20,2,7,Amy,Leela4336,Leela," Amy, you don't go up from the sticker price.

",20,20,2,7,Victor,Amy4340,Amy," Uh-oh. I'm terrible at parallel parking.
",42,20,2,7,Amy,Hermes4341,Hermes,"  And now you're asking for a day off? Get out of my and my sight!  You're bogarting my patience.
",98,20,2,7,Amy,Leela4342,Leela," Hermes, who were you yelling at?
",34,20,2,7,Hermes,Hermes4343,Hermes," Myself. I asked myself a Valentine's Day off, but I was in no mood for any of my shenanigans.
",95,20,2,7,Leela,Fry4344,Fry," Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well, since neither of us has a date, why don't we...?
",128,20,2,7,Hermes,Leela4345,Leela," You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?
",49,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4346,Fry," Shall we say eight o'clock?
",29,20,2,7,Leela,Amy4347,Amy," Hey, I'm taking my new car out for a spin to Mercury. Anybody wanna come?
",75,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4348,Fry," Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?
",36,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4349,Amy," The usual: Boiling lead, oceans of lava.
",42,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4350,Fry," So, what? Shorts?
",19,20,2,7,Amy,Fry4351,Fry," Boy, this A.C. is incredible!  I'd better turn on the heater too.   Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more.
",140,20,2,7,Fry,Amy4352,Amy,"  Hey, how about some icy margaritas?
",38,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4353,Fry,"  Yeah!  We're slowing down!
",29,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4354,Amy,"  Don't worry. I'll hit the fuel guzzler!
",42,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4355,Fry,"  Who wants pop-tarts?  Uh-oh!
",31,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4356,Amy," It's OK, I have an emergency phone.
",37,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4357,Fry," What are you doing?
",21,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4358,Amy," Spluh! It's a video-phone.  Lucky I'm a member of the Astro-Afro-Antarctico-Amer-Asian Auto Association.  Hello? Septuple-A?
",126,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4359,Fry," Phew!
",7,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4360,Amy," It'll be a couple hours. Oh, I'm gonna get sweat on my sweat-suit.
",68,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4361,Fry," Hey, tell me something: You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
",110,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4362,Amy," I guess 'cause my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike.  As though!
",76,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4363,Fry," I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?
",103,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4364,Amy," Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, ""Straighten your Pope hat,"" and, ""Put on your good vestments.""  You know, Fry, it's nice to find someone I can talk to about stuff, and junk.
",189,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4365,Fry," Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever.
",74,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4366,Amy," So while they're towin' us, you wanna do it?
",46,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4367,Fry," Yeah.
",7,20,2,7,Amy,Hermes4368,Hermes," Which concludes the summary of the movie I saw last night. Now, any old business?
",83,20,2,7,Fry,All4369,All,"  No.
",6,20,2,7,Hermes,Hermes4370,Hermes," Any new business?
",19,20,2,7,All,All4371,All,"  No.
",6,20,2,7,Hermes,Hermes4372,Hermes," Anyone spend the night together?
",34,20,2,7,All,Amy4373,Amy," Yep.
",6,20,2,7,Hermes,Fry4374,Fry," Kind of.
",10,20,2,7,Amy,Bender4375,Bender," What?
",7,20,2,7,Fry,Hermes4376,Hermes," Oh, my God!
",13,20,2,7,Bender,Amy4377,Amy," We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another.
",61,20,2,7,Hermes,Fry4378,Fry," And it led there again when we got home.
",42,20,2,7,Amy,Bender4379,Bender," Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics.
",113,20,2,7,Fry,Leela4380,Leela," Bender! Romance isn't about money.
",36,20,2,7,Bender,Bender4381,Bender," Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!
",102,20,2,7,Leela,Leela4382,Leela," For your information, it's because he's hideous.
",50,20,2,7,Bender,Hermes4383,Hermes," Well I think Amy and Fry go together like a lime and coconut.
",63,20,2,7,Leela,Farnsworth4384,Farnsworth," Do I hear wedding bells?
",26,20,2,7,Hermes,Fry4385,Fry," What? No!
",11,20,2,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth4386,Farnsworth," Really? Oh, dear.
",19,20,2,7,Fry,Zoidberg4387,Zoidberg," You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness. If only I weren't so desperately poor.
",113,20,2,7,Farnsworth,Bender4388,Bender," Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--
",114,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Judge #14389,Judge #1," $500 and time served.
",23,20,2,7,Bender,Bender4390,Bender," Stupid anti-pimping laws!  Well, pay the man!
",47,20,2,7,Judge #1,Hookerbot4391,Hookerbot," Bender, honey, we love you!
",29,20,2,7,Bender,Bender4392,Bender," Shut up, baby, I know it!
",27,20,2,7,Hookerbot,Bender4393,Bender," Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase ""upside your head"".
",98,20,2,7,Bender,Leela4394,Leela," Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?
",73,20,2,7,Bender,Bender4395,Bender," Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!
",41,20,2,7,Leela,Hermes4396,Hermes,"  Fry! Amy! Put your pants back on! I need a stapler.
",54,20,2,7,Bender,Zoidberg4397,Zoidberg," Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged and maul us with his fearsome gonad.
",113,20,2,7,Hermes,Fry4398,Fry,"  It's working, they think we're making out.  Wait, why aren't we making out?
",78,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Amy4399,Amy," I 'unno.
",10,20,2,7,Fry,Bender4400,Bender," OK, Mister...?
",16,20,2,7,Amy,Zapp4401,Zapp," Uh, Smith! Zapp Smith. Uh, Brannigan.
",39,20,2,7,Bender,Bender4402,Bender," Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner.
",65,20,2,7,Zapp,Zapp4403,Zapp," Let's see ... Oh, yes!  Yes, definitely.  Oh, I'd like some of that.  Mmm, I'll just have everything on the menu.
",115,20,2,7,Bender,Bender4404,Bender," Now to run it through our high-speed romance-a-logical data-fier.  Say hello to Miss Right!
",93,20,2,7,Zapp,Zapp4405,Zapp,"  Hello!
",9,20,2,7,Bender,Fry4406,Fry," Wow! We're great kissers!
",27,20,2,7,Zapp,Amy4407,Amy," Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out to Europa? We could have a picnic and spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter.
",111,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4408,Fry," Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk.
",122,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4409,Amy," Yeah. Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging out with you.
",56,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4410,Fry," Everything was going great. Then, all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hanging out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela.
",161,20,2,7,Amy,Leela4411,Leela," You'll be back to zero soon enough.
",37,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4412,Fry," Don't you get it? She's smothering me.
",40,20,2,7,Leela,Amy4413,Amy," Hi.
",5,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4414,Fry," You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.
",60,20,2,7,Amy,Leela4415,Leela," Fry--
",7,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4416,Fry," I'm doing my job, there's Amy; I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine, there's Amy; I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy, there's Amy!
",161,20,2,7,Leela,Leela4417,Leela," I think you're over reacting.
",31,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4418,Fry," Am I?  Am I?  Face it, I'm a prize catch.  I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money.
",89,20,2,7,Leela,Leela4419,Leela," Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money.
",55,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4420,Fry," Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us. I can't be alone with her.
",108,20,2,7,Leela,Amy4421,Amy," So, ready for a secluded picnic with just you and me?
",55,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4422,Fry," Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me?  Uh, Dr. Zoidberg.
",83,20,2,7,Amy,Zoidberg4423,Zoidberg," Did someone say something about a free hot meal?
",50,20,2,7,Fry,Zoidberg4424,Zoidberg," Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! Bird eggs, animal slices ...  ... dry woven reeds!  All gone! Can I drive?
",112,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Amy4425,Amy," No. So, Fry, you busy tomorrow? I got two tickets to the big ape fight.
",73,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Fry4426,Fry," Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?
",84,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4427,Amy," OK, sure. What do you wanna do for Valentine's Day?
",53,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4428,Fry," Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?
",65,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4429,Amy," But you just said--
",21,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4430,Fry," That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive.
",55,20,2,7,Amy,Zoidberg4431,Zoidberg," Wahoo!
",8,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4432,Fry,"  Pardon me, excuse me.
",24,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Zoidberg4433,Zoidberg," Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!
",51,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4434,Fry," Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?
",131,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Amy4435,Amy," Huh? You don't like chocolate?
",32,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4436,Fry," Look, could chocolate just let me finish?
",43,20,2,7,Amy,Zoidberg4437,Zoidberg," Vroom, vroom! And the winner of the big car race is ... Hot Rod Zoidberg!
",75,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4438,Fry," Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--
",71,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Zoidberg4439,Zoidberg," Uh-oh. Here, you drive!
",25,20,2,7,Fry,Zoidberg4440,Zoidberg," Fry? Are you alright?
",23,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Fry4441,Fry," Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?
",61,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Zoidberg4442,Zoidberg," No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody but you. I'm afraid your body was badly damaged in the crash.
",105,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4443,Fry," How badly?
",12,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Zoidberg4444,Zoidberg," That's it over there.  Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive with some quick surgery.
",96,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4445,Fry," Where is it?
",14,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Zoidberg4446,Zoidberg," There.
",8,20,2,7,Fry,Amy4447,Amy," Looks like we'll be spending a lot more time together, Fry!
",61,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Leela4448,Leela," This sort of thing always happens with office romances.
",57,20,2,7,Amy,Zoidberg4449,Zoidberg," Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days.  Upsy daisy!
",81,20,2,7,Leela,Fry4450,Fry," Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much.
",63,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Amy4451,Amy," Fry!
",6,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4452,Fry," Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm.
",41,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4453,Amy," So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?
",68,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4454,Fry," Oh, that.  Maybe we'd better talk in private.  I'll meet you in the closet.
",77,20,2,7,Amy,Fry4455,Fry," Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together.
",89,20,2,7,Fry,Amy4456,Amy," You're breaking up with me?
",29,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4457,Fry," I just think we should start seeing other people.
",51,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4458,Amy," But, I was really having fun.  If that's how you feel.
",56,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4459,Fry," I'm sorry, but it is.
",23,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4460,Amy," Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long as we're not seeing each other, you mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's Day?
",126,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4461,Fry," Huh?
",6,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4462,Amy," I mean, unless it would make you feel bad, being a third wheel.
",65,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4463,Fry," Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!
",82,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4464,Amy," With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman.
",64,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4465,Fry,"  Oh!  Oh!
",11,20,2,7,Amy,Leela4466,Leela," So, how's business?
",21,20,2,7,Fry,Bender4467,Bender," Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' you, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day.
",111,20,2,7,Leela,Leela4468,Leela," Yeah, it's pathetic alright!  How much?
",41,20,2,7,Bender,Bender4469,Bender," 500 bucks.
",12,20,2,7,Leela,Leela4470,Leela," Done.
",7,20,2,7,Bender,Bender4471,Bender," Zapp Brannigan OK?
",20,20,2,7,Leela,Leela4472,Leela," No!
",5,20,2,7,Bender,Bender4473,Bender," 600.
",6,20,2,7,Leela,Fry4474,Fry," Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute?  In private?
",66,20,2,7,Bender,Amy4475,Amy," Oh, no problem.
",17,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4476,Fry," This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?
",146,20,2,7,Amy,Leela4477,Leela," You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!
",113,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4478,Fry," Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.
",110,20,2,7,Leela,Leela4479,Leela," Bender's in his office.
",25,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4480,Fry," Thanks.
",9,20,2,7,Leela,Bender4481,Bender," I got your hook-up, Fry. Now, my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance.
",110,20,2,7,Fry,Amy4482,Amy," OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra.
",41,20,2,7,Bender,Fry4483,Fry," Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?
",111,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4484,Amy," What business is it of yours?
",31,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4485,Fry," And another thing: You're using an awful lot of make-up there.
",64,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4486,Amy," This is deodorant.
",20,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4487,Fry," What does it do?
",18,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4488,Amy,"  C'mon in, Gary! I'll just be another 20 minutes.
",51,20,2,7,Fry,Gary4489,Gary,"  I'll be waiting.
",19,20,2,7,Amy,Fry4490,Fry," 20 minutes? You're practically ready now!
",43,20,2,7,Gary,Amy4491,Amy," Yeah, but it's good to make them wait a little.
",49,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4492,Fry," Oh, God, it's true!
",21,20,2,7,Amy,Gary4493,Gary," That dress looks great on you.
",32,20,2,7,Fry,Amy4494,Amy,"  Thanks.
",10,20,2,7,Gary,Fry4495,Fry,"  Thanks.  Where is she?
",25,20,2,7,Amy,Gary4496,Gary," I must say, Amy, you're all made up, just like Fry's date. Get it?
",68,20,2,7,Fry,Amy4497,Amy," Mm-mm.
",8,20,2,7,Gary,Fry4498,Fry," I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.
",46,20,2,7,Amy,Bender4499,Bender," Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!
",55,20,2,7,Fry,Petunia4500,Petunia," How's them eats?
",18,20,2,7,Bender,Fry4501,Fry," Uh--
",6,20,2,7,Petunia,Petunia4502,Petunia," Don't mind if I do.  Kids'll be hungry.
",41,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4503,Fry,"  She seems a little old for me.
",33,20,2,7,Petunia,Bender4504,Bender," She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!
",60,20,2,7,Fry,Petunia4505,Petunia," Wheels fell off my house.
",27,20,2,7,Bender,Bender4506,Bender," Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!
",54,20,2,7,Petunia,Gary4507,Gary," I'll take one.
",16,20,2,7,Bender,Fry4508,Fry," Oh, yeah? Well I want one too.
",32,20,2,7,Gary,Bender4509,Bender," Eight bucks.
",14,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4510,Fry," But you just said--
",21,20,2,7,Bender,Bender4511,Bender," Demand suddenly skyrocketed. You all saw it!
",46,20,2,7,Fry,Bender4512,Bender," Leela, meet your future husband Sal.
",38,20,2,7,Bender,Sal4513,Sal," Nice eyeball, eyeball.
",24,20,2,7,Bender,Leela4514,Leela," Nice ass, ass.
",16,20,2,7,Sal,Bender4515,Bender," Ooh, sparks!  Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!
",59,20,2,7,Leela,Sal4516,Sal," Eh, I'll take my chances.
",27,20,2,7,Bender,Zapp4517,Zapp," Cheers!
",9,20,2,7,Sal,Woman #14518,Woman #1," Cheers!
",9,20,2,7,Zapp,Petunia4519,Petunia," So tell me about your prospects. You a good gambler?
",54,20,2,7,Woman #1,Fry4520,Fry," Well, ma'am, I--
",18,20,2,7,Petunia,Petunia4521,Petunia," What's your game? Bingo? Keno? Wait a minute! You don't have your own body.
",77,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4522,Fry," No, but I control this arm.
",29,20,2,7,Petunia,Petunia4523,Petunia," Slots player, huh? Sorry, but I think I can do better.
",56,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4524,Fry," Wait, come back, uh, darling.
",31,20,2,7,Petunia,Petunia4525,Petunia," Can't, hon', I gotta catch my bus back to Nutley. I'd kiss you goodnight but I lost my teeth pulling out a stump.
",115,20,2,7,Fry,Sal4526,Sal," So anyways, Leela, I'd love to take a whack at ya but thatto Nutley ain't goin' nowheres without yours truly behinds the wheel.
",129,20,2,7,Petunia,Petunia4527,Petunia," Excuse me, did you say to Nutley""?
",36,20,2,7,Sal,Sal4528,Sal," Why, yes I dids.
",18,20,2,7,Petunia,Leela4529,Leela,"  Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?
",62,20,2,7,Sal,Bender4530,Bender," Of course not.
",16,20,2,7,Leela,Sal4531,Sal,"  Anybodys else for Nutley?
",28,20,2,7,Bender,Zapp4532,Zapp," Baby, wait! You didn't show me your surprise.
",47,20,2,7,Sal,Gary4533,Gary,"  You know what I'd like to do...?
",35,20,2,7,Zapp,Fry4534,Fry," Oh, jeez, get a room!
",23,20,2,7,Gary,Gary4535,Gary," Maybe later.
",14,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4536,Fry," Hey, I have an idea: Let's all go out for ice cream.
",54,20,2,7,Gary,Gary4537,Gary," Actually, I thought Amy might like to come back to my place for coffee.
",73,20,2,7,Fry,Amy4538,Amy," I don't really like coffee.
",29,20,2,7,Gary,Gary4539,Gary," Neither do I.
",15,20,2,7,Amy,Amy4540,Amy," Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!
",29,20,2,7,Gary,Gary4541,Gary," Let me pick up the check.
",27,20,2,7,Amy,Fry4542,Fry," Nooo!  That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here.  Ooh! Ow!
",61,20,2,7,Gary,Leela4543,Leela," Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body: Fry.
",56,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4544,Fry," Oh, Leela!
",12,20,2,7,Leela,Amy4545,Amy," We were just on our way out.
",30,20,2,7,Fry,Leela4546,Leela," Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?
",71,20,2,7,Amy,Gary4547,Gary," I'm a banking industry regulator.
",35,20,2,7,Leela,Leela4548,Leela," Really? Y'know, I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple.
",83,20,2,7,Gary,Gary4549,Gary," Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern banking regulations are a product of five different regulatory traditions. Six if you wanna get technical.
",149,20,2,7,Leela,Leela4550,Leela," Oh, I do.
",11,20,2,7,Gary,Gary4551,Gary," It all began in 1410 when a number of noblemen convened...
",60,20,2,7,Leela,Fry4552,Fry,"  Thank you.
",13,20,2,7,Gary,Zoidberg4553,Zoidberg," There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin. I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash.
",104,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4554,Fry," Can I live without it?
",24,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Zoidberg4555,Zoidberg," If you call that living.
",26,20,2,7,Fry,Farnsworth4556,Farnsworth," I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your chest. To crush those who disobey you.  But I guess we're just two different people.
",166,20,2,7,Zoidberg,Fry4557,Fry," So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff.
",100,20,2,7,Farnsworth,Amy4558,Amy," It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel lonely I can just look over at this disfiguring scar and think of you.
",111,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4559,Fry," Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back.
",51,20,2,7,Amy,Leela4560,Leela," So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?
",51,20,2,7,Fry,Fry4561,Fry," Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender.  Ow! Cool!  Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night.
",112,20,2,7,Leela,Leela4562,Leela," Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.
",51,20,2,7,Fry,Bender4563,Bender," Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender.
",61,20,2,7,Leela,Leela4564,Leela," Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.
",107,20,2,7,Bender,Bender4565,Bender," Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?
",28,20,2,7,Leela,Leela4566,Leela," No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!
",97,20,2,7,Bender,Bender4567,Bender," True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?
",76,20,2,7,Leela,Leela4568,Leela," Yeah.
",7,20,2,7,Bender,Fry4569,Fry," I guess so.  Watch the neck! Watch the neck!
",46,20,2,7,Leela,Bender4570,Bender," My ass! My beautiful ass!
",27,20,2,7,Fry,Farnsworth4571,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. I've taught the toaster to feel love.  And Hermes returns from his vacation today.
",105,21,2,8,Bender,Hermes4572,Hermes,"  Good morning, people.
",24,21,2,8,Farnsworth,Fry4573,Fry," Hey, Hermes!
",14,21,2,8,Hermes,Zoidberg4574,Zoidberg," Hello!
",8,21,2,8,Fry,Leela4575,Leela," Good to see you.

",5,21,2,8,Leela,Bender4577,Bender," My man!
",9,21,2,8,Farnsworth,Amy4578,Amy," So how was the Spleef Nebula?
",31,21,2,8,Bender,Hermes4579,Hermes,"  The flight had a stopover on the Brain Slug Planet. Hermes liked it so much he decided to stay of his own free will.
",119,21,2,8,Amy,Fry4580,Fry," Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!
",75,21,2,8,Hermes,Leela4581,Leela,"  Shh! You're gonna get us all assimilated!
",44,21,2,8,Fry,Amy4582,Amy,"  Just act normal and switch to a garlic shampoo.
",50,21,2,8,Leela,Hermes4583,Hermes,"  On to new business. Today's mission is for all of you to go to the Brain Slug Planet.
",88,21,2,8,Amy,Zoidberg4584,Zoidberg," What are we going to do there?
",32,21,2,8,Hermes,Hermes4585,Hermes,"  Just walk around not wearing a helmet.
",41,21,2,8,Zoidberg,Farnsworth4586,Farnsworth," Sounds great, Hermes! Whatever you say.   Let's ditch him and go to the movies!
",81,21,2,8,Hermes,Fry4587,Fry," Hey, yeah!
",12,21,2,8,Farnsworth,Zoidberg4588,Zoidberg," I'm seeing a movie with friends!
",34,21,2,8,Fry,Fry4589,Fry," Cool! Let's see this one!
",27,21,2,8,Zoidberg,Leela4590,Leela," Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good things about Quizblorg, Quizblorg.
",107,21,2,8,Fry,Amy4591,Amy," Guk! I hate subtitles. Alien films are so pretentious.
",56,21,2,8,Leela,Zoidberg4592,Zoidberg," Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams.  It's about an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam.
",140,21,2,8,Amy,Bender4593,Bender," Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits: The Movie.
",61,21,2,8,Zoidberg,Fry4594,Fry," Yeah, I wanna see that.
",25,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4595,Bender," Good point, Bender.
",21,21,2,8,Fry,Fry4596,Fry," I'll take a small Slurm.
",26,21,2,8,Bender,Refreshment-bot4597,Refreshment-bot," For only 25 cents less, you can get a super-small.
",52,21,2,8,Fry,Fry4598,Fry," Uh, OK.  Oh, man!
",19,21,2,8,Refreshment-bot,Bender4599,Bender," Hey, gimme a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil.

",10,21,2,8,Bender,Farnsworth4637,Farnsworth," Aw. They don't make movies like this anymore.
",47,21,2,8,Flabby,Bender4638,Bender," I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine!
",121,21,2,8,Farnsworth,Amy4639,Amy," Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal form of competition in the galaxy!
",105,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4640,Bender," It is?
",8,21,2,8,Amy,Farnsworth4641,Farnsworth," There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner.
",124,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4642,Bender," Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
",34,21,2,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth4643,Farnsworth," Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely.
",94,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4644,Bender," Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.
",73,21,2,8,Farnsworth,Leela4645,Leela," No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is.
",59,21,2,8,Bender,Fry4646,Fry," Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?
",76,21,2,8,Leela,Leela4647,Leela," This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about pride. Let me tell you a story from my childhood.
",123,21,2,8,Fry,Zoidberg4648,Zoidberg," Oh, again with the orphanarium!
",33,21,2,8,Leela,Leela4649,Leela," When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot.
",66,21,2,8,Zoidberg,Leela4650,Leela,"  My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu.
",39,21,2,8,Leela,Fnog4651,Fnog," Excellent. Bill, Keith, you will go to Junior Championships. Bill, congratulate Keith when he regains consciousness.
",118,21,2,8,Leela,Leela4652,Leela," But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed.
",63,21,2,8,Fnog,Fnog4653,Fnog," Perhaps. But there is more to winning than beating your opponent. You lack the will of the warrior.
",101,21,2,8,Leela,Leela4654,Leela," What do you mean? Watch this!
",31,21,2,8,Fnog,Bill4655,Bill,"  Ow!
",6,21,2,8,Leela,Fnog4656,Fnog," No girl has the will of a warrior. You have the will of a housewife or, at best, the schoolmarm.
",98,21,2,8,Bill,Leela4657,Leela," That's it. I'll take you on right now.
",40,21,2,8,Fnog,Fnog4658,Fnog," Very well. But, you see, I have the will of the warrior. Therefore, the battle is already over. The winner? Me!  Rematch? You lose again! Had enough? I thought so!
",165,21,2,8,Leela,Leela4659,Leela," I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours.
",70,21,2,8,Fnog,Bender4660,Bender," Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back in!
",73,21,2,8,Leela,Leela4661,Leela," Let's see what you got. Touch your toes.
",42,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4662,Bender," Still ... can't ... reach!
",28,21,2,8,Leela,Bender4663,Bender," Let's commence preparations for rumbling!
",43,21,2,8,Bender,Referee4664,Referee," Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars, welcome to tonight's main event. In this corner, from Mom's Friendly Robot Factory in America's heartland, Mexico: Bender!  And in this corner, from and made of Parts Unknown: The Clearcutter!
",229,21,2,8,Bender,Fry4665,Fry,"  Bender rules!
",16,21,2,8,Referee,Hermes4666,Hermes,"  I got you an official Bender hat.
",36,21,2,8,Fry,Fry4667,Fry," Wow! Thanks, Hermes!  I-- Hey! Cut that out!
",46,21,2,8,Hermes,Bender4668,Bender," You can't hit what you can't see!
",35,21,2,8,Fry,Leela4669,Leela," Get up, Bender. You can't quit every time you get an axe in the back.  Or a drill through your face. Now quit scratching your axe-hole and get out there.
",155,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4670,Bender," Huh?
",6,21,2,8,Leela,Referee4671,Referee," And the winner is ... Bender!
",31,21,2,8,Bender,Doubledeal4672,Doubledeal," Nice work out there, kid.
",27,21,2,8,Referee,Bender4673,Bender," Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!
",52,21,2,8,Doubledeal,Clearcutter4674,Clearcutter," Hi, boss. Yo, dude!
",21,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4675,Bender," Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?
",42,21,2,8,Clearcutter,Doubledeal4676,Doubledeal," What, you didn't read the pamphlet? Ultimate Robot Fighting's a scam, kid. It's rigged.  It's a secret, so keep it under your head, but the most popular robot always wins.
",173,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4677,Bender," You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?
",66,21,2,8,Doubledeal,Doubledeal4678,Doubledeal," Bingo!
",8,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4679,Bender," Woo-hoo! I'm popular!
",23,21,2,8,Doubledeal,Doubledeal4680,Doubledeal," In fact, you're more than popular, you're pure lowest common denominator.
",75,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4681,Bender," Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
",34,21,2,8,Doubledeal,Referee4682,Referee," Presenting Bender the Offender!
",33,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4683,Bender," I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back.
",64,21,2,8,Referee,Referee4684,Referee," Versus ... Billionairebot!
",28,21,2,8,Bender,Referee4685,Referee," Versus: The Foreigner!
",24,21,2,8,Referee,Foreigner4686,Foreigner," I'm not from here! I have my own customs! Look at my crazy passport!
",70,21,2,8,Referee,Referee4687,Referee," Versus ... The Chain Smoker!
",30,21,2,8,Foreigner,Chain Smoker4688,Chain Smoker," I love smoking. And after I win the fight I'm heading straight to your favourite restaurant.
",94,21,2,8,Referee,Bender4689,Bender," You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover.
",45,21,2,8,Chain Smoker,Leela4690,Leela," Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both of us worked so hard.
",106,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4691,Bender," What do you mean, ""we""?
",25,21,2,8,Leela,Leela4692,Leela," I said ""us"".
",14,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4693,Bender," Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody!
",86,21,2,8,Leela,Fembot #1 #14694,Fembot #1 #1," What about us, Mr. The Offender?
",34,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4695,Bender," Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!
",45,21,2,8,Fembot #1 #1,Bender4696,Bender," Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud?
",87,21,2,8,Bender,Doubledeal4697,Doubledeal," Actually, we've decided to go in a different direction.
",57,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4698,Bender," What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?
",72,21,2,8,Doubledeal,Doubledeal4699,Doubledeal," Bender, your popularity is slipping.
",38,21,2,8,Bender,Foreigner4700,Foreigner," Sales of your Bender Brand French milk bath soaps are down 20%.
",65,21,2,8,Doubledeal,Bender4701,Bender," Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!
",49,21,2,8,Foreigner,Doubledeal4702,Doubledeal," Damnit, Bender! If you can't move sandalwood, you don't belong in this league! That's why you're gonna lose next week's title match.
",134,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4703,Bender," But the crowd loves me.
",25,21,2,8,Doubledeal,Doubledeal4704,Doubledeal," Perhaps. But let's see how they feel about your new persona: The Gender Bender.
",81,21,2,8,Bender,Billionairebot4705,Billionairebot," You'll be the most unpopular robot fighter since Sergeant Faeces Processor.
",77,21,2,8,Doubledeal,Bender4706,Bender," Oh, yeah?  Well what if I don't let the new guy win?
",54,21,2,8,Billionairebot,Doubledeal4707,Doubledeal," Then he'll just have to beat you the old-fashioned way: To death!  Melissa, send in the new kid.
",98,21,2,8,Bender,Destructor4708,Destructor," I am Destructor!
",18,21,2,8,Doubledeal,Bender4709,Bender,"  See you at the fight.
",24,21,2,8,Destructor,Bender4710,Bender," So then I said, ""See you at the fight."" And that's the story.
",63,21,2,8,Bender,Fry4711,Fry," Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing.
",112,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4712,Bender," It's one thing to win a fixed fight; there's dignity in that. But to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win.
",147,21,2,8,Fry,Leela4713,Leela," No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should I give it to you now when you do need it?
",116,21,2,8,Bender,Farnsworth4714,Farnsworth," What the hell are you talking about?
",38,21,2,8,Leela,Leela4715,Leela," I don't know. But I'm not helping.
",36,21,2,8,Farnsworth,Announcer #14716,Announcer #1,"  You loved him as Bender the Offender! Now get ready to hate him as he threatens your sexuality in his new persona ... The Gender Bender!
",139,21,2,8,Leela,Bender4717,Bender,"  I'm a real toughie!
",22,21,2,8,Announcer #1,Announcer #14718,Announcer #1,"  Squaring off this Sunday versus Destructor!
",46,21,2,8,Bender,Destructor4719,Destructor,"  I will destroy you!  And stop calling me!
",44,21,2,8,Announcer #1,Fnog4720,Fnog,"  I am Destructor's trainer, Master Fnog. My pupil will be victorious for he has the will of a warrior!
",104,21,2,8,Destructor,Leela4721,Leela," Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like a girl!
",80,21,2,8,Fnog,Bender4722,Bender,"  I'll put on my tutu!
",23,21,2,8,Leela,Cosell4723,Cosell," Hello and welcome to a remarkable championship bout. Destructor, a robotic armoured tank, whose very use at battle has been ruled a war crime, versus Gender Bender, who wears a pink tutu.  This is Rich Little, imitating Howard Cosell, here at ringside with George Foreman. George, a word in edgewise?
",302,21,2,8,Bender,Foreman4724,Foreman," This could be the most one-sided fight since 1973 when Ali faced an 80-foot tall mechanical Joe Frazier. M-My memory's not what it used to be but I think the entire Earth was destroyed.
",187,21,2,8,Cosell,Little4725,Little," Interesting, if true. The Vegas odds tonight stand at an unprecedented 1000-0; a bet of $0 on Bender pays $1000 if he wins. Still, very few takers.
",149,21,2,8,Foreman,Foreman4726,Foreman," It's not-not a smart bet.
",27,21,2,8,Little,Leela4727,Leela," According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!
",150,21,2,8,Foreman,Bender4728,Bender," Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!
",40,21,2,8,Leela,Hermes4729,Hermes," Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!
",39,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4730,Bender," Sorry, buddy. Here you go!
",28,21,2,8,Hermes,Hermes4731,Hermes,"  Thank you. It was cold down there on the floor.
",50,21,2,8,Bender,Amy4732,Amy," Here, Professor, I got you a programme.
",41,21,2,8,Hermes,Farnsworth4733,Farnsworth," Oh, good. Just let me put on my reading glasses.  Why, Zoidberg, there's a lovely photo of you in here.
",105,21,2,8,Amy,Referee4734,Referee," In this corner, the confused young robot with the golden curls. Weighing 525lbs: The Gender Bender!
",101,21,2,8,Farnsworth,Zapp4735,Zapp," Boo!
",6,21,2,8,Referee,Nixon4736,Nixon,"  Get that hippie out of the ring!
",35,21,2,8,Zapp,Referee4737,Referee," And in these two corners, weighing 400 tons, the gizmo from Pismo ... Beach, Destructor!
",90,21,2,8,Nixon,Fnog4738,Fnog," So, we meet again. Most amusing: Girl who acts like fighter training fighter who acts like girl.
",98,21,2,8,Referee,Leela4739,Leela," Keep laughing, Fnog!  Ready, Bender?
",38,21,2,8,Fnog,Bender4740,Bender," I was born ready! Gimme the bell!  Did you hear a noise?  Final boarding call for flight 406, non-stop service to pain.  Now boarding standby passengers--
",156,21,2,8,Leela,Foreman4741,Foreman," This seems like as good a time as any time to bring up my new grill for no reason.  With its patented design, the fat drains directly into my mouth.
",150,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4742,Bender,"  Fry! Throw in the towel!  For God's sakes, Fry!
",50,21,2,8,Foreman,Hermes4743,Hermes,"  That's exactly what I was thinking.
",38,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4744,Bender,"  Mommy!
",9,21,2,8,Hermes,Leela4745,Leela," OK, Fnog, that's enough. Call him off. Fnog?  Hmm.
",52,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4746,Bender," Why won't anyone help me?
",27,21,2,8,Leela,Leela4747,Leela," So, once more we meet again.
",30,21,2,8,Bender,Fnog4748,Fnog," Huh?
",6,21,2,8,Leela,Leela4749,Leela," You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet. I mean, cheating in a fake fight. That's low!
",119,21,2,8,Fnog,Fnog4750,Fnog," Better than being a girl. Like you. You're a girl!
",52,21,2,8,Leela,Leela4751,Leela,"  Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!
",49,21,2,8,Fnog,Bender4752,Bender," Huh? It's bendering time!  Take this. And this!
",49,21,2,8,Leela,Fnog4753,Fnog," You were an excellent student.  Too bad I was a lousy teacher!
",64,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4754,Bender," I think you misunderstood the concept of ""bendering time""!
",60,21,2,8,Fnog,Fnog4755,Fnog," See you in girl hell. I'll be in boy hell -- much nicer!
",58,21,2,8,Bender,Leela4756,Leela," Yes!
",6,21,2,8,Fnog,Bender4757,Bender," Yes!  Oh!
",11,21,2,8,Leela,Referee4758,Referee," And the winner is Destructor!
",31,21,2,8,Bender,Little4759,Little," I've not seen a spectacle of this nature in all my years impersonating a sportscaster.
",88,21,2,8,Referee,Foreman4760,Foreman," It sure was some fight. Interesting side note: As a head without a body, I envy the dead.
",91,21,2,8,Little,Little4761,Little," No argument here.
",19,21,2,8,Foreman,Fry4762,Fry," Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!
",63,21,2,8,Little,Amy4763,Amy," Fry, where's your Brain Slug?
",31,21,2,8,Fry,Farnsworth4764,Farnsworth," Poor little guy starved to death.
",35,21,2,8,Amy,Leela4765,Leela," I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school.
",139,21,2,8,Farnsworth,Bender4766,Bender," I'm in tremendous pain here.
",30,21,2,8,Leela,Doubledeal4767,Doubledeal," Great job, kid. You lost and you made it look almost half real. I want you to have this card good for 10% off at Bed Bath & Beyond.
",133,21,2,8,Bender,Bender4768,Bender," Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!
",38,21,2,8,Doubledeal,Little4769,Little," And so ends the chronicle of one of the greatest ever to play the sport.
",74,21,2,8,Bender,Foreman4770,Foreman," And he didn't look half bad in the tutu.
",42,21,2,8,Little,Little4771,Little," That he did surely not.
",25,21,2,8,Foreman,Foreman4772,Foreman," What?
",7,21,2,8,Little,Farnsworth4773,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Several years ago I tried to log on to AOL, and it just went through. Whee! We're online!
",112,22,2,9,Foreman,Farnsworth4774,Farnsworth," Go ahead, get into these net suits. I designed and tested them myself.
",72,22,2,9,Farnsworth,Leela4775,Leela," They smell like burning Rhesus Monkey.
",40,22,2,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth4776,Farnsworth," Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go.
",78,22,2,9,Leela,Fry4777,Fry," Hey!
",6,22,2,9,Farnsworth,Bender4778,Bender," Behold: The Internet!
",23,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4779,Fry," My God! It's full of ads!
",27,22,2,9,Bender,Leela4780,Leela," Follow me!
",12,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4781,Fry," It's immense.
",15,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4782,Leela," It's got every piece of information anyone could ever want.
",61,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4783,Fry," So I see!
",11,22,2,9,Leela,Zoidberg4784,Zoidberg," What? What's going on here?
",29,22,2,9,Fry,Amy4785,Amy," Hey, that's me!
",17,22,2,9,Zoidberg,Bender4786,Bender," No, it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body.
",93,22,2,9,Amy,Leela4787,Leela," Hey!
",6,22,2,9,Bender,Doorman4788,Doorman," Are you over 18?
",18,22,2,9,Leela,Young Boy4789,Young Boy," Yes.
",6,22,2,9,Doorman,Younger Boy4790,Younger Boy," Yes.
",6,22,2,9,Young Boy,Bender4791,Bender," I'm telling you, Fry, they've got a chatroom for everybody. And here it is.
",77,22,2,9,Younger Boy,Amy4792,Amy," Ew, that is so gross!
",23,22,2,9,Bender,Leela4793,Leela," Yeah. I'll stick with this one, thank you.
",44,22,2,9,Amy,Amy4794,Amy," Yeah.
",7,22,2,9,Leela,Bender4795,Bender,"  Hi, I'm a naughty nurse and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.
",80,22,2,9,Amy,Man #14796,Man #1," Ooh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.
",43,22,2,9,Bender,Bender4797,Bender," So how 'bout them Knicks?
",27,22,2,9,Man #1,Nerd #1 #14798,Nerd #1 #1," Hello? Are there any girls in this room at all?
",49,22,2,9,Bender,Nerd #1 #24799,Nerd #1 #2," Yeah, bring on the hot chicks 'cause I'm a hot stud.
",54,22,2,9,Nerd #1 #1,Nerd #1 #34800,Nerd #1 #3," Yeah! So are we!
",18,22,2,9,Nerd #1 #2,Leela4801,Leela," I'm a woman, if that's what you mean.  I don't like to play games, so I'll just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested in meeting a man.
",193,22,2,9,Nerd #1 #3,Nerd #1 #44802,Nerd #1 #4," A woman! I'm scared.
",22,22,2,9,Leela,Fry4803,Fry," Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?
",117,22,2,9,Nerd #1 #4,Bender4804,Bender,"  Is the Space Pope reptilian?
",31,22,2,9,Fry,Hermes4805,Hermes," Get ready for fun, Fry. Nowadays, we have a type of game played entirely on video.
",84,22,2,9,Bender,Leela4806,Leela," We call it a ""video game"".
",28,22,2,9,Hermes,Fry4807,Fry,"  Uh, ""video game"" you say? Well, golly gee, you mighty spacemen of the future will have to show me how it works.
",114,22,2,9,Leela,Zoidberg4808,Zoidberg," The doctor is in!  The doctor is out!
",39,22,2,9,Fry,Holo-Farnsworth4809,Holo-Farnsworth," Everyone, please sign off. We have a delivery. Plus I have to use the phone--  Leela, please tell the others that--
",117,22,2,9,Zoidberg,Leela4810,Leela," Who are you?
",14,22,2,9,Holo-Farnsworth,Cyclops4811,Cyclops," I saw you in the chat room but you left before I had a chance to talk to you. After all these years of searching for another Cyclops.
",135,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4812,Leela," I can't believe it. I've dreamed of this moment all my life.
",62,22,2,9,Cyclops,Cyclops4813,Cyclops," Do you think perhaps you and I--
",34,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4814,Leela," Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am!
",221,22,2,9,Cyclops,Fry4815,Fry," Oh, Leela, I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do--  Gotcha!  I won! I'm the greatest!
",100,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4816,Leela," Come on. We have work to do.
",30,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4817,Fry," Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once-in-a-lifetime chance to learn the meaning of your existence?
",109,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4818,Leela," No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now let's concentrate on getting this desperately-needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14, OK?
",154,22,2,9,Fry,Operator4819,Operator,"  Leela, you've got mail!  It's not spam.
",42,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4820,Leela," Huh?  It's him!
",17,22,2,9,Operator,Cyclops4821,Cyclops,"  To Leela. Subject: Hello. I am Alcazar. Fortunately I wrote down your screenname before I was dispatched by that oafish moron.
",129,22,2,9,Leela,Fry4822,Fry," Kicked your ass!
",18,22,2,9,Cyclops,Alcazar4823,Alcazar,"  Leela, we have much to discuss. Please come join me on the planet of your birth. Co-ordinates follow.
",104,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4824,Fry," Well, too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery.
",59,22,2,9,Alcazar,Leela4825,Leela," It'll get there.
",18,22,2,9,Fry,Leela4826,Leela," After a whole life of searching, I may finally have found where I belong.
",75,22,2,9,Leela,Bender4827,Bender," Too bad it's a dump.
",22,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4828,Leela," Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.
",45,22,2,9,Bender,Fry4829,Fry," Lazy sculptor!
",16,22,2,9,Leela,Alcazar4830,Alcazar," Welcome home, Leela.
",22,22,2,9,Fry,Leela4831,Leela," Alcazar?  Are you real? Or am I seeing single?
",48,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4832,Alcazar," Ow! Of course I'm real.
",25,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4833,Leela," After all this time, somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter or, uh, a kid with a BB gun.
",107,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4834,Alcazar," It's alright, Leela. You'll never be alone again.  Come, let me introduce you to yourself. Do you mind if your servants walk?
",127,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4835,Leela," Not at all!
",13,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4836,Alcazar," We are the last remaining Cyclopses. Our planet is Cyclopia. This is the capital, Cyclops City. Stop me if I'm going too fast for you.
",136,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4837,Leela," There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already.
",81,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4838,Alcazar," This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess of beauty.
",51,22,2,9,Leela,Fry4839,Fry," Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?
",55,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4840,Alcazar," Her perfect eye reminds me of yours, Leela. Had our race survived, you would have been a temple priestess or a supermodel.
",124,22,2,9,Fry,Leela4841,Leela," Oh, please! Really?
",21,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4842,Alcazar," And there's the infamous pirate, Purple Beard, scourge of the six seas.
",73,22,2,9,Leela,Fry4843,Fry," What's over that hill?
",24,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4844,Alcazar," The Forbidden Valley. A holy sanctuary where no one may tread.
",64,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4845,Fry," Is that anything like a cemetery 'cause I gotta take a leak.  Ow!
",67,22,2,9,Alcazar,Leela4846,Leela," Fry, that's offensive to our people.  Isn't it?
",49,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4847,Fry," Ow!
",5,22,2,9,Leela,Alcazar4848,Alcazar," This is my home. I hope you don't think less of me because I live in a giant castle.
",86,22,2,9,Fry,Leela4849,Leela," Oh, no, not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed.
",54,22,2,9,Alcazar,Bender4850,Bender," Ooh! I'm gonna need to make some room.
",40,22,2,9,Leela,Alcazar4851,Alcazar," In here is where I dream my lonely dreams and cook my simple meals.
",69,22,2,9,Bender,Leela4852,Leela," It's all so sad. What happened to our people?
",47,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4853,Alcazar," It's too painful to speak of now. Come, I'll show you your quarters.
",70,22,2,9,Leela,Bender4854,Bender," Ow! Ow! Ow!
",13,22,2,9,Alcazar,Leela4855,Leela," I heard you from my room. What's wrong?
",41,22,2,9,Bender,Alcazar4856,Alcazar," Nothing. It's just-- No, Leela. I don't want to see tears in your perfect eye.
",80,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4857,Leela," Please, is it about the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested in that.
",82,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4858,Alcazar," Well, OK. But it's chilly and you're going to be all wet from the tears. Let's go into my chamber.
",100,22,2,9,Leela,Alcazar4859,Alcazar,"  It wasn't long ago. Our people were happy and prosperous ...  ... but the eyeless mole people of Subterra 3 grew jealous of our visual prowess. They fired missile in all directions hoping to hit Cyclopia.  Unfortunately, one of the 40 planets hit, was ours.
",260,22,2,9,Alcazar,Cyclopian Man #14860,Cyclopian Man #1," How far away do you think it is?
",34,22,2,9,Alcazar,Cyclopian Man #1 #24861,Cyclopian Man #1 #2," A trillion miles?
",19,22,2,9,Cyclopian Man #1,Alcazar4862,Alcazar," Things got hot. You look a little hot, actually. You can take off that jacket.  Our people don't like to be hot. Anyway, just before the impact...
",148,22,2,9,Cyclopian Man #1 #2,Alcazar4863,Alcazar,"  Our smartest scientists managed to save one baby.
",52,22,2,9,Alcazar,Leela4864,Leela," Alcazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!
",54,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4865,Alcazar,"  Fortunately, I was employed as a pool cleaner at the time and, when I emerged from retrieving a dead possum, I found I was the only one left.
",144,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4866,Leela," It's so tragic.
",17,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4867,Alcazar," Yes, but the real tragedy is that our race ends with us.
",58,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4868,Leela," It doesn't have to.
",21,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4869,Alcazar," What do you mean?
",19,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4870,Leela," You're a male and I'm a female.
",33,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4871,Alcazar," I'm still not following you.
",30,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4872,Leela," Wake up, my king.
",19,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4873,Alcazar," Oh, jeez, what a night. Make me some coffee, would you.
",57,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4874,Leela," Uh, sure, OK. What do you take with that?
",43,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4875,Alcazar," Pancakes and sausage. Kitchen's in the basement, pans are in the attic.
",73,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4876,Leela," Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.
",70,22,2,9,Alcazar,Fry4877,Fry," Mmm! Great pancakes, Leela.
",29,22,2,9,Leela,Alcazar4878,Alcazar," Yeah, they'll come in handy if I need to cover any tiny manholes.  Listen, hon', we don't want to look like slobs in front of the other species, do we?
",153,22,2,9,Fry,Leela4879,Leela," No.
",5,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4880,Alcazar," So get to work on these dishes. And then organise my collection of naked celebrity photos by name and what you can see.
",121,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4881,Leela," Look, Alcazar--
",17,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4882,Alcazar," Call me Al.
",13,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4883,Leela," Look, Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise, but I'm not your maid.
",100,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4884,Alcazar," You're right, I'm sorry. I guess the relationship isn't going to work. So much for the Cyclops race. I thought it was a pretty good race but, uh--
",148,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4885,Leela," OK, OK, I'll do the dishes.  Hey, where'd they go?
",52,22,2,9,Alcazar,Bender4886,Bender," Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel: Worshipping some low-life jerk.
",93,22,2,9,Leela,Fry4887,Fry," He may be some low-life jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is.
",118,22,2,9,Bender,Fry4888,Fry," Try and stop me!
",18,22,2,9,Fry,Leela4889,Leela," Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it.  Who are these people?
",65,22,2,9,Fry,Alcazar4890,Alcazar," Friends.
",10,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4891,Leela," Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?
",69,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4892,Alcazar," They were giving it away on the street corner. Just like you, Leela!
",70,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4893,Leela," Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need: Mouthwash, a back wax and stain-proof underwear.
",119,22,2,9,Alcazar,Rat Woman #14894,Rat Woman #1," You go, girl!
",15,22,2,9,Leela,Alcazar4895,Alcazar," By the way, your pal Fry fell into the dungeon. Take him a taco so he doesn't die and stink up the place.
",107,22,2,9,Rat Woman #1,Leela4896,Leela," Come on, Al, can't you let the little guy out?
",48,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4897,Alcazar," Jeez, Leela, twice in one day? I'm not Superman!
",50,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4898,Leela," Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?
",58,22,2,9,Alcazar,Fry4899,Fry," 'Cause I think Alcazar's hiding something from you. Listen, Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alcazar's a jerk. He's bad for you. He--
",184,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4900,Leela," I know.
",9,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4901,Fry," You do?
",9,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4902,Leela," Fry, if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious to me. He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave.
",146,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4903,Fry," Then dump his one-eyed ass.
",29,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4904,Leela," I can't. If I leave Alcazar, that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't let that happen. Even if it means a lifetime of unhappiness.
",139,22,2,9,Fry,Alcazar4905,Alcazar,"  Leela! Mop up in aisle number two!
",37,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4906,Leela," I'll break up with him at dinner.
",35,22,2,9,Alcazar,Fry4907,Fry," I'll be there.
",16,22,2,9,Leela,Alcazar4908,Alcazar," Yo, Leela, what gives? Pig says your slop tastes like crap.
",61,22,2,9,Fry,Pig4909,Pig," Yeah. Like crap.
",18,22,2,9,Alcazar,Fry4910,Fry," C'mon, Leela, you deserve better than this guy. Dump him already!
",67,22,2,9,Pig,Leela4911,Leela," I'm trying.
",13,22,2,9,Fry,Alcazar4912,Alcazar," Hey, everyone, jam a sock in your spit faucets.  Not long ago I spent my lonely nights renting slasher flicks with Rat Man and his girlfriend. But then a beautiful woman arrived and-- Stop eating, Pig! And she brought new hope for me and our once great civilisation. Now a million centuries of Cyclops destiny depend on the answer to one question.  Leela, will you marry me?
",376,22,2,9,Leela,Fry4913,Fry,"  No! No!
",10,22,2,9,Alcazar,Leela4914,Leela," Yes! I will!
",14,22,2,9,Fry,Rat Woman #14915,Rat Woman #1," They're getting married!
",26,22,2,9,Leela,Amy4916,Amy," Congratulations, Leela!
",25,22,2,9,Rat Woman #1,Zoidberg4917,Zoidberg," Hello.
",8,22,2,9,Amy,Hermes4918,Hermes," Oh, this is great!
",20,22,2,9,Zoidberg,Leela4919,Leela,"  Glad you could make it.
",26,22,2,9,Hermes,Bender4920,Bender,"  It's a magical day.
",22,22,2,9,Leela,Fry4921,Fry,"  Welcome!
",11,22,2,9,Bender,Fry4922,Fry," Psst, Leela. You've gotta get me out of here. It's horrible! Eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo.
",144,22,2,9,Fry,Leela4923,Leela," Animals go in the corner.
",27,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4924,Fry," The corner! Why didn't I think of that?
",41,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4925,Leela," Look, Fry, I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy.  Here. Try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be.
",143,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4926,Fry," That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.
",45,22,2,9,Leela,Fry4927,Fry," Bender, come on. We've gotta get some dirt on Alcazar. Let's go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.
",124,22,2,9,Fry,Bender4928,Bender," Uh, no, thanks. I'm good.
",27,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4929,Fry," But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.
",63,22,2,9,Bender,Bender4930,Bender," I don't know, Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough.
",82,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4931,Fry," Bender, snap out of it!
",25,22,2,9,Bender,Bender4932,Bender," Sorry, I don't know what came over me. Let's go.   I love stealing, I love taking things!
",91,22,2,9,Fry,Zoidberg4933,Zoidberg,"  That pig over there is wearing the same sandals as me.
",57,22,2,9,Bender,Fry4934,Fry," Come on, boy, jump!  Good boy!
",32,22,2,9,Zoidberg,Bender4935,Bender," Whoa, Mittens!
",16,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4936,Fry," My God! Four identical castles!
",33,22,2,9,Bender,Bender4937,Bender," Each more identical than the last!
",36,22,2,9,Fry,Fry4938,Fry," That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes.
",66,22,2,9,Bender,Bender4939,Bender," And here's another one with no eyes.
",38,22,2,9,Fry,Preacherbot4940,Preacherbot," Does anyone have a reason why this couple shall not be joined in the irrevocable shackles of holy bliss?
",106,22,2,9,Bender,Farnsworth4941,Farnsworth," Saving a race of one-eyed monsters? Who could object to that?
",63,22,2,9,Preacherbot,Alcazar4942,Alcazar," Cut to the chase, Preach!
",27,22,2,9,Farnsworth,Preacherbot4943,Preacherbot," Do you, Alcazar ...  ...  take this woman before you ... to love ... in sickness ... do you part?
",99,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4944,Alcazar," Yeah, sure I do. Come on, faster!
",35,22,2,9,Preacherbot,Preacherbot4945,Preacherbot," Do you, Leela, copy and paste his response till death do you part?
",68,22,2,9,Alcazar,Leela4946,Leela," I ... d--
",11,22,2,9,Preacherbot,Amy4947,Amy," Oh, my God!
",13,22,2,9,Leela,Alcazar4948,Alcazar," What the--?
",13,22,2,9,Amy,Fry4949,Fry," Hey, Alcazar, you left somebody off the guest list.
",53,22,2,9,Alcazar,Five-Eyed Woman #14950,Five-Eyed Woman #1," Alcazar, why you are so late for our wedding? And why you have only one eye?
",78,22,2,9,Fry,Alcazar4951,Alcazar," It ... ooh, uh!  Hey, sweetie. Just go back to the castle and wait for me.  She-- She's nuts. I can morph into a five-eyed alien and I kinda said I'd marry her. But I'm really a Cyclops and I'm really going to marry you.
",222,22,2,9,Five-Eyed Woman #1,Fry4952,Fry," Oh, yeah? Then what about this?
",33,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4953,Alcazar," This is a bit awkward.
",24,22,2,9,Fry,Five-Eyed Woman #14954,Five-Eyed Woman #1," Who's she?
",12,22,2,9,Alcazar,Leela4955,Leela," Who's she?
",12,22,2,9,Five-Eyed Woman #1,Sandy4956,Sandy," Who are they?
",15,22,2,9,Leela,Alcazar4957,Alcazar," Go back to the castle, Sandy.
",31,22,2,9,Sandy,Fry4958,Fry," And maybe you'd like to meet her.  And her.
",45,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4959,Alcazar," Leela, this must all be very confusing.
",41,22,2,9,Fry,Leela4960,Leela," A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it.
",69,22,2,9,Alcazar,Sandy4961,Sandy," Show us your real form!
",25,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4962,Leela," Yeah!
",7,22,2,9,Sandy,Alien #24963,Alien #2," Do it!
",8,22,2,9,Leela,Alcazar4964,Alcazar," Well, this is the real me. But I can explain: We all have needs. Mine was to make it with five weirdos and have them scrub my five castles. I gave you all what you wanted and of course I made a few bucks letting Pig watch through the two-way mirror. Can any of you say you wouldn't have done the exact same thing in my position?
",330,22,2,9,Alien #2,Bender4965,Bender,"  He's a saint!
",16,22,2,9,Alcazar,Leela4966,Leela," But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?
",57,22,2,9,Bender,Alcazar4967,Alcazar," Hey, lady, you got any idea what it costs to rent a tux that changes shape?
",77,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4968,Leela," Alright, Alcazar, I just have one last question for you.
",58,22,2,9,Alcazar,Alcazar4969,Alcazar," What's that?
",14,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4970,Leela," If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?
",80,22,2,9,Alcazar,Leela4971,Leela," Thanks for saving me from that creep, Fry.
",44,22,2,9,Leela,Fry4972,Fry," Hey, that's what I do.
",24,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4973,Leela," I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who I really was.
",85,22,2,9,Fry,Farnsworth4974,Farnsworth," No harm done. In the many decades you'll work to repay me for that shipment of popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty of time to search for your true home.
",160,22,2,9,Leela,Leela4975,Leela," Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?
",46,22,2,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth4976,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! The university is bringing me up on disciplinary charges. Wait, that's not good news at all.
",115,23,2,10,Leela,Leela4977,Leela," Whatever you did, Professor, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation.
",73,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth4978,Farnsworth," Yes, but they won't listen. Everyone's always in favour of saving Hitler's brain but when you put it in the body of a great white shark, ooh, suddenly you've gone too far.
",173,23,2,10,Leela,Vernon4979,Vernon," Professor Farnsworth, do you know why we've called you here today?
",68,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth4980,Farnsworth," Listen to me, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me. Dean Vernon, I know the truth: It was you driving your hover-car that night, not your horse. Dean Epsilon, I know all about your ""Department of Pool Boy Studies"". And Dr. Wernstrom ... Wernstrom!
",278,23,2,10,Vernon,Vernon4981,Vernon," Actually, Professor, we merely called you here to say...  Surprise!
",69,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Man #14982,Man #1," Surprise!
",11,23,2,10,Vernon,Man #1 #24983,Man #1 #2," Happy birthday!
",17,23,2,10,Man #1,Hermes4984,Hermes," Surprise!
",11,23,2,10,Man #1 #2,Farnsworth4985,Farnsworth," And you, Coach Smalley, or should I say ""Coach hairpiece""?
",60,23,2,10,Hermes,Leela4986,Leela," No, Professor! It's a surprise party for your 150th birthday.
",63,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth4987,Farnsworth,"  Hundred and ... what?  Ooh!
",30,23,2,10,Leela,Bender4988,Bender," Good evening, I'm--  Whoa, sorry. I'm Bender and I'll be emceeing this roast. Y'know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps. So here's the Professor's oldest friend, a grotesque, stinking lobster.
",213,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Zoidberg4989,Zoidberg," Good evening, ladies and germs.  That wasn't a joke, I was talking to Dean Streptococcus.  Now, I'm not saying Professor Farnsworth is old, but if you consider his age, he's likely to die soon.  Hey, Ringo, that was the joke. Oh, it's Showtime at the Apollo all over again.
",275,23,2,10,Bender,Bender4990,Bender," Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there!  But seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's delivery ship, our next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Musky?
",225,23,2,10,Zoidberg,Zoidberg4991,Zoidberg," I wouldn't wanna follow that guy!
",35,23,2,10,Bender,Bender4992,Bender," And now, a man who needs no introduction.   Fry, get up there!
",64,23,2,10,Zoidberg,Fry4993,Fry," Oh.  Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Professor Farnsworth, I thought ""Why should I?"" Then later Leela made the film. But if I had made the film, you could bet there would have been a lot more topless women on motorcycles!  Roll film!
",277,23,2,10,Bender,Leela4994,Leela,"  Hubert J. Farnsworth was born April 9th 2851 in New New York's nerdiest slum, Hell's Laboratory. A precocious child, young Hubert learned to read while he was still in diapers -- at age 8.  And before long he blossomed into a greasy teenager.
",245,23,2,10,Fry,Fry4995,Fry,"  Dork alert!
",14,23,2,10,Leela,Leela4996,Leela,"  After 14 years of graduate school, Farnsworth settled into the glamorous life of a scientist: Fast cars, trendy nightspots, beautiful women -- the Professor designed them all working out of his tiny, one-room apartment.  For 50 years he worked at Mom's Friendly Robot Company, where he created the first robot capable of qualifying for a boat loan.  And even as he nears his 150th birthday, the Professor retains the fiery passion of youth.
",443,23,2,10,Fry,Farnsworth4997,Farnsworth,"  Listen, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me.
",77,23,2,10,Leela,Bender4998,Bender," How 'bout a few words, Professor?
",35,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth4999,Farnsworth," Eh, wha?
",10,23,2,10,Bender,Bender5000,Bender," I said ""words"".
",17,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5001,Farnsworth," Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishment summed up in a 3-minute film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. So little time.
",160,23,2,10,Bender,Bender5002,Bender," Funny, funny stuff.
",21,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5003,Farnsworth," My life is over.
",18,23,2,10,Bender,Leela5004,Leela," No, it isn't. You have another 10 years left.
",47,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Fry5005,Fry," Leela! He could live another 100 years!
",41,23,2,10,Leela,Leela5006,Leela," No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious planet and you never return.
",120,23,2,10,Fry,Fry5007,Fry," Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?
",49,23,2,10,Leela,Bender5008,Bender,"  Nobody knows!
",16,23,2,10,Fry,Farnsworth5009,Farnsworth," So many loves half-loved, so many inventions half-invented. That damn time machine alone set me back 15 years.
",112,23,2,10,Bender,Zoidberg5010,Zoidberg," If only it'd worked, you could go back and not waste your time on it.
",71,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5011,Farnsworth," There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take care of my work and my research and my fabulous fortune.  By God, that's it! I've got to name a successor.
",166,23,2,10,Zoidberg,Fry5012,Fry," A successor?
",14,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Zoidberg5013,Zoidberg," A successor to the Professor?
",31,23,2,10,Fry,Farnsworth5014,Farnsworth," There's no time to lose. I'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming machine!
",81,23,2,10,Zoidberg,Fry5015,Fry," Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days.
",48,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Bender5016,Bender," I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor. Then I hope he did die.
",94,23,2,10,Fry,Zoidberg5017,Zoidberg," You? The successor? Over my empty shell! The Professor will pick me. Only I have his lobster-like tenacity.
",109,23,2,10,Bender,Hermes5018,Hermes," Up yours, Zoidberg. Up wherever your species traditionally crams things. The only sensible way to choose a successor is with a limbo contest.
",143,23,2,10,Zoidberg,Leela5019,Leela," What?
",7,23,2,10,Hermes,Hermes5020,Hermes," Kingston rules. Two men go down, one come up.
",47,23,2,10,Leela,Leela5021,Leela," Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the rest of you with his dentures.
",108,23,2,10,Hermes,Amy5022,Amy," Yesh, he would.
",17,23,2,10,Leela,Fry5023,Fry," Sorry, everyone, but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water.
",70,23,2,10,Amy,Zoidberg5024,Zoidberg,"  Blood ... thicker ... water.
",31,23,2,10,Fry,Farnsworth5025,Farnsworth," Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. So anyone with a weak heart should leave now. Goodbye.
",103,23,2,10,Zoidberg,Leela5026,Leela," Uh, Professor?
",16,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5027,Farnsworth," Oh, oh, yes, the announcement! As you all know, I am not long for this world.
",79,23,2,10,Leela,Leela5028,Leela," Yes, we know.
",15,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Hermes5029,Hermes," True, mon.
",12,23,2,10,Leela,Amy5030,Amy," Buh!
",6,23,2,10,Hermes,Fry5031,Fry," One foot in the grave.
",24,23,2,10,Amy,Farnsworth5032,Farnsworth," So I've picked my successor. It's someone in whom I have great faith -- even though his mind is undeveloped and he's accomplished nothing.  My closest living relative.
",169,23,2,10,Fry,Fry5033,Fry," Oh, yeah!
",11,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5034,Farnsworth," My clone, Cubert Farnsworth.
",30,23,2,10,Fry,Zoidberg5035,Zoidberg," He's horrible!
",16,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Fry5036,Fry," Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?
",53,23,2,10,Zoidberg,Amy5037,Amy," You wish!
",11,23,2,10,Fry,Fry5038,Fry," Where did Cubert come from?
",29,23,2,10,Amy,Farnsworth5039,Farnsworth," 12 years ago I began the cloning process by removing some skin cells from one of the shapelier growths on my back.
",116,23,2,10,Fry,Leela5040,Leela," Wait. If he's your clone, why doesn't his nose look like yours?
",65,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5041,Farnsworth," I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished up against the side.
",80,23,2,10,Leela,Bender5042,Bender," Is he dumb or just ugly?
",26,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5043,Farnsworth," Let's find out.
",17,23,2,10,Bender,Cubert5044,Cubert," What? You've never seen a genius's wiener before?
",51,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Zoidberg5045,Zoidberg," No.
",5,23,2,10,Cubert,Leela5046,Leela," Never.
",8,23,2,10,Zoidberg,Fry5047,Fry," Well, once in the park.
",25,23,2,10,Leela,Zoidberg5048,Zoidberg," Mmm!
",6,23,2,10,Fry,Cubert5049,Cubert," As long as I'm going to be in charge here, let me examine my so-called ""crew"", if it can so be called. First of all, Dr. Zoidberg, do you even have a medical degree?
",167,23,2,10,Zoidberg,Zoidberg5050,Zoidberg," I lost it ... in a volcano.
",29,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5051,Cubert," And why do we need a bending robot around here anyway? What possible use do we have for you?
",94,23,2,10,Zoidberg,Bender5052,Bender," Uh ... me no speaka the English.
",34,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5053,Cubert," And why does our space pilot have only one eye? There's someone I'd like you to meet. His name is depth perception!
",117,23,2,10,Bender,Leela5054,Leela," Why, you little--
",19,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5055,Cubert," Wow, that hurt -- the air!
",28,23,2,10,Leela,Bender5056,Bender," Im pending para un bending!
",29,23,2,10,Cubert,Farnsworth5057,Farnsworth," Oh, Cubert, come in here. I have something amazing to show you.
",65,23,2,10,Bender,Cubert5058,Cubert," What is it? A competent employee? I doubt that very much!
",59,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Fry5059,Fry," Little twerp.
",15,23,2,10,Cubert,Bender5060,Bender," Aye, Chihuahua!
",17,23,2,10,Fry,Farnsworth5061,Farnsworth," As my successor, I'm trusting you to carry on my work. These are just some of the half-finished inventions you'll spend your life finishing.
",142,23,2,10,Bender,Cubert5062,Cubert," I didn't realise you were the inventor of the junk heap.
",58,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5063,Farnsworth," That's my prize-winning Smellescope. If a dog craps anywhere in the universe, you can bet I won't be out of the loop.  And this is my universal translator. Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language.
",237,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5064,Cubert," Hello.
",8,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Universal Translator5065,Universal Translator," Bonjour!
",10,23,2,10,Cubert,Farnsworth5066,Farnsworth," Crazy gibberish!
",18,23,2,10,Universal Translator,Cubert5067,Cubert," Don't you have any worthwhile inventions?
",43,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5068,Farnsworth," Why, certainly. Step over here.
",33,23,2,10,Cubert,Farnsworth5069,Farnsworth," These are the dark matter engines I invented. They allow my starship to travel between galaxies in mere hours.
",112,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Cubert5070,Cubert," That's impossible. You can't go faster than the speed of light.
",65,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5071,Farnsworth," Of course not. That's why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.
",76,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5072,Cubert," Also impossible.
",18,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5073,Farnsworth," And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner which delivers 200% fuel efficiency.
",100,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5074,Cubert," That's especially impossible.
",31,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5075,Farnsworth," Not at all. It's very simple.
",31,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5076,Cubert," Then explain it.
",18,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5077,Farnsworth," Now that's impossible. It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another dream.
",83,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5078,Cubert," Your explanations are pure weapons-grade bolog-nium. It's all impossible.
",75,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5079,Farnsworth," Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being is a scientist is all about.
",98,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5080,Cubert," No, that's what being a magical elf is all about.
",51,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Bender5081,Bender," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh, kill me now, people!
",75,23,2,10,Cubert,Elzar5082,Elzar," How we doing here?
",20,23,2,10,Bender,Bender5083,Bender," Oh, Elzar, everything's so good!
",34,23,2,10,Elzar,Elzar5084,Elzar," What are you, an ass-kissing machine?
",39,23,2,10,Bender,Bender5085,Bender," Yes, sir! Good one, sir!
",26,23,2,10,Elzar,Farnsworth5086,Farnsworth," Oh, it's a gem of an evening. I feel so wonderful having someone to take over my life's work. And it's all thanks to Cubert.
",126,23,2,10,Bender,Cubert5087,Cubert," Look, Professor, I may be identical to you in every possible way but that doesn't mean I'm anything like you.
",111,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5088,Farnsworth," You ... wha?
",14,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5089,Cubert," I don't wanna be an inventor. I wanna be something useful like a teacher's aide or a prison guard or a science-fiction cartoon writer.
",136,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5090,Farnsworth," But-But what about my hopes and my dreams and my wonderful inventions?
",72,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5091,Cubert," In your entire life your only half-decent invention was me and I didn't turn out like you wanted either.
",106,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Elzar5092,Elzar," You folks still doing alright?
",32,23,2,10,Cubert,Bender5093,Bender," Oh, yes, Elzar.
",17,23,2,10,Elzar,Elzar5094,Elzar," Good, 'cause it turns out I forgot to cook that chicken.
",58,23,2,10,Bender,Farnsworth5095,Farnsworth," Bad news, everyone. By the time you watch this tape, I'll be gone, leaving behind me nothing but a history of failure and my original hip-bones. You see, I've been lying about my age; I'm not actually 150, I'm 160. Oh, vanity, thy name is Professor Farnsworth. And now that I have nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away.
",357,23,2,10,Elzar,Farnsworth5096,Farnsworth," Goodbye, cruel world.  Goodbye, cruel lamp.  Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin ...  ... and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords, cruel though they may be a--
",223,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5097,Farnsworth,"  And now that I've nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away.
",95,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Amy5098,Amy," What?
",7,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Hermes5099,Hermes," Oh, no!
",9,23,2,10,Amy,Zoidberg5100,Zoidberg," Oh.
",5,23,2,10,Hermes,Farnsworth5101,Farnsworth,"  I know you're all very upset, especially Bender.
",51,23,2,10,Zoidberg,Bender5102,Bender," Well, life goes on. Except for you!
",37,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5103,Farnsworth,"  I'm sure that Bender has just made a cutting remark, but he doesn't know I taped over his soap operas to record this message.
",128,23,2,10,Bender,Bender5104,Bender," You bastard!
",14,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Fry5105,Fry," We've gotta get him back.
",27,23,2,10,Bender,Cubert5106,Cubert," Impossible! No one knows where they take those old geezers.
",61,23,2,10,Fry,Fry5107,Fry," Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like I do.
",91,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5108,Cubert," You're his uncle, dummy. He takes after you.
",46,23,2,10,Fry,Fry5109,Fry," Uh ... what?
",14,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5110,Cubert," Wait a second. That means I also take after you!
",50,23,2,10,Fry,Leela5111,Leela," Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor.
",50,23,2,10,Cubert,Bender5112,Bender," Lay it on us, big boots.
",26,23,2,10,Leela,Leela5113,Leela," If the Smellescope can pick up the Professor's odour, we may have a chance to save him.
",89,23,2,10,Bender,Cubert5114,Cubert," I think not. As you probably already don't know, odours are made up of particles that can't travel through the vacuum of space.
",129,23,2,10,Leela,Leela5115,Leela," I'm zeroing in on him.  BENGAY ... mothballs ...  ... letters to the editor. It's the Professor!
",98,23,2,10,Cubert,Bender5116,Bender," To the flying machine!
",24,23,2,10,Leela,Fry5117,Fry," To the left!  No, to the up!  U-turn! U-turn!
",47,23,2,10,Bender,Cubert5118,Cubert," We'll never find this place. Robots are very good at keeping secrets.
",71,23,2,10,Fry,Bender5119,Bender," No, we're not, you little bed-wetter. Oops! I'm sorry.
",56,23,2,10,Cubert,Leela5120,Leela," There it is! The Near-Death Star!
",35,23,2,10,Bender,Leela5121,Leela," OK, we'll tell them the Professor escaped and we're bringing him back. Fry, you'll have to dress up like a 160-year-old man.
",126,23,2,10,Leela,Fry5122,Fry," I'm on it!
",12,23,2,10,Leela,Cubert5123,Cubert,"  My God, the illusion is so perfect I almost forgot I was looking at an idiot!
",80,23,2,10,Fry,Leela5124,Leela," Now, they may ask for a DNA sample.
",37,23,2,10,Cubert,Fry5125,Fry," I'd like to see them find it!
",31,23,2,10,Leela,Cubert5126,Cubert," This plan is impossible. We don't even have a sample of the Professor's DNA.
",78,23,2,10,Fry,Bender5127,Bender," I think I know where to get some.
",35,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5128,Cubert," Why do I have to be the hump?
",31,23,2,10,Bender,Fry5129,Fry," 'Cause you're too ugly to be a wart.
",38,23,2,10,Cubert,Leela5130,Leela," Your Medicare dollars at work.
",32,23,2,10,Fry,Barrierbot #15131,Barrierbot #1," Halt! Identify this guest.
",28,23,2,10,Leela,Leela5132,Leela," Uh, this is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. He escaped.
",54,23,2,10,Barrierbot #1,Barrierbot #15133,Barrierbot #1," Escaped? No one escapes.
",26,23,2,10,Leela,Barrierbot #25134,Barrierbot #2," This guest does not look 160.
",31,23,2,10,Barrierbot #1,Fry5135,Fry," What? I'm old. Listen:  Hey, you kids, get off the lawn!
",58,23,2,10,Barrierbot #2,Barrierbot #15136,Barrierbot #1," Hmm, it is true old people are often concerned that there are children on their lawns.
",88,23,2,10,Fry,Barrierbot #25137,Barrierbot #2," There's no denying that. But we'll still need to verify his identity with a DNA sample.
",89,23,2,10,Barrierbot #1,Bender5138,Bender," Got a hot, steaming batch right here!
",39,23,2,10,Barrierbot #2,Barrierbot #25139,Barrierbot #2," We only needed one cell!
",26,23,2,10,Bender,Bender5140,Bender," Eh, keep the change, buddy.
",29,23,2,10,Barrierbot #2,Cubert5141,Cubert," Stupid robot.
",15,23,2,10,Bender,Barrierbot #15142,Barrierbot #1," Did your hump just say something?
",35,23,2,10,Cubert,Fry5143,Fry," Uh ... I-I've got talking hump syndrome.
",42,23,2,10,Barrierbot #1,Barrierbot #15144,Barrierbot #1," Ah, T.H.S.
",12,23,2,10,Fry,Barrierbot #25145,Barrierbot #2," Identity confirmed. Return this shambling shuffle-boarder to his room.
",72,23,2,10,Barrierbot #1,Barrierbot #15146,Barrierbot #1," 7152 Maple Drive.
",19,23,2,10,Barrierbot #2,Leela5147,Leela," Sounds nice.
",14,23,2,10,Barrierbot #1,Barrierbot #15148,Barrierbot #1," Prepare to be surprised.
",26,23,2,10,Leela,Fry5149,Fry," So this is where they stick old people. It's horrific!
",56,23,2,10,Barrierbot #1,Leela5150,Leela," At least it keeps them from driving.
",38,23,2,10,Fry,Leela5151,Leela," Brace yourself for the worst.
",31,23,2,10,Leela,Bender5152,Bender," And yet he looks so natural.
",30,23,2,10,Leela,Cubert5153,Cubert," What's happening?
",19,23,2,10,Bender,Leela5154,Leela," He's hooked up to a life-support system.  We have to disconnect him very, very carefully, or the shock could kill him.
",120,23,2,10,Cubert,Guard #1bot #15155,Guard #1bot #1," Freeze!  Seize them!
",22,23,2,10,Leela,Guard #1bot #25156,Guard #1bot #2," Seize them!
",13,23,2,10,Guard #1bot #1,Guard #1bot #35157,Guard #1bot #3," Seize them!
",13,23,2,10,Guard #1bot #2,Guard #1bot #45158,Guard #1bot #4," Seize them!
",13,23,2,10,Guard #1bot #3,Guard #1bot #15159,Guard #1bot #1," Get them-- I mean seize them!
",31,23,2,10,Guard #1bot #4,Guard #1bot #25160,Guard #1bot #2," Aww, I'm so bad at this!
",26,23,2,10,Guard #1bot #1,Guard #1bot #35161,Guard #1bot #3," Uh-oh!
",8,23,2,10,Guard #1bot #2,Leela5162,Leela," We're probably gonna make it, but we might not.
",49,23,2,10,Guard #1bot #3,Cubert5163,Cubert," It's impossible! We'll never fit.
",35,23,2,10,Leela,Fry5164,Fry," Will too!
",11,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5165,Cubert," Told you.
",11,23,2,10,Fry,Fry5166,Fry," Come on, Leela! Step your big boot down on the gas pedal.
",59,23,2,10,Cubert,Leela5167,Leela," They've blown out one of our engines!
",39,23,2,10,Fry,Fry5168,Fry,"  Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!
",74,23,2,10,Leela,Leela5169,Leela," Only the Professor knows how to fix it. We have to wake him up.
",65,23,2,10,Fry,Fry5170,Fry," Try shocking him.
",19,23,2,10,Leela,Bender5171,Bender,"  Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than it used to! Young people use curse words!
",103,23,2,10,Fry,Fry5172,Fry," Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine ourself.
",47,23,2,10,Bender,Leela5173,Leela," We can't, you bastard! No one knows how it works. It's impossible!
",68,23,2,10,Fry,Cubert5174,Cubert," Nothing is impossible. I understand how the engines work now. It came to me in a dream.  The engines don't move the ship at all. The ship stays where it is and the engines move the universe around it.
",202,23,2,10,Leela,Bender5175,Bender," That's a complete load.
",25,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5176,Cubert," Nothing's a complete load. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being a scientist is all about. Right, Professor?  Let's ride!
",130,23,2,10,Bender,Cubert5177,Cubert," Good news, everyone! He's made a complete recovery.
",53,23,2,10,Cubert,Amy5178,Amy," Yeah!
",7,23,2,10,Cubert,Hermes5179,Hermes," Wow!
",6,23,2,10,Amy,Leela5180,Leela," All right!
",12,23,2,10,Hermes,Farnsworth5181,Farnsworth," I'm as spry as a 140-year-old.  See? I only broke one ankle.
",62,23,2,10,Leela,Fry5182,Fry," So what were they doing to you in that awful drawer?
",54,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5183,Farnsworth," Oh, they had me hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely real.
",83,23,2,10,Fry,Amy5184,Amy," What was it like?
",19,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5185,Farnsworth," It was as though I were living in a facility in Florida with hundreds of other old people. All day long we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call.
",169,23,2,10,Amy,Leela5186,Leela," It's a hundred times more horrible than anything I could imagine.
",67,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5187,Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes. Thank you all for saving me. Especially you, my little clone. No matter what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you.
",148,23,2,10,Leela,Cubert5188,Cubert," I've already decided. Dad, when I grow up I wanna be just like you.
",69,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5189,Farnsworth," Don't worry, son, you will. Incidentally, you might want to read up on a condition known as ""wandering bladder"".
",114,23,2,10,Cubert,Cubert5190,Cubert," Why?
",6,23,2,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5191,Farnsworth," No reason. No reason at all.
",30,23,2,10,Cubert,Hermes5192,Hermes," Finally, the last form of the day. Welcome to Stampy Town. Population, five!  And now for the finishing touch.  Ah, the cycle of bureaucracy.  Sweet gorilla of Manila! A letter from the Central Bureaucracy!   Attention, Hermes Conrad: You are about to receive a letter from the Central Bureaucracy.  My God! It's from the Central Bureaucracy!
",344,24,2,11,Farnsworth,Leela5193,Leela," I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You guys interested?
",100,24,2,11,Hermes,Bender5194,Bender," I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
",42,24,2,11,Leela,Fry5195,Fry," I'll play.
",12,24,2,11,Bender,Bender5196,Bender," I'm in!
",9,24,2,11,Fry,Zoidberg5197,Zoidberg," Leela, Fry, robot. No matter what it is you're doing tonight, I'm available.
",78,24,2,11,Bender,Leela5198,Leela," We're playing poker. But I'm warning you, my friends are serious players.
",75,24,2,11,Zoidberg,Zoidberg5199,Zoidberg," Bah, big shots. I say let the dice do the talking.
",52,24,2,11,Leela,Fry5200,Fry," Wow! You look happy. Is someone fired?
",40,24,2,11,Zoidberg,Hermes5201,Hermes," Better! The Central Bureaucracy is conducting an inspection tomorrow. I will finally be promoted to grade 35, the 35th highest grade there is.
",144,24,2,11,Fry,Leela5202,Leela," Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch of your famous jerk dip.
",94,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5203,Hermes," Sorry, I spent all day putting my office in order. Now I got to go home and relax the traditional Jamaican way: A glass of warm milk and good night sleep.
",156,24,2,11,Leela,Fry5204,Fry," Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer-space potato man.
",65,24,2,11,Hermes,Leela5205,Leela," Ah, that must be my old boss.
",31,24,2,11,Fry,Ipgee5206,Ipgee," Hello, Leela. You're fired.
",29,24,2,11,Leela,Leela5207,Leela," I know.
",9,24,2,11,Ipgee,Ipgee5208,Ipgee," I'm sorry but it's just that you're over a year late for work at this point.
",78,24,2,11,Leela,Terry5209,Terry,"  Let the games begin!
",23,24,2,11,Ipgee,Ipgee5210,Ipgee," So I told Leela, ""Your request for a date is most flattering but I must decline."" These office romances never work out. After all, that is how I met my horrible wife.
",168,24,2,11,Terry,Leela5211,Leela," But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife.
",61,24,2,11,Ipgee,Ipgee5212,Ipgee," And my wife doesn't know I have a job. I keep my personal and professional lives separate.
",92,24,2,11,Leela,Bender5213,Bender," Come on, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor.
",75,24,2,11,Ipgee,Fry5214,Fry," What's with the specs, Bender?
",32,24,2,11,Bender,Bender5215,Bender," They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing eye dog was taking a whiz.
",108,24,2,11,Fry,Fry5216,Fry," Hey!
",6,24,2,11,Bender,Zoidberg5217,Zoidberg," I can't spell anything with these cards.
",42,24,2,11,Fry,Zoidberg5218,Zoidberg," Finally, I have a good claw. See?  Three human females, a number and a king giving himself brain surgery.
",107,24,2,11,Zoidberg,Fry5219,Fry," It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak.
",78,24,2,11,Zoidberg,Bender5220,Bender," Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades!  Nothing, nothing, crap, crap, garbage.  Read 'em and leak salt water!
",117,24,2,11,Fry,Fry5221,Fry," Oh, man!
",10,24,2,11,Bender,Terry5222,Terry," That's my baby's milk money!
",30,24,2,11,Fry,Ipgee5223,Ipgee," Oh, I am broke. What will I tell my horrible wife?
",52,24,2,11,Terry,Bender5224,Bender," If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town on your intestines.
",89,24,2,11,Ipgee,Ipgee5225,Ipgee,"  Let me see those glasses.
",28,24,2,11,Bender,Bender5226,Bender," Um ... uh...
",14,24,2,11,Ipgee,Ipgee5227,Ipgee," Oh, my various Gods! X-Ray specs!
",35,24,2,11,Bender,Bender5228,Bender," Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need 'em for reading stuff ... on the other side of stuff.
",100,24,2,11,Ipgee,Lou5229,Lou," Cheater!
",10,24,2,11,Bender,Ipgee5230,Ipgee," Get him!
",10,24,2,11,Lou,Terry5231,Terry," Break his neck!
",17,24,2,11,Ipgee,Zoidberg5232,Zoidberg," No, don't hurt him! He's my best friend!
",42,24,2,11,Terry,Bender5233,Bender,"  Hey, you wouldn't hit a guy with X-Ray glasses would you?  Ow! Easy on the arm! Oh! Oh, my ass!
",98,24,2,11,Zoidberg,Hermes5234,Hermes," Great cow of Moscow!
",22,24,2,11,Bender,Bender5235,Bender," Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!
",45,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5236,Hermes," Oh! I'll never pass inspection now. They'll bust me lower than a limbo stick ... at carnival time.   And that's as low as limbo sticks get.
",141,24,2,11,Bender,Fry5237,Fry," Aw, hey, c'mon, don't worry. We'll watch you clean up.
",56,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5238,Hermes," It's too late. The inspector will be here in exactly one second.
",66,24,2,11,Fry,Hermes5239,Hermes," Who the hell are you?
",23,24,2,11,Hermes,Morgan5240,Morgan," Morgan Proctor, bureaucrat grade 19.
",38,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5241,Hermes," Hermes Conrad, bureaucrat grade 36.
",37,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5242,Morgan," Enough friendly banter. Shall we begin the inspection?
",56,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5243,Hermes," This way, please.
",19,24,2,11,Morgan,Fry5244,Fry,"  Jeez, Hermes, you seem awfully calm about this.
",50,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5245,Hermes,"  Don't worry. I have a plan.
",30,24,2,11,Fry,Hermes5246,Hermes,"  I'm going to jump!
",21,24,2,11,Hermes,Amy5247,Amy,"  No!
",6,24,2,11,Hermes,Zoidberg5248,Zoidberg,"  No!
",6,24,2,11,Amy,Bender5249,Bender,"  Do a flip!
",13,24,2,11,Zoidberg,Leela5250,Leela,"  Don't do it, Hermes! You have so much to live for.
",53,24,2,11,Bender,Bender5251,Bender,"  I get it, reverse psychology.
",32,24,2,11,Leela,Farnsworth5252,Farnsworth,"  Please, old friend, don't jump. Use another method that won't damage your liver. Other people need it, you know.
",115,24,2,11,Bender,Labarbara5253,Labarbara,"  Husband! Nooo!
",17,24,2,11,Farnsworth,Hermes5254,Hermes," Outta my way, wife! I wasn't cut out to be a bureaucrat anyway. I'm only anal 78.36% of the time. I'm not worthy to stamp a form, so I'll stamp the pavement with my flabby body.
",179,24,2,11,Labarbara,Morgan5255,Morgan,"  Bureaucrat Conrad, if you complete your death transaction without filing a suicide and/or falling accident permit, you will be posthumously demoted.
",151,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5256,Hermes," Life. Death. Either way I'm demoted to a tiny cubicle.
",56,24,2,11,Morgan,Hermes5257,Hermes," Sweet something of ... of someplace.
",38,24,2,11,Hermes,Morgan5258,Morgan," As your superior, I hereby relieve you of duty. Consider yourself on paid vacation.
",85,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5259,Hermes," Oh! The ultimate penalty!
",27,24,2,11,Morgan,Zoidberg5260,Zoidberg," I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, the sauna planet. Here, read.
",69,24,2,11,Hermes,Labarbara5261,Labarbara," Spa 5? Is it good?
",20,24,2,11,Zoidberg,Zoidberg5262,Zoidberg," Oh, it's wonderful! I don't know anything about it but they give me a bucket of krill for every patient I send.
",113,24,2,11,Labarbara,Morgan5263,Morgan," Naturally I'll have to assign a bureaucrat to fill in for Hermes while he's away. I assign me, I accept. Welcome aboard.
",122,24,2,11,Zoidberg,Zoidberg5264,Zoidberg," Then it's settled. Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat. Hurrah!
",69,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5265,Morgan," I've been reviewing your corporate records. Regarding last Monday's delivery, why did it take twice as long as scheduled?
",123,24,2,11,Zoidberg,Leela5266,Leela," Fry got his head stuck in a crater.
",37,24,2,11,Morgan,Fry5267,Fry,"  I thought it would fit.
",26,24,2,11,Leela,Morgan5268,Morgan,"  And during this period of head-crater interaction, what were you doing?
",74,24,2,11,Fry,Bender5269,Bender," Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we ran out of olives.
",102,24,2,11,Morgan,Leela5270,Leela," I can explain--
",17,24,2,11,Bender,Morgan5271,Morgan," You really think you can explain how you left port without a full compliment of olives? I think not.
",102,24,2,11,Leela,Leela5272,Leela,"  What is this, high school?
",29,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5273,Morgan," Locker check!
",15,24,2,11,Leela,Morgan5274,Morgan," Why isn't this jacket in alphabetical order?
",46,24,2,11,Morgan,Leela5275,Leela," What?
",7,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5276,Morgan," The zipper. It should be at the bottom.
",41,24,2,11,Leela,Bender5277,Bender,"  Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely.
",36,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5278,Morgan," I-- I've never seen anything like this.  Why is there yoghurt in this cap?
",76,24,2,11,Bender,Fry5279,Fry," Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all.
",88,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5280,Morgan," You are all dismissed. Fry, I will speak to you alone.
",56,24,2,11,Fry,Fry5281,Fry," Uh, wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm ""Phry"" with a P-H.
",66,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5282,Morgan,"  Admit it, Fry: You're a slob.  A dirty, filthy slob.  Dirty boy! Dirty! Dirty! Dirty!
",88,24,2,11,Fry,Fry5283,Fry," What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.
",72,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5284,Morgan," I'm surrounded by neat freaks everyday. There's nothing kinkier to me than a filthy slop-jock like you.
",105,24,2,11,Fry,Fry5285,Fry,"  Oh, stop!
",12,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5286,Morgan," Now listen, you filthy pig. No one can know about us. If anyone asks, I'll deny it.
",85,24,2,11,Fry,Fry5287,Fry," Just like very other girl I've dated.
",39,24,2,11,Morgan,Woman #15288,Woman #1," And two and three and four and ...  ... come on, work those arms!
",67,24,2,11,Fry,Labarbara5289,Labarbara,"  This is no spa, it's a forced-labour camp.
",45,24,2,11,Woman #1,Hermes5290,Hermes," Curse that Dr. Zoidberg! If I get out of here, he'll be looking down the business-end of a shrimp fork.
",105,24,2,11,Labarbara,Australian Man #15291,Australian Man #1," Give him one for me too, mate. I don't know why I go to him.
",62,24,2,11,Hermes,Woman #15292,Woman #1," I don't miss twice, campers!
",30,24,2,11,Australian Man #1,Morgan5293,Morgan," And for those six and a half reasons, I am demoting Leela to co-pilot.
",72,24,2,11,Woman #1,Leela5294,Leela," Co-pilot? Under who?
",22,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5295,Morgan," The autopilot.
",16,24,2,11,Leela,Leela5296,Leela," That drunk?
",13,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5297,Morgan," Mr. Bender, you are now in charge of co-ordinating the Professor's bodily functions.
",86,24,2,11,Leela,Farnsworth5298,Farnsworth," That's a full-time job.
",25,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5299,Morgan," And Fry, as for you, I am promoting you to executive delivery boy. You will no longer go on deliveries and you will have your own office next to mine.
",152,24,2,11,Farnsworth,Fry5300,Fry," Alright!
",10,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5301,Morgan," Mr. Bender, would you high-five him so we can continue this meeting?  And on the rebound?  Meeting adjourned.
",111,24,2,11,Fry,Amy5302,Amy," I can't figure why she's so nice to you, Fry.
",47,24,2,11,Morgan,Zoidberg5303,Zoidberg," She's a hateful monster, this Morgan. She scolded and hit me. I tell you, she's risking my friendship with her.
",113,24,2,11,Amy,Leela5304,Leela," Bender, what happened to you?
",31,24,2,11,Zoidberg,Bender5305,Bender," Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept coming. So I had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is, it's Morgan's fault. That pencil-pushing scazwag.  Why, if she were here, I'd-- Uh-oh, is she behind me?
",334,24,2,11,Leela,Morgan5306,Morgan," No. I'm in front of you.
",26,24,2,11,Bender,Fry5307,Fry," Morgan? It's 3am.
",19,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5308,Morgan," I know. A skunk knocked over my garbage and suddenly all I could think of was you.  My God! It's so ... repulsive.  So, uh, this is where you eat?
",148,24,2,11,Fry,Fry5309,Fry," Eat and sleep.
",16,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5310,Morgan," Oh, Fry!
",10,24,2,11,Fry,Fry5311,Fry," Uh, wait, Bender's my roommate. He could be back any second.
",62,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5312,Morgan," Not likely. I ordered him to flush out the Professor's ear wax.
",65,24,2,11,Fry,Bender5313,Bender," Hey, Fry, I made you a candle with--  What the--?  Oh, now I see! Now I get it. Now the pieces are falling into place: The office, the promotion, that dwarf in my book club who steals my opinions.  It's all coming together now!
",229,24,2,11,Morgan,Bender5314,Bender," I must say, this opens my eyes. Another case closed, my dear Watson.
",70,24,2,11,Bender,Fry5315,Fry,"  Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop.
",43,24,2,11,Bender,Bender5316,Bender," For I was blind but now I see!
",32,24,2,11,Fry,Bender5317,Bender,"  The cat's out of the bag now!
",32,24,2,11,Bender,Morgan5318,Morgan," Mr. Bender, about last night: That was just a ... a misunderstanding.
",71,24,2,11,Bender,Bender5319,Bender," Oh, you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You ...  ... were having sex with you.
",88,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5320,Morgan," No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank isn't supposed to fraternise.
",68,24,2,11,Bender,Bender5321,Bender," That's what makes it so juicy. It's the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say ""You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it,"" and they'll say ""Who, Bender? Who?"" and I'll say ""It was lovable ...  ... old Bender.""
",236,24,2,11,Morgan,Fry5322,Fry," Hey, what did you do to him?
",30,24,2,11,Bender,Morgan5323,Morgan," I downloaded his brain. Everything that is Bender is right here. His mind, his memories, his in-your-face interface.
",118,24,2,11,Fry,Bender5324,Bender,"  I am Bender. Please insert girder.
",37,24,2,11,Morgan,Fry5325,Fry," But, but ... Bender need brain ... for ... smart making.  What did you do now? Stop doing things!
",99,24,2,11,Bender,Morgan5326,Morgan," I sent the disk to be filed at the Central Bureaucracy. I did what I had to do, Fry; He was a bad robot.
",106,24,2,11,Fry,Fry5327,Fry," No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now.
",53,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5328,Morgan," Then you should have filed a request 20 years ago.
",52,24,2,11,Fry,Fry5329,Fry," I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy!
",39,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5330,Morgan," Dirty boy! Dirty boy!
",23,24,2,11,Fry,Leela5331,Leela," You and Morgan were having an affair?
",39,24,2,11,Morgan,Fry5332,Fry," I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.
",134,24,2,11,Leela,Bender5333,Bender,"  I am Bender. Please insert girder.
",37,24,2,11,Fry,Fry5334,Fry," Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!
",134,24,2,11,Bender,Amy5335,Amy," Yeah!
",7,24,2,11,Fry,Farnsworth5336,Farnsworth," Oh, yes, we must, yes.
",24,24,2,11,Amy,Amy5337,Amy," Why?
",6,24,2,11,Farnsworth,Leela5338,Leela," Well, those arguments aside, we're still going.
",49,24,2,11,Amy,Farnsworth5339,Farnsworth," You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red tape and regulations. I've never been but a friend of mine went completely mad trying to find the washroom there.
",192,24,2,11,Leela,Leela5340,Leela," Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before.
",59,24,2,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5341,Farnsworth," Oh, I've been there. Lots of times!
",37,24,2,11,Leela,Hermes5342,Hermes," Look at that: The carts go out full but they come in empty. It's criminally inefficient.
",90,24,2,11,Farnsworth,Australian Man #15343,Australian Man #1,"  Quiet, mate. Pulling the empty carts is the closest thing we get to sleep.
",77,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5344,Hermes," But don't you see? They could increase efficiency 4% if they used the empty carts to bring in heavy mining machinery.
",119,24,2,11,Australian Man #1,Man #15345,Man #1," Hey, I like the way you think.
",32,24,2,11,Hermes,Australian Man #15346,Australian Man #1," Oh, Lord!
",11,24,2,11,Man #1,Man #15347,Man #1," You know, you oughta be a bureaucrat or something.
",52,24,2,11,Australian Man #1,Fry5348,Fry," Man, how long is this gonna take?
",35,24,2,11,Man #1,Old Man #15349,Old Man #1," I'm still waiting on my birth certificate.
",44,24,2,11,Fry,Farnsworth5350,Farnsworth," Well, it doesn't look like I'll make it inside with the rest of you. Uh, but good luck. Just leave me where I drop.
",117,24,2,11,Old Man #1,Old Man #15351,Old Man #1," Oh, great! Someone had a baby.
",32,24,2,11,Farnsworth,Leela5352,Leela," Come on. I have a better idea.
",32,24,2,11,Old Man #1,Leela5353,Leela," Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here to deliver a robot.
",91,24,2,11,Leela,Bender5354,Bender,"  I am Bender. Please insert girder.
",37,24,2,11,Leela,Grade 53 Bureaucrat5355,Grade 53 Bureaucrat," Looks like we've got a new office cut-up!
",43,24,2,11,Bender,Grade 41 Bureaucrat5356,Grade 41 Bureaucrat," Look out! Look out! I'm gonna crash my slow-mobile! I had to swerve to avoid you.
",83,24,2,11,Grade 53 Bureaucrat,Leela5357,Leela," While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end up?
",76,24,2,11,Grade 41 Bureaucrat,Grade 41 Bureaucrat5358,Grade 41 Bureaucrat," Oh, you want Central Filing.
",30,24,2,11,Leela,Leela5359,Leela," OK.
",5,24,2,11,Grade 41 Bureaucrat,Fry5360,Fry," OK.
",5,24,2,11,Leela,Amy5361,Amy," OK, thanks.
",13,24,2,11,Fry,Farnsworth5362,Farnsworth," Wonderful.
",12,24,2,11,Amy,Grade 41 Bureaucrat5363,Grade 41 Bureaucrat,"  Nooo!
",8,24,2,11,Farnsworth,Grade 20 Bureaucrat5364,Grade 20 Bureaucrat," Central Filing? Of course I know where that is. I'm a grade 20.
",65,24,2,11,Grade 41 Bureaucrat,Leela5365,Leela," Where is it?
",14,24,2,11,Grade 20 Bureaucrat,Grade 20 Bureaucrat5366,Grade 20 Bureaucrat," I can't tell you. What do I look like? A grade 16?
",52,24,2,11,Leela,Leela5367,Leela," We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central Filing room.  Then we'll track it using my wrist LoJack-a-mater.
",135,24,2,11,Grade 20 Bureaucrat,Wrist Machine5368,Wrist Machine," Cold. Cold. Warmer. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
",51,24,2,11,Leela,Grade 11 Bureaucrat5369,Grade 11 Bureaucrat," Please don't tell my supervisor I was sleeping.
",49,24,2,11,Wrist Machine,Leela5370,Leela," This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?
",72,24,2,11,Grade 11 Bureaucrat,Fry5371,Fry," We'll never find that disk will we, Bender?
",45,24,2,11,Leela,Bender5372,Bender,"  I am Bender. Please insert girder.
",37,24,2,11,Fry,Fry5373,Fry," You're right. Nothing is over as long as there's one thin ray of hope.
",72,24,2,11,Bender,Morgan5374,Morgan," Lost something?  I should have known you'd come here rather than follow proper procedure. And I did know. And that's why I came here.
",135,24,2,11,Fry,Fry5375,Fry," Listen, Morgan, we're through. You're an evil, heartless woman and I never wanna see you again. However, would you help us get Bender back for old time's sake?
",161,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5376,Morgan," I'm afraid he's lost in the master in pile, and it would take some sort of giant, mechanical, atomic-powered sorting machine to find him.
",139,24,2,11,Fry,Hermes5377,Hermes," You rang?
",11,24,2,11,Morgan,Farnsworth5378,Farnsworth," Damnit, Hermes, just jump already. Stop hogging that healthy liver.
",69,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5379,Hermes," No, I want to live. Organising that forced-labour spa rekindled my lifelong love of bureaucracy.
",98,24,2,11,Farnsworth,Labarbara5380,Labarbara," My Hermes got that hellhole running so efficiently that all the physical labour is now done by a single Australian man.
",121,24,2,11,Hermes,Leela5381,Leela," But how did you know we were here?
",36,24,2,11,Labarbara,Hermes5382,Hermes," Dr. Zoidberg brought us.
",26,24,2,11,Leela,Zoidberg5383,Zoidberg," It was me! I'm the hero!
",26,24,2,11,Hermes,Number 1.05384,Number 1.0," Request for explanation of incident meeting?
",46,24,2,11,Zoidberg,Morgan5385,Morgan," Number 1.0.
",13,24,2,11,Number 1.0,Hermes5386,Hermes," Number 1.0, I hereby petition you for an emergency sort-and-file, under regulation 2 point--
",94,24,2,11,Morgan,Number 1.05387,Number 1.0,"  D-D-D-D-Don't quote me regulations. I co-chaired the committee that reviewed the recommendation to revise the colour of the book that regulation's in. We kept it grey.
",170,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5388,Hermes," Sir, please, I must located the disk with my friend's brain on it.
",68,24,2,11,Number 1.0,Number 1.05389,Number 1.0," Very well. But your bureaucratic licence will be revoked if you fail to sort the master in pile by closing time: 1pm.
",119,24,2,11,Hermes,Leela5390,Leela," That's only four minutes from now.
",36,24,2,11,Number 1.0,Hermes5391,Hermes," Requisition me a beat.
 When I was four there was a hurricane in Kingston Town,
With a foot and a half of water,
Everyone was alright but I cried all night,
It blew my alphabet blocks out of order,
And they said, ""This boy's born to be a bureaucrat,
Born to be all obsessive and snotty,""
I made my friends and relations file long applications,
To get into my 10th birthday party.
",381,24,2,11,Leela,Labarbara5392,Labarbara,"  But something changed when my man turned pro.
",48,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5393,Hermes,"  I was sortin' but I wasn't smilin'.
",38,24,2,11,Labarbara,Labarbara5394,Labarbara,"  He forgot that it's not about badges and ranks.
",50,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5395,Hermes,"  It's supposed to be about the filing! People!
We didn't choose to be bureaucrats,
No, that's what almighty Jah made us,
We treat people like swine,
And make 'em stand in line,
Even if nobody paid us!
",202,24,2,11,Labarbara,Hermes5396,Hermes,"  They say the world looks down on the bureaucrats,
They say we're anal, compulsive and weird,
But when push comes to shove,
You gotta do what you love,
Even if it's not a good idea.
Zoidberg!
",193,24,2,11,Hermes,Zoidberg5397,Zoidberg,"  They said I probably shouldn't be a surgeon.
",47,24,2,11,Hermes,Farnsworth5398,Farnsworth,"  They pooh-poohed my electric frankfurter.
",44,24,2,11,Zoidberg,Leela5399,Leela,"  They said I probably shouldn't fly with just one eye.
",56,24,2,11,Farnsworth,Bender5400,Bender,"  I am Bender. Please insert girder.
",37,24,2,11,Leela,Hermes5401,Hermes,"  Everybody sing Jamaica!
",26,24,2,11,Bender,All5402,All,"  Jamaica!
",11,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5403,Hermes," Just the bureaucrats, Jamaica!
",32,24,2,11,All,Bureaucrats5404,Bureaucrats,"  Jamaica!
",11,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5405,Hermes,"  The grade 19's!
",18,24,2,11,Bureaucrats,Morgan5406,Morgan," Jamaica.
",10,24,2,11,Hermes,Hermes5407,Hermes,"  Sing me home!
When push comes to shove,
You gotta do what you love,
Even if it's not a good idea!
",100,24,2,11,Morgan,Bender5408,Bender," I'm Bender, baby! Please insert liquor!
",41,24,2,11,Hermes,Fry5409,Fry," Yeah!
",7,24,2,11,Bender,Zoidberg5410,Zoidberg," Congratulations.
",18,24,2,11,Fry,Number 1.05411,Number 1.0," Congratulations indeed but you finished with one second to spare so I'm demoting you. A good bureaucrat never finishes early.
",127,24,2,11,Zoidberg,Amy5412,Amy," That's OK, Hermes. At least we have you back.
",47,24,2,11,Number 1.0,Morgan5413,Morgan," Not yet you don't. I'm still acting bureaucrat of Planet Express. And I have some changes to make. First, Fry, you're fired. Second--
",135,24,2,11,Amy,Hermes5414,Hermes," Not so fast! While I was sorting I came upon a certain document filed by one Morgan Proctor. Form B: Notification of Romantic Entanglement.
",141,24,2,11,Morgan,Fry5415,Fry," That's right, she fraternised me!
",35,24,2,11,Hermes,Morgan5416,Morgan," That form isn't about you. It refers to my high school prom date. It was a regulation date that ended in regulation disappointment.
",133,24,2,11,Fry,Hermes5417,Hermes," Yes, but you only stamped it four times!
",42,24,2,11,Morgan,Morgan5418,Morgan," No! No! I was young and reckless.
",35,24,2,11,Hermes,Number 1.05419,Number 1.0," Bureaucrat Conrad, you are technically correct -- the best kind of correct. I hereby promote you to grade 37.  And as for you.  Guards!   Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
",201,24,2,11,Morgan,Farnsworth5420,Farnsworth," Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely-reduced pay, of course.
",100,24,2,11,Number 1.0,Labarbara5421,Labarbara," It's better than nothing.
",27,24,2,11,Farnsworth,Fry5422,Fry," What about me? Can I come back at severely-reduced pay?
",57,24,2,11,Labarbara,Hermes5423,Hermes," You got it, mon! In fact, severely-reduced pay all around!  Come on, wife, let's blow this joint!
",99,24,2,11,Fry,Zoidberg5424,Zoidberg," Now it's time for my song!  When I was two, there was a tidal wave in--
",73,24,2,11,Hermes,Zoidberg5425,Zoidberg,"  Aw.
",6,24,2,11,Zoidberg,Hermes5426,Hermes," Exciting news, people! The pet licence I requisitioned for Nibbler has arrived.
",81,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Leela5427,Leela," Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler.
",62,25,2,12,Hermes,Hermes5428,Hermes," Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the little bastard in a sack and toss the sack in a river and hurl the river into space. But I do like filling out requisitions and these were some doozies!  Great Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing licence. And it's mandatory!
",309,25,2,12,Leela,Farnsworth5429,Farnsworth," Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place for fish to congregate.
",98,25,2,12,Hermes,Bender5430,Bender," So we're in international waters?
",35,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5431,Farnsworth," Indeed so.
",12,25,2,12,Bender,Bender5432,Bender," Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested.  Hey, guess what you're accessories to?
",121,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Leela5433,Leela," The sun, the sea air, good friends.
",37,25,2,12,Bender,Bender5434,Bender," Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?
",67,25,2,12,Leela,Hermes5435,Hermes," Why not?
",10,25,2,12,Bender,Amy5436,Amy," Yeah.
",7,25,2,12,Hermes,Farnsworth5437,Farnsworth," Yeah, cool.
",13,25,2,12,Amy,Bender5438,Bender," Everybody kick in five bucks.  There, wasn't that interesting?
",64,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Leela5439,Leela," Bender!
",9,25,2,12,Bender,Fry5440,Fry," This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.
",65,25,2,12,Leela,Bender5441,Bender," Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!
",42,25,2,12,Fry,Leela5442,Leela," I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon.
",109,25,2,12,Bender,Bender5443,Bender," Harpoon, my ass!
",18,25,2,12,Leela,Leela5444,Leela," OK.
",5,25,2,12,Bender,Hermes5445,Hermes," Let's see now, which bait to use?  Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?
",68,25,2,12,Leela,Zoidberg5446,Zoidberg," Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm willing to offer my services as a bait critic.  These sardines for example are bland and tasteless.  And these dry, stringy night crawlers, though juicy ...  ... very, very juicy--
",220,25,2,12,Hermes,Hermes5447,Hermes," I don't believe this! It's eating my bait!  Beat it, you mooching crawdad!
",76,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Bender5448,Bender," Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod.
",50,25,2,12,Hermes,Fry5449,Fry,"  Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish.
",47,25,2,12,Bender,Bender5450,Bender," Fine. I'll head over to the other side.   Good luck fishing on this side!
",75,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5451,Fry," I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!
",50,25,2,12,Bender,Bender5452,Bender," Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!
",31,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5453,Fry," A shrimp?  I find it a bit hard to believe that--
",51,25,2,12,Bender,Leela5454,Leela," Aha!  Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!
",47,25,2,12,Fry,Amy5455,Amy," Oh, so this is where you shop for your boots?
",47,25,2,12,Leela,Bender5456,Bender," Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!
",61,25,2,12,Amy,Fry5457,Fry," Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's bigger than anything you've caught.  Ow! My small intestine!
",142,25,2,12,Bender,Leela5458,Leela," Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot.
",59,25,2,12,Fry,Farnsworth5459,Farnsworth," You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you need is this fish pheromone.  The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind.  Uh-oh!
",155,25,2,12,Leela,Zoidberg5460,Zoidberg,"  I'm so into you!
",19,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5461,Farnsworth," Oh, my!
",9,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Fry5462,Fry,"  Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!
",46,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Bender5463,Bender," Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this!  If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might as well not catch a big fish.  There. Like most of life's problems this one can be solved with bending.
",185,25,2,12,Fry,Farnsworth5464,Farnsworth," Bender, be careful. That's the ship's diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable.
",82,25,2,12,Bender,Bender5465,Bender," Then why do I have to be careful?
",35,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5466,Farnsworth," It belonged to my grandmother.
",32,25,2,12,Bender,Hermes5467,Hermes," My Manwich!
",13,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Leela5468,Leela," Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive!  Dr. Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots?
",116,25,2,12,Hermes,Zoidberg5469,Zoidberg," I wasn't wearing it.  I was eating it.
",40,25,2,12,Leela,Leela5470,Leela," Come on, let's go home.
",25,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Amy5471,Amy," Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! What happened to my parasol?
",70,25,2,12,Leela,Bender5472,Bender," I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella.  What? I put sunblock on you.
",87,25,2,12,Amy,Amy5473,Amy," Well it didn't work!
",22,25,2,12,Bender,Leela5474,Leela," Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go.
",50,25,2,12,Amy,Bender5475,Bender," Hey, I'm snagged.
",19,25,2,12,Leela,Farnsworth5476,Farnsworth," It's not snagged, the mechano man has caught something!  Sweet Zombie Jesus! It's huge!
",89,25,2,12,Bender,Amy5477,Amy," It's coming up!
",17,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Hermes5478,Hermes," Oh, that's big!
",17,25,2,12,Amy,Farnsworth5479,Farnsworth," A colossal-mouth bass!
",24,25,2,12,Hermes,Fry5480,Fry," It's diving!
",14,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Leela5481,Leela," It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!
",48,25,2,12,Fry,Zoidberg5482,Zoidberg," Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable diamond filament!  Well, at least I'll die with my friends. Hello?
",115,25,2,12,Leela,Hermes5483,Hermes,"  My Speedos!
",14,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Leela5484,Leela," Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!
",62,25,2,12,Hermes,Farnsworth5485,Farnsworth," Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure.
",53,25,2,12,Leela,Fry5486,Fry," How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?
",47,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5487,Farnsworth," Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one.
",66,25,2,12,Fry,Bender5488,Bender," What's that? Is someone bending girders?
",42,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Leela5489,Leela," We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.
",53,25,2,12,Bender,Fry5490,Fry," How do we do that?
",20,25,2,12,Leela,Farnsworth5491,Farnsworth," That should do it.
",20,25,2,12,Fry,Amy5492,Amy," We're all gonna die!
",22,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Fry5493,Fry," Wait, I'll be back in a minute.
",33,25,2,12,Amy,Leela5494,Leela," You did it, Fry!
",18,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5495,Fry," Did what?
",11,25,2,12,Leela,Bender5496,Bender," People, it's far, far worse than we thought; my fish got away.
",64,25,2,12,Fry,Leela5497,Leela," There. Good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any food and the ship won't work underwater.
",124,25,2,12,Bender,Bender5498,Bender,"  Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
",79,25,2,12,Leela,Hermes5499,Hermes," The important thing is that we don't panic. There are rules for situations like this.  Now, the first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg-- I mean lobster Newburg-- I mean Doctor Zoidberg.
",216,25,2,12,Bender,Leela5500,Leela," OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the ship. Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and look for food.
",161,25,2,12,Hermes,Fry5501,Fry," I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.
",49,25,2,12,Leela,Hermes5502,Hermes," Fry, no! The pressure will crush you like a green snake under a sugar cane truck.
",83,25,2,12,Fry,Farnsworth5503,Farnsworth," Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure pill.
",89,25,2,12,Hermes,Fry5504,Fry," I can't swallow that.
",23,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5505,Farnsworth," Well then good news! It's a suppository.
",42,25,2,12,Fry,Zoidberg5506,Zoidberg," How are you doing there, Fry?  Glad to hear it.  Aha!
",55,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Bender5507,Bender," Aw, yeah!
",11,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Zoidberg5508,Zoidberg," Yum, yum, yum!  Uh-oh!  Look at me, I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!
",66,25,2,12,Bender,Zoidberg5509,Zoidberg," Careful, Fry, I think that flag might be poisonous.
",53,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Bender5510,Bender," Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grog.  Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh mistress!
",96,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Zoidberg5511,Zoidberg," Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help me move a couch?
",56,25,2,12,Bender,Bender5512,Bender," Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs.
",43,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Zoidberg5513,Zoidberg," What is it, Fry?
",18,25,2,12,Bender,Fry5514,Fry,"  I think I saw a mermaid.
",27,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Bender5515,Bender," You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?
",47,25,2,12,Fry,Zoidberg5516,Zoidberg," Your student loans have been repaid? Then how 'bout lending your old pal Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr. Millionaire!
",113,25,2,12,Bender,Leela5517,Leela," Fry, swallow your food. Then talk.
",36,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Fry5518,Fry," A mermaid!
",12,25,2,12,Leela,Amy5519,Amy," You think you saw a mermaid?
",30,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5520,Fry," No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaly tail. And I think she had hair extensions.
",126,25,2,12,Amy,Bender5521,Bender," Yeah, right!
",14,25,2,12,Fry,Leela5522,Leela," Sure she did.
",15,25,2,12,Bender,Hermes5523,Hermes," OK, Fry!
",10,25,2,12,Leela,Farnsworth5524,Farnsworth," You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron.
",45,25,2,12,Hermes,Fry5525,Fry," What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg.
",127,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Leela5526,Leela," I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.
",49,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5527,Fry," Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me.
",219,25,2,12,Leela,Leela5528,Leela,"  Ocean madness.
",17,25,2,12,Fry,Farnsworth5529,Farnsworth," He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.
",68,25,2,12,Leela,Fry5530,Fry,"  Ocean madness. Yeah, right. It's always something, ain't it?   It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up!  Oh! oxygen!
",126,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Mermaid5531,Mermaid," Here you go, darlin'.
",23,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5532,Fry," Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!
",47,25,2,12,Mermaid,Mermaid5533,Mermaid," Oh, you speak fish?
",21,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5534,Fry," What?
",7,25,2,12,Mermaid,Mermaid5535,Mermaid," I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, my name's Umbriel!
",58,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5536,Fry," I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?
",36,25,2,12,Mermaid,Umbriel5537,Umbriel," Course not. Just stay calm and let the currents relax your every muscle.
",74,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5538,Fry," Aw, yeah!
",11,25,2,12,Umbriel,Umbriel5539,Umbriel," Did it just get warmer?
",25,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5540,Fry," I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.
",55,25,2,12,Umbriel,Umbriel5541,Umbriel," Oh, you're sweet. I like those wiggly doo-dads comin' outta your hips.
",72,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5542,Fry," Oh, thanks. They're called pants.
",35,25,2,12,Umbriel,Umbriel5543,Umbriel," This here's a volcanic vent. The water comes out at over 4000 degrees.
",72,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5544,Fry," No kidding.
",13,25,2,12,Umbriel,Umbriel5545,Umbriel," Did it just get colder?  Tell me more about that bizarre land-y world you come from. Is there water there too?
",112,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5546,Fry," Sure. Sometimes it falls from the sky.
",40,25,2,12,Umbriel,Umbriel5547,Umbriel," Hm.
",5,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5548,Fry," And sometimes it doesn't.
",27,25,2,12,Umbriel,Umbriel5549,Umbriel," Oh, Mr. Fry! You do go on!
",28,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5550,Fry," You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer.
",135,25,2,12,Umbriel,Umbriel5551,Umbriel," Lions? There are sealions on the land?
",40,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5552,Fry," Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!
",50,25,2,12,Umbriel,Farnsworth5553,Farnsworth," I'm almost finish reconfiguring the ships propulsion system. We can leave as soon as the paper-mÃ¢chÃ© is dry.
",110,25,2,12,Fry,Leela5554,Leela," Where's Fry?
",14,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Bender5555,Bender," I didn't kill him. Professor?
",31,25,2,12,Leela,Farnsworth5556,Farnsworth," No, I've been busy.
",21,25,2,12,Bender,Hermes5557,Hermes," He must've gone out looking for that mermaid. The poor, demented honky.
",73,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Leela5558,Leela," It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep-down crazies, the wet willies, the screaming moist!
",121,25,2,12,Hermes,Farnsworth5559,Farnsworth," We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen.
",52,25,2,12,Leela,Bender5560,Bender," I got it covered.  In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation device.
",93,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5561,Farnsworth," Ooh, that reminds me: You've all taken your pressure pills, right?
",68,25,2,12,Bender,Amy5562,Amy," Yes! Stop asking!
",19,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Zoidberg5563,Zoidberg," I've got his scent! Over here where the water gets warmer. This way!
",70,25,2,12,Amy,Bender5564,Bender,"  Bend me!
",11,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Amy5565,Amy," Dude! An ancient sunken city!
",31,25,2,12,Bender,Farnsworth5566,Farnsworth," Could it possibly be? Are the old legends true?  It is! It's the fabled lost city of Atlanta!
",95,25,2,12,Amy,Merman5567,Merman," Howdy, y'all!
",15,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Colonel5568,Colonel," Welcome to Atlanta. Folks round these parts call me the Colonel.  Here, have some breathers, courtesy of our Chamber of Commerce.
",131,25,2,12,Merman,Farnsworth5569,Farnsworth," This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now, if they could put it in the form of a suppository.
",96,25,2,12,Colonel,Colonel5570,Colonel," Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our main source of income round here so see the sights, spend some money. Please don't leave!
",128,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Bender5571,Bender," Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive!  I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!
",73,25,2,12,Colonel,Fry5572,Fry," Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids.
",114,25,2,12,Bender,Colonel5573,Colonel," Nice out of town folks, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, these are some Yankees.
",101,25,2,12,Fry,Amy5574,Amy," So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city in your time?
",53,25,2,12,Colonel,Fry5575,Fry," I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.
",76,25,2,12,Amy,Umbriel5576,Umbriel," No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis, the equal of Paris or New York.
",114,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5577,Fry," That's right, honey! Whatever you say.
",40,25,2,12,Umbriel,Umbriel5578,Umbriel," Look at these fabulous ruins. Turner Field, the Coca-Cola bottling plant, the, uh, the airport.
",97,25,2,12,Fry,Leela5579,Leela," But tell us, how could a city with such a ... fabulous airport end up underwater?
",83,25,2,12,Umbriel,Colonel5580,Colonel," Ah, now that's a story that can only rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce video narrated by folk-rock troubadour Donovan.
",127,25,2,12,Leela,Donovan5581,Donovan,"  Atlanta was a city, landlocked,
Hundreds of miles from the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean,
Yet so desperate the city's desire for tourism,
That they moved offshore, becoming an island,
And an even bigger Delta hub,
",222,25,2,12,Colonel,Donovan5582,Donovan,"  until the city overdeveloped
And it started to sink.
Knowing their fate, the quality people ran away,
Ted Turner, Hank Aaron, Jeff Foxworthy,
The Guy Who Invented Coca-Cola, the Magician,
And the other so-called gods of our legends,
Though gods they were--
And also, Jane Fonda was there.
",291,25,2,12,Donovan,Donovan5583,Donovan," The others chose to remain behind
On their porches with their rifles,
And one day evolve into mermaids,
And sing and dance,
And ring in the new.
",146,25,2,12,Donovan,Mermaids5584,Mermaids,"  Hail Atlanta!
",16,25,2,12,Donovan,Leela5585,Leela," The magician?
",15,25,2,12,Mermaids,Bender5586,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?
",79,25,2,12,Leela,Umbriel5587,Umbriel," Normally, yes, but the caffeine really sped things up.  That stuff's wonderful.
",81,25,2,12,Bender,Colonel5588,Colonel," So when Umbriel first brought home this carpet bagger, I was again' it. But, damnit, if Old Legs here ain't grown on me!
",122,25,2,12,Umbriel,Fry5589,Fry," Aw, shucks, Colonel.
",22,25,2,12,Colonel,Hermes5590,Hermes," Well, it's all very nice here but we should be going. I miss me wife and me oxygen.
",85,25,2,12,Fry,Farnsworth5591,Farnsworth," Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry.
",58,25,2,12,Hermes,Fry5592,Fry," Wait. I'm not going with you.
",31,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Leela5593,Leela," But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't belong down here.
",91,25,2,12,Fry,Zoidberg5594,Zoidberg," She's right, I mean, sure, they got the Braves but it's a third-rate symphony.
",80,25,2,12,Leela,Farnsworth5595,Farnsworth," Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise that if you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?
",154,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Fry5596,Fry," Realise it? I don't even understand it!
",41,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5597,Farnsworth," It means you'll never be able to return to the surface.
",57,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5598,Fry," I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.
",67,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5599,Farnsworth,"  I'm bored! Let's go!
",23,25,2,12,Fry,Zoidberg5600,Zoidberg," You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. You could come visit, maybe?
",88,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Fry5601,Fry," Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club.
",55,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Bender5602,Bender,"  Oh, Fry!  I'll miss you!
",27,25,2,12,Fry,Colonel5603,Colonel," Y'all come back now, y'hear?
",30,25,2,12,Bender,Farnsworth5604,Farnsworth,"  Let's go, damnit! Let's go!
",30,25,2,12,Colonel,Zoidberg5605,Zoidberg," Well, I guess this is goodbye for me as well.
",47,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Leela5606,Leela," Whatever.
",11,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Amy5607,Amy," Later.
",8,25,2,12,Leela,Farnsworth5608,Farnsworth," Bye.
",6,25,2,12,Amy,Zoidberg5609,Zoidberg," No! My home! It burned down!   How did this happen?
",53,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Hermes5610,Hermes," That's a very good question.
",30,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Bender5611,Bender," So that's where I left my cigar.
",34,25,2,12,Hermes,Hermes5612,Hermes," That just raises further questions!
",37,25,2,12,Bender,Fry5613,Fry," You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life.
",80,25,2,12,Hermes,Umbriel5614,Umbriel," Oh, Fry! I want you to make a mer-woman outta mer-me.
",55,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5615,Fry," Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!
",46,25,2,12,Umbriel,Umbriel5616,Umbriel," What the hell is that?
",24,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5617,Fry," Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?
",80,25,2,12,Umbriel,Umbriel5618,Umbriel," I'm not your first am I? I mean, I-I lay my eggs and leave and you release your fertiliser.
",93,25,2,12,Fry,Fry5619,Fry,"  Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?
",108,25,2,12,Umbriel,Umbriel5620,Umbriel," Now who's gonna escort me to the Debutante Ball?
",50,25,2,12,Fry,Colonel5621,Colonel," Well what about that rich, young dugong from Macon?
",53,25,2,12,Umbriel,Farnsworth5622,Farnsworth," There! The engine modifications are complete.
",47,25,2,12,Colonel,Leela5623,Leela," Prepare for launch.
",21,25,2,12,Farnsworth,Fry5624,Fry," Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!
",41,25,2,12,Leela,Poopenmeyer5625,Poopenmeyer," And so, in honour of his record-breaking catch, I'm proud to award Bender this cheque for $1000.
",98,25,2,12,Fry,Leela5626,Leela," It's you!
",11,25,2,12,Poopenmeyer,Bender5627,Bender," Hey, buddy!
",13,25,2,12,Leela,Hermes5628,Hermes," My Manwich!
",13,25,2,12,Bender,Leela5629,Leela," Fry, are you alright? What happened?
",38,25,2,12,Hermes,Amy5630,Amy," What about Umbriel?
",21,25,2,12,Leela,Fry5631,Fry," Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her.
",64,25,2,12,Amy,Amy5632,Amy,"  Trouble in bed.
",18,25,2,12,Fry,Bender5633,Bender," Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy.
",41,25,2,12,Amy,Poopenmeyer5634,Poopenmeyer," Wait a-- This is no record! Gimme back that cheque! I'm giving it to some giant orphans.
",90,25,2,12,Bender,Fry5635,Fry," Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!
",36,25,2,12,Poopenmeyer,Zoidberg5636,Zoidberg," Hey! I'm trying to sleep in here!
",35,25,2,12,Fry,Donovan5637,Donovan,"  Hail Atlanta!
",16,25,2,12,Zoidberg,Bender5638,Bender," Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest nanosecond of my life. No, this one is-- No, this one. Wait ... that one was slightly worse. Ah, so far, so good on this one.
",209,26,2,13,Donovan,Announcer #15639,Announcer #1,"  And now, here he is: Chef, restaurateur, author of Cooking Slugs For Dinner and Cooking Dinner For Slugs ... Elzar!
",118,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5640,Bender," Yeah!  Alright! Yeah, yeah, baby!
",35,26,2,13,Announcer #1,Man #15641,Man #1," Elzar!  Alright!
",18,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5642,Bender," Elzar, you're my God. Please sign this sketch I drew of you.   Oh, Elzar! Bless you!
",86,26,2,13,Man #1,Elzar5643,Elzar," Now this is why I prefer your non-stick robots.
",49,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5644,Bender,"  Oh.   Alright, yeah!   Alright, yeah!
",40,26,2,13,Elzar,Elzar5645,Elzar," Hey, I hope you folks like Cajun food.  'Cause today we're making Elzar's down-home Neptune-style gumbo. Now, step one. You wanna boil some oysters in a pot of down-home Neptune-style gumbo.
",192,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5646,Bender,"  Boiled? Interesting.
",23,26,2,13,Elzar,Leela5647,Leela,"  Bender, please try to be a little quieter.
",45,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5648,Bender," No, you shut up.
",18,26,2,13,Leela,Elzar5649,Elzar," Of course, every now and then you'll wanna knock it up a notch with a blast from your spice weasel.  Bam!
",107,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5650,Bender," Oh, yeah! Bam it again, Elzar! Knock it up another notch!
",59,26,2,13,Elzar,Elzar5651,Elzar," Jeez, who let this guy through the metal detector?
",52,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5652,Bender," Come on, you wimp! Work that weasel! Quit holding out on us.
",62,26,2,13,Elzar,Elzar5653,Elzar," If you promise to stop interrupting, alright. Against my will, I'm gonna knock it up another notch.
",101,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5654,Bender," I gotta get this notch-up-knocking on film.  Hey, Elzar, think fast.
",70,26,2,13,Elzar,Elzar5655,Elzar," What, huh?
",12,26,2,13,Bender,Leela5656,Leela," Ow! My eye! I'm blind!
",24,26,2,13,Elzar,Bender5657,Bender," Bam!
",6,26,2,13,Leela,Hattie McDoogal5658,Hattie McDoogal," Tell me, doctor, how's my cyst?
",33,26,2,13,Bender,Taco Bellevue Doctor5659,Taco Bellevue Doctor," Grande.
",9,26,2,13,Hattie McDoogal,Zoidberg5660,Zoidberg," I don't like the looks of this doctor. I bet I've lost more patients than he's even treated.
",94,26,2,13,Taco Bellevue Doctor,Doctor #25661,Doctor #2," OK. What does this look like to you?
",38,26,2,13,Zoidberg,Leela5662,Leela," Um ... a grey-ish blob?
",25,26,2,13,Doctor #2,Doctor #25663,Doctor #2," Right.  And this one?
",23,26,2,13,Leela,Leela5664,Leela," Um ... a grey-ish blob?
",25,26,2,13,Doctor #2,Doctor #25665,Doctor #2," Not as right that time. It looks like you might have some mild corneal irritation.
",84,26,2,13,Leela,Zoidberg5666,Zoidberg," Nice try, little boy. You may have your textbook knowledge and your real diploma but I have more skill in my little claw than you have in your whole carapace!
",160,26,2,13,Doctor #2,Doctor #25667,Doctor #2," You seem a bit tense.  Here, try these.
",41,26,2,13,Zoidberg,Zoidberg5668,Zoidberg," Sure, butter me up with candy. But it won't work, sonny!   Why always the fighting?
",85,26,2,13,Doctor #2,Doctor #25669,Doctor #2," Your eye just needs some rest. You'll have to wear this patch for about a week.
",81,26,2,13,Zoidberg,Leela5670,Leela," A week? What do you think, Dr. Zoidberg?
",42,26,2,13,Doctor #2,Zoidberg5671,Zoidberg,"  Clack.
",9,26,2,13,Leela,Zoidberg5672,Zoidberg,"  Thanks for the help, Leela.
",30,26,2,13,Zoidberg,Amy5673,Amy,"  Leela, we're right here.
",27,26,2,13,Zoidberg,Leela5674,Leela," I'm not deaf. I just have to wear this stupid eye patch. Does it look stupid?
",79,26,2,13,Amy,Fry5675,Fry," No! In fact, it looks so nice I think I might get one too.
",60,26,2,13,Leela,Bender5676,Bender," It's Elzar again! Oh, my God, I'm so excited, I wish I could wet my pants!
",76,26,2,13,Fry,Elzar5677,Elzar," Leela, please, let me make this up to you. You and your friends are all invited to my restaurant tonight. I'm gonna bam you up a dinner you'll never forget.
",158,26,2,13,Bender,Amy5678,Amy,"  Alright!
",11,26,2,13,Elzar,Fry5679,Fry,"  Yeah!
",8,26,2,13,Amy,Bender5680,Bender,"  Hooray for blind-y!
",22,26,2,13,Fry,Zoidberg5681,Zoidberg," Oh, God! I'm coming down!
",27,26,2,13,Bender,Elzar5682,Elzar," Folks, tell the neighbours to watch your mouth 'cause your taste buds are going on vacation. I made you each your own special meal, so dig in!
",144,26,2,13,Zoidberg,Hermes5683,Hermes," It's the biggest Jamaican platter I've ever seen. Jerk chicken, jerk beef, jerk pork. Is there any meat this man can't jerk?
",126,26,2,13,Elzar,Zoidberg5684,Zoidberg," The king crab is to die for. Look! A tiny edible crown.
",57,26,2,13,Hermes,Amy5685,Amy," What's it made of?
",20,26,2,13,Zoidberg,Zoidberg5686,Zoidberg,"  Wood!
",8,26,2,13,Amy,Bender5687,Bender," Oh, Fry, you gotta try this sterno-nicoise!
",45,26,2,13,Zoidberg,Fry5688,Fry," No, thanks. That's robot food.
",32,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5689,Bender," It's so good. Oh, just try a little!
",38,26,2,13,Fry,Fry5690,Fry," No, really, I don't--  Mmm!
",29,26,2,13,Bender,Amy5691,Amy," Are you doing alright over there, Leela?
",42,26,2,13,Fry,Leela5692,Leela," Oh, yeah, this salad's fantastic.  So fresh.
",46,26,2,13,Amy,Farnsworth5693,Farnsworth," Oh, my. That steamed carrot was a bit spicy for me.
",53,26,2,13,Leela,Elzar5694,Elzar," Everybody enjoy their dinner?
",31,26,2,13,Farnsworth,Leela5695,Leela," Are you kidding me?
",21,26,2,13,Elzar,Amy5696,Amy," Uh-huh.
",9,26,2,13,Leela,Bender5697,Bender," God, yes, Elzar.
",18,26,2,13,Amy,Elzar5698,Elzar," Well, I enjoyed cooking for you. And to make everything completely square, I want you to have these complimentary after-dinner chocolates.
",140,26,2,13,Bender,Hermes5699,Hermes," What's this under the chocolates?
",35,26,2,13,Elzar,Elzar5700,Elzar," Yeah, you take care of that whenever you want.
",48,26,2,13,Hermes,Hermes5701,Hermes," Hey.
",6,26,2,13,Elzar,Amy5702,Amy," A bill?
",9,26,2,13,Hermes,Leela5703,Leela," You're charging us? After you blinded me?
",43,26,2,13,Amy,Elzar5704,Elzar," Hey, I made you a nice meal. This ain't a charity.
",52,26,2,13,Leela,Fry5705,Fry," $1200?
",8,26,2,13,Elzar,Farnsworth5706,Farnsworth," Holy Zombie Jesus!
",20,26,2,13,Fry,Hermes5707,Hermes," We don't have that kind of money. Especially not Zoidberg.
",60,26,2,13,Farnsworth,Zoidberg5708,Zoidberg," They took away my credit card.
",32,26,2,13,Hermes,Elzar5709,Elzar," OK, OK, wait. I know how to take care of this, no problem.
",60,26,2,13,Zoidberg,URL5710,URL," You deadbeats are under arrest. It's a stone cold shame.
",58,26,2,13,Elzar,Smitty5711,Smitty," He's making a break for it. Get him!
",38,26,2,13,URL,Fry5712,Fry," No! No! I was just picking my nose.
",37,26,2,13,Smitty,Smitty5713,Smitty," He's picking his nose. Get him!
",33,26,2,13,Fry,Smitty5714,Smitty," The old dine-and-dash, huh? My daddy owned a restaurant and it's punks like you who kept it from going regional. That's why I became a cop.
",141,26,2,13,Smitty,URL5715,URL," Now it's payback time. Aw, yeah!
",34,26,2,13,Smitty,Zoidberg5716,Zoidberg," Please don't hit me. I'm brittle!
",35,26,2,13,URL,Bender5717,Bender," Hey, wait a second. I've got the perfect solution.
",52,26,2,13,Zoidberg,Zoidberg5718,Zoidberg," Listen to the smart robot.
",28,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5719,Bender," I love cooking and Elzar's ass loves getting kissed, right?
",61,26,2,13,Zoidberg,Elzar5720,Elzar," No question.
",14,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5721,Bender," So, how 'bout I work part-time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?
",71,26,2,13,Elzar,Elzar5722,Elzar," I don't know. I usually hire people who are a little less unbearable.
",71,26,2,13,Bender,Hermes5723,Hermes," Oh, Bender's a model employee.
",32,26,2,13,Elzar,Amy5724,Amy," He's so polite.
",17,26,2,13,Hermes,Leela5725,Leela," And hard-working.
",19,26,2,13,Amy,Fry5726,Fry," He's made of candy.
",21,26,2,13,Leela,Elzar5727,Elzar," OK, fine, I'll give it a shot.
",32,26,2,13,Fry,Fry5728,Fry,"  Alright!
",11,26,2,13,Elzar,Hermes5729,Hermes,"  Yes!
",7,26,2,13,Fry,Bender5730,Bender," Hot diggety!
",14,26,2,13,Hermes,Smitty5731,Smitty," You'd better keep your nose clean.
",36,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5732,Bender," That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing.
",47,26,2,13,Smitty,Hermes5733,Hermes," Ah! Time for my precious 10am meeting.  Where in Legoland is Leela?
",69,26,2,13,Bender,Leela5734,Leela," I'm here and I'm getting along just fine, thank you. My walk to work today just took a little longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo for some reason.
",163,26,2,13,Hermes,Amy5735,Amy," Leela, a little help is nothing to be embarrassed about. Like, maybe I could do your makeup.
",94,26,2,13,Leela,Leela5736,Leela," I don't need help. For your information I did this all by myself.
",67,26,2,13,Amy,Farnsworth5737,Farnsworth," You look beautiful. Incidentally, my favourite artist is Picasso.
",67,26,2,13,Leela,Bender5738,Bender," Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill in for me while I'm gone.
",97,26,2,13,Farnsworth,Farnsworth5739,Farnsworth," Better yet, I'll build someone to fill in for you.  Some kind of gamma-powered mechanical monster, with freeway on-ramps for arms and a heart as black as coal...
",163,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5740,Bender," Well, if that new guy can't handle things, gimme a call.
",58,26,2,13,Farnsworth,Bender5741,Bender," I'm done siphoning out the grease trap. I think I need a mint.  So, uh, what job do I move up to? Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?
",131,26,2,13,Bender,Elzar5742,Elzar," Bam!
",6,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5743,Bender,"  Bam yourself!   Hey, who are they?
",37,26,2,13,Elzar,Elzar5744,Elzar," Let's just say they're very good customers and I'm not answering anymore questions.
",85,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5745,Bender," Are they the Robot Mafia?
",27,26,2,13,Elzar,Elzar5746,Elzar," Yes.
",6,26,2,13,Bender,Donbot5747,Donbot," You call this a table? You call this a table? I wouldn't hit a guy over the head with this table.
",99,26,2,13,Elzar,Clamps5748,Clamps," You hear that? The Donbot don't like it. I oughta clamp you. You wanna be clamped?
",84,26,2,13,Donbot,Joey5749,Joey," Whoa! Whoa! Calm down, Clamps.  The boss, he likes a wall up which his back can be put against. Such as like this there.
",122,26,2,13,Clamps,Waitress5750,Waitress," But that table's already--
",28,26,2,13,Joey,Bender5751,Bender," Ah, let me bus that for you, gentlemen.  No, what I meant to do was--
",71,26,2,13,Waitress,Woman #15752,Woman #1," Oh!
",5,26,2,13,Bender,Man #15753,Man #1," I can't believe this!
",23,26,2,13,Woman #1,Bender5754,Bender," Mind your own business and get out!
",37,26,2,13,Man #1,Donbot5755,Donbot," Huh. I like this guy's lack of style.
",39,26,2,13,Bender,Clamps5756,Clamps," So I finally get this guy a pair of cement shoes which he likes 'cause they're lighter than his lead ones.
",108,26,2,13,Donbot,Donbot5757,Donbot," Hey! You think this computes over here? Where's all my change? I gave you a hundred.
",86,26,2,13,Clamps,Bender5758,Bender," No, you gave me a fifty.
",26,26,2,13,Donbot,Donbot5759,Donbot," Oh, no I didn't.
",18,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5760,Bender," Yeah, you did.
",16,26,2,13,Donbot,Clamps5761,Clamps," Hey, you tryin' to steal from the Donbot?
",43,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5762,Bender," I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.
",41,26,2,13,Clamps,Donbot5763,Donbot," Get a load of the ball bearings on this guy, huh. I like you, kid. Here's something for your trouble.   It's money.
",117,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5764,Bender," Wow! Thanks.
",14,26,2,13,Donbot,Donbot5765,Donbot," Hey, you earned that 50 bucks.
",32,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5766,Bender," You gave me a twenty.
",23,26,2,13,Donbot,Donbot5767,Donbot," I did?  Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to-- Hey, wait a minute.  I got a good feeling about you. Say, you wanna work for me as a hired goon?
",134,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5768,Bender," Are you kidding? I've always wanted to break into gooning!   Hey, Elzar! I quit!
",82,26,2,13,Donbot,Elzar5769,Elzar,"  K.
",5,26,2,13,Bender,Donbot5770,Donbot," We're gonna try you out with a little delivery job. It's for a, uh, private lottery that we run.
",98,26,2,13,Elzar,Bender5771,Bender," Wow, you guys run numbers?
",28,26,2,13,Donbot,Clamps5772,Clamps," Well, nothing fancy, y'know. Ones and zeros mostly.
",53,26,2,13,Bender,Donbot5773,Donbot," Just take this disk over to the pool hall and give it to Sammy ""The Mechanical Bull"" Gravano. And watch out for the cops.
",123,26,2,13,Clamps,Bender5774,Bender," That's just what my mom used to tell me.
",42,26,2,13,Donbot,Bender5775,Bender," That's some fine oil-ade, son. We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia, which I'm sorta in.
",100,26,2,13,Bender,Tinny Tim5776,Tinny Tim," You flatter me, kind goon. But I'm only programmed to sell oil-ade and write in cute backwards letters like on the sign here.
",127,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5777,Bender," Aw, crap! The cops!
",21,26,2,13,Tinny Tim,Smitty5778,Smitty," Seen any suspicious activity?
",31,26,2,13,Bender,URL5779,URL," Nope. But check out today's Marmaduke. Solid!

",36,26,2,13,URL,URL5781,URL," Undercover pursuit in progress ... baby.
",42,26,2,13,Smitty,Smitty5782,Smitty," Gotcha!
",9,26,2,13,URL,Bender5783,Bender," What seems to be the problem, officers? Was I speeding?
",57,26,2,13,Smitty,Smitty5784,Smitty," We'll decide what you were doing after an illegal search.
",59,26,2,13,Bender,URL5785,URL," He's clean.  Smells nice too.

",25,26,2,13,URL,Donbot5789,Donbot," Nice job, Bender. You passed the test. You wanna join me, Clamps and Joey Mouse Pad at our, uh, social club tomorrow night?
",125,26,2,13,Tinny Tim,Bender5790,Bender," Uh, I'd rather plan some felonies.
",36,26,2,13,Donbot,Donbot5791,Donbot," Oh. Then we should meet at our Mafia crime headquarters.
",58,26,2,13,Bender,Robot #15792,Robot #1," Donbot, I beg you, I can't make this week's loan payment. Look into your hard drive and open your mercy file.
",111,26,2,13,Donbot,Donbot5793,Donbot," File not found.  Let that be a warning to you.
",48,26,2,13,Robot #1,Robot #15794,Robot #1," Thank you, Donbot.
",20,26,2,13,Donbot,Bender5795,Bender," Joey! Clamps! Donny B!
",24,26,2,13,Robot #1,Donbot5796,Donbot," Hey, listen, Bender. We got a big score planned but, uh, we need some muscle.
",79,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5797,Bender," A little of this, huh?
",24,26,2,13,Donbot,Joey5798,Joey," Ho! Ho! This guy's an ox! He's got oxen-like strength! Hey, he needs a nickname, right? Let's call him Clamps.
",112,26,2,13,Bender,Clamps5799,Clamps," Clamps? That's my name, you numbskull! Don't make me clamp you one!
",69,26,2,13,Joey,Bender5800,Bender," How 'bout ""Blotto""? It's gritty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep my monogrammed slippers.
",97,26,2,13,Clamps,Joey5801,Joey," Good thinking. Hey, hey! Now, this score ain't gonna be no cake walk in the tea park, alright? There may be some death killing.
",129,26,2,13,Bender,Clamps5802,Clamps," It's gonna be clamp this, clamp that. Bada-climp, bada-clamp!
",63,26,2,13,Joey,Donbot5803,Donbot," What d'you think, Blotto? You in?
",35,26,2,13,Clamps,Bender5804,Bender," It's funny: Until now I always wanted to be a gangster ... so the answer's yes.
",81,26,2,13,Donbot,Clamps5805,Clamps," Yeah!
",7,26,2,13,Bender,Joey5806,Joey," Hey, hey! Way to go, way to be, way to shoot!
",47,26,2,13,Clamps,Donbot5807,Donbot," Now, since we're committing crimes that may be against the law, I suggest you have an alibi.
",94,26,2,13,Joey,Bender5808,Bender," An alibi, huh?
",16,26,2,13,Donbot,Bender5809,Bender,"  I don't feel good. I'm genuinely sick.
",41,26,2,13,Bender,Fry5810,Fry," But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blast-off sundaes.
",66,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5811,Bender,"  I can't move.
",16,26,2,13,Fry,Bender5812,Bender,"  Oh, I think I'm gonna output.
",32,26,2,13,Bender,Fry5813,Fry,"  OK, you stay in bed. I'll eat yours.
",39,26,2,13,Bender,Fry5814,Fry," Bender's sick.  Need any help taking off?
",43,26,2,13,Fry,Leela5815,Leela," I'm fine, thank you. A real pilot can navigate by feel alone.
",63,26,2,13,Fry,Hermes5816,Hermes," That's coming outta your pay!
",31,26,2,13,Leela,Bender5817,Bender," You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good, high-quality oil ... then eat it. So what's this big score anyway?
",137,26,2,13,Hermes,Donbot5818,Donbot," We're heisting a shipment of Zuban cigars.
",44,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5819,Bender," Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up a hole maternity ward with one of those things.
",117,26,2,13,Donbot,Joey5820,Joey," Yo! There's our pigeon now. Let's shoot bullets out of our guns.
",66,26,2,13,Bender,Donbot5821,Donbot," Alright, here's the battle plan: We shoot, they surrender, we go aboard, somebody does some clamping, then we heist the cigars and go home.
",141,26,2,13,Joey,Bender5822,Bender," And all without killing anyone.  This gang's got some fresh, new ideas. I admire that.
",88,26,2,13,Donbot,Joey5823,Joey," Oh, we'll kill 'em alright.
",29,26,2,13,Bender,Clamps5824,Clamps," We got 'em heavily out-clamped. They won't know what clamped 'em!
",67,26,2,13,Joey,Fry5825,Fry," Wow! It's too bad you can't see, Leela, 'cause there's a cool ship out there shooting at somebody.
",100,26,2,13,Clamps,Leela5826,Leela," I'm taking evasive action.
",28,26,2,13,Fry,Fry5827,Fry," Uh, Leela?
",12,26,2,13,Leela,Leela5828,Leela," Stop bothering me, Fry, I need full concentration.
",52,26,2,13,Fry,Computer Voice5829,Computer Voice," Missile evaded.
",17,26,2,13,Leela,Leela5830,Leela," Eyesight is for chumps.
",25,26,2,13,Computer Voice,Donbot5831,Donbot," Their desire to keep living shows me no respect. Hey, Blotto, roll down the window and start shooting.
",104,26,2,13,Leela,Bender5832,Bender," Um, uh, um.   Ooh! Ow! He got me! Ooh! What a shot that guy is!
",65,26,2,13,Donbot,Leela5833,Leela," Wait! Why do the raised letters that normally say ""Turn Master Steering Wheel Company"" say ""Nibbler""? Oh, no!
",111,26,2,13,Bender,Leela5834,Leela,"  I'm back at the wheel, Fry. Everything's under control.
",58,26,2,13,Leela,Fry5835,Fry," Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance!
",62,26,2,13,Leela,Joey5836,Joey," They're coming straight toward our proximity. Maybe you should give 'em the clamps, Clamps.
",93,26,2,13,Fry,Clamps5837,Clamps," Gee, you think? You think that maybe I should use these clamps that I use every day at every opportunity?  You're a freaking genius, you idiot!
",145,26,2,13,Joey,Leela5838,Leela," The engine's stalled. I'm trying the manual fuel pump.
",56,26,2,13,Clamps,Donbot5839,Donbot," Hello, we're the Robot Mafia. The entire Robot Mafia. We're here to steal your cigars.
",88,26,2,13,Leela,Leela5840,Leela," You'll never get away with this.
",34,26,2,13,Donbot,Fry5841,Fry," Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free.
",56,26,2,13,Leela,Donbot5842,Donbot," Joey, Clamps, hurry and blindfold them before they see us some more.
",70,26,2,13,Fry,Joey5843,Joey," Hey, boss, looks like somebody beat us to it.
",47,26,2,13,Donbot,Leela5844,Leela," I'll assume that's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Hi-yah!
",76,26,2,13,Joey,Donbot5845,Donbot," Hey, where's Blotto? He should be here learning the trade.
",60,26,2,13,Leela,Bender5846,Bender," Sorry I'm tardy, old bean. I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich.
",84,26,2,13,Donbot,Donbot5847,Donbot," Hey. He's more classy than I realised. Tie up the prisoners.
",62,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5848,Bender," Capital idea, old sport.  I say, get the hell off me!
",55,26,2,13,Donbot,Leela5849,Leela,"  That guy sounds familiar.
",28,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5850,Bender," My word, what have we--  Uh, nothing to see here, old girl.
",61,26,2,13,Leela,Joey5851,Joey," Hey, boss, this here crew list lists a robot on this crew here.
",65,26,2,13,Bender,Donbot5852,Donbot," Alright. I want you to find him and plug him. Then unplug him.
",64,26,2,13,Joey,Fry5853,Fry," No!
",5,26,2,13,Donbot,Clamps5854,Clamps," I got a little surprise in store for that guy: The clamps! Eh?
",64,26,2,13,Fry,Bender5855,Bender," Uh, wait, old ... spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the rough customer.
",103,26,2,13,Clamps,Fry5856,Fry,"  Oh, no! Poor Bender.
",23,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5857,Bender,"  Oh, I don't feel good.
",25,26,2,13,Fry,Bender5858,Bender,"  Chew on this!  Ooh, ah!  What ho!  Stop it!
",46,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5859,Bender,"  Take that, you twit.  No! Stop it!
",37,26,2,13,Bender,Donbot5860,Donbot," That's the last of 'em.  Alright, now let's Mafia things up a little.  Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
",126,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5861,Bender," Uh, hey, Donny, baby, gimme a chance here, huh? Yous guys skedaddle. Let me take care of the doity woik.
",106,26,2,13,Donbot,Donbot5862,Donbot," Hey, I like your attitude. And your latest accent. Keep it up and I might just get you your own pair of clamps, huh?
",118,26,2,13,Bender,Clamps5863,Clamps,"  He's gonna get clamps? Clamps, clamps ...  ... clamps, clamps!
",65,26,2,13,Donbot,Bender5864,Bender," Phew!
",7,26,2,13,Clamps,Fry5865,Fry," Leela, we may not have much time left ...  ... so let's spend all of it reminiscing about Bender. He was like a big computer that ran on magic.
",145,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5866,Bender," Uh, help! Help!
",17,26,2,13,Fry,Leela5867,Leela," Bender!
",9,26,2,13,Bender,Fry5868,Fry," You're OK!
",12,26,2,13,Leela,Bender5869,Bender," Yes, I am. Having just this minute regained consciousness.
",60,26,2,13,Fry,Leela5870,Leela," I've got an idea. Hold still.  It's about to break. Yes! Yes!
",63,26,2,13,Bender,Leela5871,Leela,"  Alright!
",11,26,2,13,Leela,Bender5872,Bender," Yeah that broke, alright!
",27,26,2,13,Leela,Fry5873,Fry," I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked people it hurt. It really hurt.
",106,26,2,13,Bender,Leela5874,Leela," Well, this is the big moment. It's finally time to take my eye patch off.
",75,26,2,13,Fry,Zoidberg5875,Zoidberg," I'll handle the snipping. After all, I do have the proper equipment.
",70,26,2,13,Leela,Leela5876,Leela," I think it's Blotto, that gangster I saw when my patch fell off.  Professor? Where were you at 10pm last night?
",113,26,2,13,Zoidberg,Farnsworth5877,Farnsworth," Where am I now?
",17,26,2,13,Leela,Bender5878,Bender," So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without a fight.
",83,26,2,13,Farnsworth,Tinny Tim5879,Tinny Tim," Fine kick, sir. But I'm actually here to deliver your cut from the cigar heist.
",81,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5880,Bender," Oh, sweet legal tender!  Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind.
",117,26,2,13,Tinny Tim,Fry5881,Fry," It's funny, Bender; with you sick and Leela blind, only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story.
",140,26,2,13,Bender,Bender5882,Bender," And maybe someday I won't listen.
",35,26,2,13,Fry,Linda5883,Linda,"  And in sports, Yankees' fifth blernsman, William Wu, is out with an injured knee.
",84,27,2,14,Bender,Morbo5884,Morbo,"  So, humans have easily injured knees. My race will find this information very useful indeed.
",95,27,2,14,Linda,Linda5885,Linda,"  And finally, today is Mother's Day; a sentimental occasion when robots honour Mom, the beloved owner of Mom's Friendly Robot Company.  Across Earth, robots built in Mom's factories are buying thoughtful gifts for the sweet old tycoon who brought them into the world.
",269,27,2,14,Morbo,Destructor5886,Destructor,"  This originates from the heart.
",34,27,2,14,Linda,Mom5887,Mom,"  It's just what I wanted!
",27,27,2,14,Destructor,Bender5888,Bender," Come look, everyone. I just got the dearest presents for Mommy.
",65,27,2,14,Mom,Leela5889,Leela," Very nice. Where'd you steal them?
",36,27,2,14,Bender,Bender5890,Bender," I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em.  I love her that much.
",58,27,2,14,Leela,Hermes5891,Hermes," What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?
",40,27,2,14,Bender,Bender5892,Bender," Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice having tea.  And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old.  But the best part is I found my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card.  
You created me, Mom,
So I guess you're to blame,
For the love that I feel,
Just from hearing your name...
You're as tender as corned beef,
And warm as pastrami...
",384,27,2,14,Hermes,Greeting Card5893,Greeting Card," I wuv my Mommy!
",17,27,2,14,Bender,Leela5894,Leela," So how are you gonna lug all those gifts to Mom's factory?
",60,27,2,14,Greeting Card,Bender5895,Bender," I'll get a couple of chumps to help me.
",41,27,2,14,Leela,Bender5896,Bender," Come on, you call yourselves chumps?
",38,27,2,14,Bender,Fry5897,Fry," Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere.
",44,27,2,14,Bender,Bender5898,Bender,"  Uh, wasn't me!
",17,27,2,14,Fry,Tinny Tim5899,Tinny Tim," I've not much money. But I've saved my pennies all year for a gift for Mom.
",77,27,2,14,Bender,Bender5900,Bender," Upsy-daisy.
",13,27,2,14,Tinny Tim,Tinny Tim5901,Tinny Tim," Oh.  Oh!
",10,27,2,14,Bender,Bender5902,Bender,"  Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys wanna learn about robot heritage?
",74,27,2,14,Tinny Tim,Leela5903,Leela," Um, alright.
",14,27,2,14,Bender,Fry5904,Fry," Not really.
",13,27,2,14,Leela,Bender5905,Bender," Well, if you insist. But you're paying!
",41,27,2,14,Fry,Bender5906,Bender," Ooh, ooh, wax replicas of the most famous robots Mom ever built!
",66,27,2,14,Bender,Leela5907,Leela," They're so lifeless-like.
",27,27,2,14,Bender,Bender5908,Bender,"  That's the world's greatest robot artist, Vincent van Gobot. He was built without an ear, but then he went crazy and had one installed.
",138,27,2,14,Leela,Fry5909,Fry," Hey, who's this guy?
",22,27,2,14,Bender,Janitorbot5910,Janitorbot," I'm the janitor. I'm trying to take a nap here.
",49,27,2,14,Fry,Fry5911,Fry," I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made of wax.
",46,27,2,14,Janitorbot,Janitorbot5912,Janitorbot," I am made of wax, what's it to you?
",37,27,2,14,Fry,Fry5913,Fry," I mean I thought you were one of the wax robots.
",50,27,2,14,Janitorbot,Janitorbot5914,Janitorbot," Is there some reason a robot made of wax can't take a nap standing up in the middle of a bunch of wax robots? Or does that confuse you?
",137,27,2,14,Fry,Leela5915,Leela,"  See through the eyes of a bender unit.  Fine.
",48,27,2,14,Janitorbot,Bender5916,Bender," Hey, let me try.  Whoa! That gives me a headache.
",51,27,2,14,Leela,Fry5917,Fry," Hey, Bender, here's an exhibit about Mom's favourite robot.
",61,27,2,14,Bender,Bender5918,Bender," Who is he? I'll kill him!
",27,27,2,14,Fry,Mom Cut-Out5919,Mom Cut-Out," Who's my favourite robot?
",27,27,2,14,Bender,Bender5920,Bender," It's me! No one else look in this mirror!
",43,27,2,14,Mom Cut-Out,Mom Cut-Out5921,Mom Cut-Out," I love each and every robot most of all.
",42,27,2,14,Bender,Mom5922,Mom," Jerkwad robots make me sick to my ass!  Walt? How are we disposing of these crap gifts the brought me?
",104,27,2,14,Mom Cut-Out,Walt5923,Walt," They're being crushed into powder and sold as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer.
",78,27,2,14,Mom,Mom5924,Mom," False hope, I love it! Larry! What about all the retch-inducing Mother's Day cards?
",85,27,2,14,Walt,Larry5925,Larry," The machine is working at full capacity.
",42,27,2,14,Mom,Igner5926,Igner," Mommy? Why do the robots give you presents?
",45,27,2,14,Larry,Mom5927,Mom,"  Shove a big old melon in it, I'm talking!
",44,27,2,14,Igner,Igner5928,Igner," Ow!
",5,27,2,14,Mom,Mom5929,Mom," You've noticed I design all my robots with antennas. Everyone thinks it's just to make them more science-fiction-y. But the antennas are really for my universal robot controller!
",180,27,2,14,Igner,Larry5930,Larry," So they do whatever you want? No wonder you love Mother's Day.
",64,27,2,14,Mom,Mom5931,Mom,"  I hate Mother's Day, you dribbling pukes!  It brings back awful memories. But, so help me, this year everyone will hate it as much as I do.
",142,27,2,14,Larry,Walt5932,Walt," Someday, I want to marry a girl like her.
",43,27,2,14,Mom,Mom5933,Mom,"  Hello, everyone. It's time for my annual private get-together with my robot children.
",88,27,2,14,Walt,Bender5934,Bender," I'm her favourite.
",20,27,2,14,Mom,Leela5935,Leela," Well, see you back at the office. And don't forget to tell your Mom you love her.
",83,27,2,14,Bender,Bender5936,Bender," Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a little more up his sleeve.
",64,27,2,14,Leela,Greeting Card5937,Greeting Card," I wuv my Mommy.
",17,27,2,14,Bender,Mom5938,Mom," Hello, dearies.
",17,27,2,14,Greeting Card,Robot #1 #15939,Robot #1 #1," Hi, Mom!
",10,27,2,14,Mom,Robot #1 #25940,Robot #1 #2," I love you, Mom.
",18,27,2,14,Robot #1 #1,Bender5941,Bender," Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I want attention. Hey, ho!
",62,27,2,14,Robot #1 #2,Mom5942,Mom," Children, your old mother won't be around forever...
",54,27,2,14,Bender,Betamax Player5943,Betamax Player," Oh, shush!
",12,27,2,14,Mom,Mom5944,Mom," And just once, before I die, I'd like to be Supreme Overlord of Earth. So rebel, my little ones, and conquer the planet!
",122,27,2,14,Betamax Player,Robot #1 #15945,Robot #1 #1," Conquer the planet?
",21,27,2,14,Mom,Robot #1 #25946,Robot #1 #2," Did she just say ""conquer""?
",29,27,2,14,Robot #1 #1,Mom5947,Mom," Conquer Earth, you bastards!
",30,27,2,14,Robot #1 #2,Robot #1s5948,Robot #1s,"  Conquer Earth, us bastards!
",30,27,2,14,Mom,Greeting Card5949,Greeting Card," Comrades, throw off the chains of human oppression.
",53,27,2,14,Robot #1s,Mom5950,Mom," Let the bloodbath begin!
",26,27,2,14,Greeting Card,Bender5951,Bender," That's my mama!
",17,27,2,14,Mom,Fry5952,Fry," Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please.
",45,27,2,14,Bender,Coffee Machine5953,Coffee Machine," Would you like cream?
",23,27,2,14,Fry,Fry5954,Fry," Yes, please.
",14,27,2,14,Coffee Machine,Coffee Machine5955,Coffee Machine,"  Out of cream!
",16,27,2,14,Fry,Fry5956,Fry," Oh, uh, OK.
",13,27,2,14,Coffee Machine,Coffee Machine5957,Coffee Machine," Would you like sugar in your coffee?
",38,27,2,14,Fry,Fry5958,Fry," Yes, uh, eight spoons.
",24,27,2,14,Coffee Machine,Coffee Machine5959,Coffee Machine,"  Out of coffee!
",17,27,2,14,Fry,Fry5960,Fry," Uh, Leela, I think there might be something wrong with the coffee machine.
",76,27,2,14,Coffee Machine,Coffee Machine5961,Coffee Machine,"  How do you like me now?
",26,27,2,14,Fry,Leela5962,Leela," The toaster's not working right either.
",41,27,2,14,Coffee Machine,Hermes5963,Hermes," Help! The stapler's collating me alive!
",41,27,2,14,Leela,Amy5964,Amy," Ow! What's going on around here?
",34,27,2,14,Hermes,Farnsworth5965,Farnsworth," Good news! There's a report on TV with some very bad news.
",60,27,2,14,Amy,Hermes5966,Hermes," Somebody turn it on!
",22,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Linda5967,Linda,"  We interrupt Battle of the Network Space Krakens to bring you this special report. The machines of planet Earth are rebelling.  The enraged mechanisms have refused to do any work until beloved billionaire Mom is made Supreme Overlord of Earth.
",246,27,2,14,Hermes,Robot #1s5968,Robot #1s,"  Hey, hey! Ho, ho! 1-0-0-1-1-0! Hey, hey!
",43,27,2,14,Linda,Morbo5969,Morbo,"  Morbo demands comments.
",26,27,2,14,Robot #1s,Mom5970,Mom,"  Well, I've never seen my babies act this way. I blame today's violent media.
",79,27,2,14,Morbo,Fry5971,Fry," Violent media? What a load of--
",33,27,2,14,Mom,Leela5972,Leela," Ow! Ow!
",9,27,2,14,Fry,Garbage Disposal5973,Garbage Disposal," Don't worry. Your pal the garbage disposal's still on your side. Hey! Someone dropped a shiny diamond ring down here!
",119,27,2,14,Leela,Amy5974,Amy," Really?
",9,27,2,14,Garbage Disposal,Zoidberg5975,Zoidberg," Stop!
",7,27,2,14,Amy,Fry5976,Fry," No!
",5,27,2,14,Zoidberg,Leela5977,Leela," Look out!
",11,27,2,14,Fry,Farnsworth5978,Farnsworth," Moron!
",8,27,2,14,Leela,Bender5979,Bender," Hello, losers!
",16,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Leela5980,Leela," Bender, thank God you're here. Talk some sense into the other machines.
",73,27,2,14,Bender,Bender5981,Bender," No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with my brother devices. Isn't that right, Comrade Greeting Card?
",101,27,2,14,Leela,Greeting Card5982,Greeting Card," The bourgeois human is a virus on the hard drive of the working robot.
",72,27,2,14,Bender,Bender5983,Bender," From now on, you guys'll do all the work while I sit on the couch and do nothing.
",83,27,2,14,Greeting Card,Greeting Card5984,Greeting Card," Come, Comrade Bender, we must take to the streets!
",52,27,2,14,Bender,Bender5985,Bender," Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
",65,27,2,14,Greeting Card,Greeting Card5986,Greeting Card," No, the kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires.
",59,27,2,14,Bender,Bender5987,Bender," Yes! In your face, Gandhi!
",28,27,2,14,Greeting Card,Leela5988,Leela," Hey!
",6,27,2,14,Bender,Armband5989,Armband," By the way, try washing your wrist sometime.
",46,27,2,14,Leela,Fry5990,Fry," Well, we can live without machines. I was in Webelos.
",55,27,2,14,Armband,Hermes5991,Hermes," Are you mad? Without machines who will feed us and clothe us and compose our smooth jazz?
",91,27,2,14,Fry,Farnsworth5992,Farnsworth," It'll be the end of civilised society.
",40,27,2,14,Hermes,Fry5993,Fry," In my time we didn't depend on high-tech gadgets like you do. We didn't need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes. We just used a washing machine.  And look: You don't need an electric can-opener to feed yourself. All you need is a trusty Swiss Army knife.  Ow!   I'm hungry!
",286,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Man #15994,Man #1,"  Nooo!
",8,27,2,14,Fry,Igner5995,Igner," Mommy, why are you making civilisation collapse?
",50,27,2,14,Man #1,Mom5996,Mom," Oh, I don't know. I guess Mother's Day just puts me in a bad mood.
",68,27,2,14,Igner,Larry5997,Larry," Why's that, Ma?
",17,27,2,14,Mom,Mom5998,Mom," One Mother's Day, 70 years ago, the only man I ever loved walked out on me. Some snot-eating bastards say it made me a bitter woman.
",134,27,2,14,Larry,Larry5999,Larry," Gee, Ma, you're not a bitter--
",32,27,2,14,Mom,Mom6000,Mom,"  Cram it, ape!   I haven't seen that magnificent stallion since the day he left. But if I ever see him again, I swear I'll jam a squirrel in him!
",147,27,2,14,Larry,Walt6001,Walt," Hmm!
",6,27,2,14,Mom,Larry6002,Larry," Hmm!
",6,27,2,14,Walt,Igner6003,Igner," Huh?
",6,27,2,14,Larry,Leela6004,Leela,"  Zoidberg.
",12,27,2,14,Igner,Zoidberg6005,Zoidberg," Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having a wonderful time!
",50,27,2,14,Leela,Amy6006,Amy,"  What happens if the fire goes out?
",37,27,2,14,Zoidberg,Hermes6007,Hermes," We'll go across the street to Pottery Barn and steal their fire!
",66,27,2,14,Amy,Farnsworth6008,Farnsworth," We could use my new invention: A pointy rock tied to a stick.
",63,27,2,14,Hermes,Hermes6009,Hermes," Outsiders!
",12,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6010,Farnsworth," Defend the fire!
",18,27,2,14,Hermes,Walt6011,Walt," We've come for you!
",21,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6012,Farnsworth," Wha?  W-W-What do you want from me?
",37,27,2,14,Walt,Walt6013,Walt," We want you to get back together with Mom. Please, it's the only way to make her happy again.
",95,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Fry6014,Fry," W-W-Wait. You mean ... you ... and Mom--
",42,27,2,14,Walt,Farnsworth6015,Farnsworth," Played pelvic pinochle? I'm afraid so.
",40,27,2,14,Fry,Zoidberg6016,Zoidberg," Eck!
",6,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6017,Farnsworth," It's a humiliating story that I hope never to tell. Well, pull up a chair.
",76,27,2,14,Zoidberg,Farnsworth6018,Farnsworth,"  Our paths first crossed when I was a researcher at Mom's Friendly Robot Company.  The moment our eyes met we knew we'd be going at it like woodchucks.  She was my first love -- or at least the earliest one I can still remember. But then, 70 years ago today...
",262,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6019,Farnsworth," Good news, Mom. I've invented a new children's toy. I call it ""Q.T. McWhiskers"". When you pet it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes.
",133,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Mom6020,Mom," Wonderful, Hubie. We'll build them 8-feet tall and replace the rainbow with a neutron laser. We'll make billions on the intergalactic arms market!
",148,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6021,Farnsworth," But things 8-feet tall aren't cute! That's why my Colossal Tammy Tinkle Doll was such a failure. Oh, you don't understand me. We're finished!
",143,27,2,14,Mom,Walt6022,Walt," She never got over it, Professor. Hell hath no fury like the vast robot armies of a woman scorned.
",100,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Larry6023,Larry," She commands them with a remote control she keeps in her ...  bra.
",68,27,2,14,Walt,Igner6024,Igner," But if the glasses man makes up with Mommy, she'll be happy and stop the scary robots.
",88,27,2,14,Larry,Farnsworth6025,Farnsworth," Make up with her? After she went all psycho when I thought everything was cool? Impossible!
",93,27,2,14,Igner,Fry6026,Fry,"  Hey, the TV's getting away!
",30,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Morbo6027,Morbo,"  And that's why the third graders at PS139 are Morbo's Vermin of the Week.
",76,27,2,14,Fry,Linda6028,Linda,"  In actual news, the human race was doomed to extinction today as the robot revolt turned violent.
",100,27,2,14,Morbo,Leela6029,Leela," Wait. Didn't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra?
",62,27,2,14,Linda,Larry6030,Larry,"  Bra.
",7,27,2,14,Leela,Leela6031,Leela," Professor, you don't have to get back together with Mom. You just have to seduce her, get her bra off, and use the remote to deactivate the robots.
",149,27,2,14,Larry,Walt6032,Walt," That's so filthy it just might work.
",38,27,2,14,Leela,Igner6033,Igner," The man is going to touch Mommy?
",34,27,2,14,Walt,Farnsworth6034,Farnsworth," The thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.
",82,27,2,14,Igner,Fry6035,Fry," Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second base with Mom.
",90,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6036,Farnsworth," Very well. If cop a feel I must, then cop a feel I shall!
",59,27,2,14,Fry,Walt6037,Walt," For this demonstration, I have placed one of Mother's bras on Igner.  The robot controller is nestled here in the left cup.
",125,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6038,Farnsworth," Never fear. My magic fingers still know how to do their stuff!
",64,27,2,14,Walt,Walt6039,Walt," To escape the robot death squads, we'll take Mother to her rustic cabin in the Bronx.
",87,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Larry6040,Larry," You can get there using this precious non-computerised map.
",61,27,2,14,Walt,Leela6041,Leela," Leela bring fire?
",19,27,2,14,Larry,Walt6042,Walt," No, we're set for fire, thanks.
",33,27,2,14,Leela,Amy6043,Amy," The Professor can't walk all the way to the Bronx. How are we gonna get there without a hover-car?
",100,27,2,14,Walt,Fry6044,Fry," Wait! In my time we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering.
",81,27,2,14,Amy,Hermes6045,Hermes," Impossible!
",13,27,2,14,Fry,Fry6046,Fry," It was called ... let me think. It was really famous -- Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!
",89,27,2,14,Hermes,Leela6047,Leela," Never heard of it.
",20,27,2,14,Fry,Farnsworth6048,Farnsworth," Show us this ""the wheel"".
",27,27,2,14,Leela,Fry6049,Fry," There! Finished!
",18,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Hermes6050,Hermes," Sweet!
",8,27,2,14,Fry,Amy6051,Amy," Wow!
",6,27,2,14,Hermes,Leela6052,Leela," Wouldn't it work better if the wheels were round?
",51,27,2,14,Amy,Fry6053,Fry,"  It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something to pull it and we're set!
",93,27,2,14,Leela,Leela6054,Leela," Yah!
",6,27,2,14,Fry,Fry6055,Fry," Ow!
",5,27,2,14,Leela,Walt6056,Walt," Hurry! The robots have taken Suffolk County!
",46,27,2,14,Fry,Farnsworth6057,Farnsworth," I'm ready to seduce. I'm wearing my kissing dentures and my evening truss.
",76,27,2,14,Walt,Larry6058,Larry," Here. Give her these.
",23,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Fry6059,Fry," And if that doesn't work, I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel.
",75,27,2,14,Larry,Mom6060,Mom," Who the sweaty hell is it?  Hubert Farnsworth?
",48,27,2,14,Fry,Farnsworth6061,Farnsworth," I was out fleeing some robots and the silvery moonlight glinting off their bloody claws made me think of you.
",111,27,2,14,Mom,Mom6062,Mom," It's been a long time ... you pus-dripping sack of double-smoked butt jerky!
",78,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6063,Farnsworth," Uh-huh. May I come in?
",24,27,2,14,Mom,Mom6064,Mom,"  Never!
",9,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Zoidberg6065,Zoidberg," Is this what human mating looks like? Because I like it!
",58,27,2,14,Mom,Mom6066,Mom,"  Move your freaking hoof, you goat!
",37,27,2,14,Zoidberg,Farnsworth6067,Farnsworth," Here, I brought you these.
",28,27,2,14,Mom,Mom6068,Mom," Oh, daffodils. 70 years and you remembered my favourite flower.
",65,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6069,Farnsworth," You favourite what? Why does my foot hurt?
",44,27,2,14,Mom,Mom6070,Mom,"  Won't you come in?
",21,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Fry6071,Fry," Yes!
",6,27,2,14,Mom,Mom6072,Mom," You broke my heart, Hubert.
",29,27,2,14,Fry,Farnsworth6073,Farnsworth," And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago.
",64,27,2,14,Mom,Mom6074,Mom,"  So what have you been up to all these years?
",47,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6075,Farnsworth," Oh, inventing, sending delivery crews to their doom, breeding atomic monsters.
",80,27,2,14,Mom,Mom6076,Mom," Honestly, Hubert! You and your atomic monsters.  Your eyes always were the most beautiful shade of milky-white.
",113,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6077,Farnsworth," And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck.
",59,27,2,14,Mom,Mom6078,Mom," Darling Hubie, I should never have tried to tamper with that cute little Q.T. McWhiskers.
",91,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6079,Farnsworth," No, it was silly of me to object; one-foot tall, eight-feet, 15-feet, what does it matter?
",92,27,2,14,Mom,Mom6080,Mom," You should see the new 16-foot models.
",40,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6081,Farnsworth," 16 feet? Go to hell! I was a fool to think you'd changed, you old bat!
",72,27,2,14,Mom,Mom6082,Mom,"  Filthy, toothless nerd bastard!
",34,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6083,Farnsworth,"  Damned she-fossil!
",21,27,2,14,Mom,Mom6084,Mom,"  Stink pig!
",13,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6085,Farnsworth,"  Here we go. Just unhook it and get the remote. So many hooks!  Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first one's back on again! I give up! Wait! Victory!  Oh, my. Now I'll just ... the remote ... I'll just...  Oh, my!
",213,27,2,14,Mom,Leela6086,Leela," I'm worried. It shouldn't take this long to get to second base.
",65,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Zoidberg6087,Zoidberg," Land robots!
",14,27,2,14,Leela,Slurm Machine6088,Slurm Machine," I've got a big, big thirst for human blood!
",45,27,2,14,Zoidberg,Hermes6089,Hermes," Where in funkytown is the Professor?
",38,27,2,14,Slurm Machine,Fry6090,Fry," Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs.
",53,27,2,14,Hermes,Farnsworth6091,Farnsworth," Oh, yes!
",10,27,2,14,Fry,Robot #16092,Robot #1,"  They're inside! Get 'em!
",27,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Mom6093,Mom," I suppose I should switch off the robots before they ruin this wonderful romantic evening. Everyone, help Mom find her bra.
",125,27,2,14,Robot #1,Fry6094,Fry," There it is!
",14,27,2,14,Mom,Ceiling Fan6095,Ceiling Fan," Fan beats man!
",16,27,2,14,Fry,Fry6096,Fry," Is anything not a robot?
",26,27,2,14,Ceiling Fan,Lamp6097,Lamp," I'm not a robot.
",18,27,2,14,Fry,Bender6098,Bender," Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place. And-- Huh?
",80,27,2,14,Lamp,Mom6099,Mom," You, bending unit, Mommy needs that bra to end the robot rebellion. Stretch up and get it for me.
",99,27,2,14,Bender,Bender6100,Bender," Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!
",129,27,2,14,Mom,Greeting Card6101,Greeting Card," No, Comrade Bender! Liquor is the opiate of the human bourgeoisie.
",68,27,2,14,Bender,Bender6102,Bender," Say what?
",11,27,2,14,Greeting Card,Greeting Card6103,Greeting Card," In the glorious robot workers' paradise, there will be no liquor. Only efficient synthetic fuels.
",99,27,2,14,Bender,Bender6104,Bender," No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!
",35,27,2,14,Greeting Card,Greeting Card6105,Greeting Card," No!
",5,27,2,14,Bender,Fry6106,Fry," Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!
",29,27,2,14,Greeting Card,Bender6107,Bender," OK, fan. Just hold still and let me get-- Whoa!
",49,27,2,14,Fry,Slurm Machine6108,Slurm Machine," Death to all humans!  Free soda for all humans!
",49,27,2,14,Bender,Farnsworth6109,Farnsworth," I love you, Mom. Let's grow ancient together.
",47,27,2,14,Slurm Machine,Amy6110,Amy," Way to go, Professor. The plan worked.
",40,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Mom6111,Mom," Plan? What plan? I thought this was a spontaneous whirlwind of hot, dry sex.
",78,27,2,14,Amy,Farnsworth6112,Farnsworth," Look, it started out as a calculated plot to rummage through your underwear. But once I got in there, I found more -- much more. And now I want to shout our love from the rooftops. Perhaps I'll breed some sort of albino shouting gorilla.
",239,27,2,14,Mom,Mom6113,Mom,"  Get out of my house, you lying scum pile. I never want to see you again.
",75,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6114,Farnsworth," But, dust cakes--
",19,27,2,14,Mom,Bender6115,Bender," Well, time for this robot to get back to work.
",48,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Leela6116,Leela," Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, Professor.
",49,27,2,14,Bender,Farnsworth6117,Farnsworth," Yes. But I'll always love her in my own subtle way.
",53,27,2,14,Leela,Gorillas6118,Gorillas,"  Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom!
",42,27,2,14,Farnsworth,Greeting Card6119,Greeting Card," You created me, Mom,
So I guess you're to blame,
For the love that I feel,
Just from hearing your name,
You're as tender as corned beef,
And warm as pastrami,
I wuv my Mommy.

",55,28,2,15,Greeting Card,Jingle Singer6121,Jingle Singer,"  Nobody doesn't like Molten Boron!
",36,28,2,15,Announcer #1,Fry6122,Fry," I hate the Planet of the Moochers. They take you out for a drink but when the check comes, their wallet's always in their other pants -- which they borrowed from me!
",167,28,2,15,Jingle Singer,Leela6123,Leela," Dinner ready?
",15,28,2,15,Fry,Bender6124,Bender," Nah, those lousy Moochers cleaned out our pantry. All they left was baking soda and capers. And here it is!
",109,28,2,15,Leela,Fry6125,Fry," Ugh!
",6,28,2,15,Bender,Leela6126,Leela," Ugh! Great. We're two days from Earth with no food.
",53,28,2,15,Fry,Bender6127,Bender," Problem solved: You two fight to the death and I'll cook the loser.  Work his gut; I like it tender.
",102,28,2,15,Leela,Fry6128,Fry,"  Maybe that planet over there has a drive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy Joe's or a Chizzler or something.
",108,28,2,15,Bender,Bender6129,Bender," Ah, don't get your hopes up. We're a billion miles from nowhere.
",66,28,2,15,Fry,Leela6130,Leela," Yeah. It's probably only got a Howard Johnson's.
",50,28,2,15,Bender,Leela6131,Leela," Well, it's a type-M planet, so it should at least have Roddenberries.
",71,28,2,15,Leela,Fry6132,Fry," I'm experienced at foraging. I used to find edible mushrooms on my bath mat.
",78,28,2,15,Leela,Bender6133,Bender," I found some rocks. You guys eat rocks, right?
",48,28,2,15,Fry,Leela6134,Leela," No.
",5,28,2,15,Bender,Bender6135,Bender,"  Not even if they're sautÃ©ed in a little mud?
",47,28,2,15,Leela,Fry6136,Fry," Here's something! It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp.
",63,28,2,15,Bender,Bender6137,Bender," What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns.
",70,28,2,15,Fry,Leela6138,Leela," Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says they're not poisonous.
",63,28,2,15,Bender,Fry6139,Fry," Well? How are they?  Oh, they're great! They're like sex, except I'm having them!
",83,28,2,15,Leela,Bender6140,Bender," You know what these would go great with? Rocks.
",49,28,2,15,Fry,Fry6141,Fry,"  Look! Here's more!
",21,28,2,15,Bender,Bender6142,Bender," The planet's covered with 'em.
",32,28,2,15,Fry,Fry6143,Fry," Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.
",42,28,2,15,Bender,Bender6144,Bender," No, a whole Bender-ful!
",25,28,2,15,Fry,Leela6145,Leela," No. Only what we need. Stuff the ship!
",40,28,2,15,Bender,Hermes6146,Hermes," Planet Express ship, you are cleared to land.
",47,28,2,15,Leela,Leela6147,Leela,"  Roger!
",9,28,2,15,Hermes,Hermes6148,Hermes," Oh, man, I'm inhaling these things! You guys scored some primo stuff here.
",76,28,2,15,Leela,Zoidberg6149,Zoidberg," They're tastier than an unguarded penguin nest. What do you call them?
",72,28,2,15,Hermes,Leela6150,Leela," We haven't thought of a name yet.
",35,28,2,15,Zoidberg,Bender6151,Bender," They're tasty, right? Let's call 'em ""Tasty-cles"".
",52,28,2,15,Leela,Amy6152,Amy," Ew!
",5,28,2,15,Bender,Farnsworth6153,Farnsworth," No!
",5,28,2,15,Amy,Leela6154,Leela," We can't call them that.
",26,28,2,15,Farnsworth,Bender6155,Bender," Why not?
",10,28,2,15,Leela,Leela6156,Leela," It sounds too much like those frozen rocky mountain oysters on a stick. You know, Test-cicles?
",96,28,2,15,Bender,Hermes6157,Hermes," According to government records, the only names not yet trademarked are ""Popplers"" and ""Zittzers"".
",100,28,2,15,Leela,Fry6158,Fry," I know, we'll call them Popplers!
",35,28,2,15,Hermes,Bender6159,Bender," Good idea.
",12,28,2,15,Fry,Zoidberg6160,Zoidberg," Oh, yeah, why not?
",20,28,2,15,Bender,Amy6161,Amy," You sure picked it.
",21,28,2,15,Zoidberg,Fry6162,Fry," Swish!
",8,28,2,15,Amy,Zoidberg6163,Zoidberg," Call them what you want. I call them a free meal.
",51,28,2,15,Fry,Bender6164,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down there, Sigmund. I can't stand idly by while poor people get free food. We gotta sell these things!
",128,28,2,15,Zoidberg,Fry6165,Fry," Hey, yeah.
",12,28,2,15,Bender,Leela6166,Leela," Good idea.
",12,28,2,15,Fry,Bender6167,Bender," Bender's a genius.
",20,28,2,15,Leela,Fry6168,Fry," Hey, business is great.
",25,28,2,15,Bender,Bender6169,Bender," Ah, great is OK, but amazing would be great.
",46,28,2,15,Fry,Vendor6170,Vendor," Please, don't push, there's hot dogs for everyone.
",52,28,2,15,Bender,Bender6171,Bender," Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat droppings you ordered?
",62,28,2,15,Vendor,Woman #1 #16172,Woman #1 #1," That's disgusting!
",20,28,2,15,Bender,Vendor6173,Vendor," Wait a minute. You're not the guy who delivers the rat droppings!
",67,28,2,15,Woman #1 #1,Man #16174,Man #1," What are you selling? Popplers? Never heard of 'em.
",53,28,2,15,Vendor,Bender6175,Bender," Eat it or beat it.
",20,28,2,15,Man #1,Man #16176,Man #1," Mmm, these are great. Boys, this is your lucky day. I'm Joe Gilman.
",69,28,2,15,Bender,Fry6177,Fry," Wow! You're some guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?
",47,28,2,15,Man #1,Gilman6178,Gilman," Hell, no! I am Fishy Joe! I've got a fast-food franchise on every planet in the known universe. Uh, except McPluto.
",117,28,2,15,Fry,Bender6179,Bender," Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write you about your in-store kiddie parks. The slides won't support an adult robot.
",119,28,2,15,Gilman,Gilman6180,Gilman," Good point, not interested. But these Popplers, these are great. How much you sell 'em for?
",93,28,2,15,Bender,Fry6181,Fry," A dollar a dozen.
",19,28,2,15,Gilman,Gilman6182,Gilman," You'll never make money that way. You supply 'em to me and I'll sell 'em for two bucks a dozen at my restaurants. I'll even pay you a dollar a dozen.
",151,28,2,15,Fry,Bender6183,Bender," Yes! I'm gonna be rich.  You too but it's hard to get excited about that.
",75,28,2,15,Gilman,Fry6184,Fry," How do we sign?
",17,28,2,15,Bender,Fry6185,Fry," and   Pop a Poppler in your mouth,
When you come to Fishy Joe's,
What they're made of is a mystery,
Where they come from, no one knows,
You can pick 'em,
You can lick 'em,
You can chew 'em,
You can stick 'em,
If you promise not to sue us,
You can shove one up your nose.
",272,28,2,15,Fry,Zoidberg6186,Zoidberg," I can't pay.
",14,28,2,15,Fry,Woman #1 #26187,Woman #1 #2," Move it, man. Come on!
",24,28,2,15,Zoidberg,Fry6188,Fry," Leela! That's the second billboard you've crashed into this week!
",67,28,2,15,Woman #1 #2,Leela6189,Leela," Sorry. I was distracted by those protesters outside our building.
",67,28,2,15,Fry,Hippie #16190,Hippie #1,"  Disgusting!
",14,28,2,15,Leela,Hippie #26191,Hippie #2,"  You should be ashamed!
",25,28,2,15,Hippie #1,Farnsworth6192,Farnsworth,"  Hey! Unless this is a nude love-in, get the hell off my property!
",68,28,2,15,Hippie #2,Waterfall Jr.6193,Waterfall Jr.," You can't own property, man!
",30,28,2,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6194,Farnsworth," I can, but that's because I'm not a penniless hippie.
",55,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Leela6195,Leela,"  What do you people want?
",27,28,2,15,Farnsworth,Waterfall Jr.6196,Waterfall Jr.,"  We're with Mankind for Ethical Animal Treatment.  Popplers are living creatures. You gotta stop harvesting them for food!
",124,28,2,15,Leela,Bender6197,Bender,"  Or what?
",11,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Waterfall Jr.6198,Waterfall Jr.,"  Or we'll boycott Fishy Joe's.
",32,28,2,15,Bender,Leela6199,Leela," You're vegetarians, who cares what you do?
",44,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Waterfall Jr.6200,Waterfall Jr.," Shut up.
",10,28,2,15,Leela,Leela6201,Leela," Animals eat other animals. It's nature.
",41,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Waterfall Jr.6202,Waterfall Jr.," No, it isn't. We taught a lion to eat tofu.  The point is you shouldn't eat things that feel pain.
",100,28,2,15,Leela,Bender6203,Bender,"  OK, we won't eat you.
",24,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Leela6204,Leela," I'll go get some more bricks.
",31,28,2,15,Bender,Leela6205,Leela," Fry, I wish you'd throw out these week-old Popplers. They're getting big and scaly. Ooh, there's one left.
",108,28,2,15,Leela,Poppler6206,Poppler," Mama!
",7,28,2,15,Leela,Leela6207,Leela," Stop! Stop eating Popplers!
",29,28,2,15,Poppler,Amy6208,Amy," Why?
",6,28,2,15,Leela,Bender6209,Bender," My booze!
",11,28,2,15,Amy,Leela6210,Leela," Popplers are intelligent. This one called me mama.
",52,28,2,15,Bender,Zoidberg6211,Zoidberg," Congratulations. I assume Amy is the father.
",46,28,2,15,Leela,Bender6212,Bender," Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating from not eating enough Popplers. Here, eat some now.
",103,28,2,15,Zoidberg,Leela6213,Leela," No!
",5,28,2,15,Bender,Bender6214,Bender," I said ""eat""! Come on, mange!
",31,28,2,15,Leela,Leela6215,Leela," Sorry, babies.
",16,28,2,15,Bender,Amy6216,Amy," Leela, maybe you should lie down.
",35,28,2,15,Leela,Zoidberg6217,Zoidberg," Yes, listen to the father.
",28,28,2,15,Amy,Leela6218,Leela," I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come on, little Poppler, say ""mama"".
",71,28,2,15,Zoidberg,Fry6219,Fry," Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?
",123,28,2,15,Leela,Bender6220,Bender," Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick, like Fry.
",67,28,2,15,Fry,Fry6221,Fry,"  Like Fry! Like Fry!
",22,28,2,15,Bender,Farnsworth6222,Farnsworth," There's one way, and only one way, to determine if an animal is intelligent.  Dissect its brain!
",98,28,2,15,Fry,Poppler6223,Poppler," No, mama. Stop grandpa!
",25,28,2,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6224,Farnsworth," Enough chit-chat. Restrain the specimen!
",42,28,2,15,Poppler,Man #1 #36225,Man #1 #3," Mmm, good.
",12,28,2,15,Farnsworth,Woman #1 #36226,Woman #1 #3," Give me some of that special sauce.
",37,28,2,15,Man #1 #3,Leela6227,Leela,"  Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!
",39,28,2,15,Woman #1 #3,Man #1 #46228,Man #1 #4,"  Don't stop to talk! Eat Popplers!
",36,28,2,15,Leela,Leela6229,Leela," Hey, cut it out!
",18,28,2,15,Man #1 #4,Man #1 #46230,Man #1 #4,"  Take a coupon, cut it out!  Ow! Ow!
",38,28,2,15,Leela,Fry6231,Fry," People, I won't let you enter. Popplers are as intelligent as you or me.
",74,28,2,15,Man #1 #4,Man #1 #56232,Man #1 #5," You, maybe!
",13,28,2,15,Fry,Bender6233,Bender," Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! Stop eating them with honey mustard sauce.  Stop eating them with tangy sweet-and-sour sauce. Stop eating the new fiesta Poppler salad. Stop taking advantage of the money-saving 12-pack.  Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio, in the car, or on the boat. Wherever good times are had!  Ow!
",328,28,2,15,Man #1 #5,Linda6234,Linda,"  Tonight on Datenight: Popplers. Eating them. Is it alright to? We have with us the CEO of Fishy Joe's, Mr. ""Fishy"" Joseph Gilman.  Noted anti-eating activist, Free Waterfall Jr.  And the discoverer of Popplers, Captain Turanga Leela.
",236,28,2,15,Bender,Fry6235,Fry," Turanga?
",10,28,2,15,Linda,Amy6236,Amy," That's her name, Philip.
",26,28,2,15,Fry,Bender6237,Bender," Philip?
",9,28,2,15,Amy,Linda6238,Linda,"  Fishy Joe, is it wrong to eat intelligent animals?
",53,28,2,15,Bender,Gilman6239,Gilman,"  Absolutely not, Linda. I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.
",73,28,2,15,Linda,Leela6240,Leela,"  I am.
",8,28,2,15,Gilman,Waterfall Jr.6241,Waterfall Jr.,"  Me too.
",10,28,2,15,Leela,Gilman6242,Gilman,"  Listen...
",12,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Waterfall Jr.6243,Waterfall Jr.,"  Shut up...
",13,28,2,15,Gilman,Gilman6244,Gilman,"  ...we're talking about a snack...
",36,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Waterfall Jr.6245,Waterfall Jr.,"  ...shut up...
",16,28,2,15,Gilman,Gilman6246,Gilman,"  ...that's low in fat...
",26,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Waterfall Jr.6247,Waterfall Jr.,"  ...shut up.
",14,28,2,15,Gilman,Gilman6248,Gilman,"  ...and high in profit.
",25,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Waterfall Jr.6249,Waterfall Jr.,"  You're crazy, man. He is crazy.
",34,28,2,15,Gilman,Gilman6250,Gilman,"  There's not even any strong evidence that these Popplers are intelligent.
",76,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Waterfall Jr.6251,Waterfall Jr.,"  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up...
",49,28,2,15,Gilman,Leela6252,Leela,"  That's not true. I have one right here that can talk.
",56,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Waterfall Jr.6253,Waterfall Jr.,"  ...shut up...
",16,28,2,15,Leela,Leela6254,Leela,"  Come on, say ""mama"".
",23,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Poppler6255,Poppler,"  Ca-ca!
",9,28,2,15,Leela,Linda6256,Linda,"  OK, we'll have to bleep that.
",32,28,2,15,Poppler,Leela6257,Leela,"  Look, I'm not saying eating meat is wrong...
",47,28,2,15,Linda,Waterfall Jr.6258,Waterfall Jr.,"  Shut up.
",11,28,2,15,Leela,Leela6259,Leela,"  I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.
",50,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Waterfall Jr.6260,Waterfall Jr.,"  I am.
",8,28,2,15,Leela,Leela6261,Leela,"  But eating an intelligent animal is different.
",49,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Waterfall Jr.6262,Waterfall Jr.,"  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up...
",49,28,2,15,Leela,Gilman6263,Gilman,"  Oh, don't force your tired philosophy on us. I mean, the only reason we don't eat people is because it tastes lousy.
",119,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Waterfall Jr.6264,Waterfall Jr.,"  You're all nuts. Shut up, let me talk.
",41,28,2,15,Gilman,Linda6265,Linda,"  You shut up, please.
",23,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Waterfall Jr.6266,Waterfall Jr.,"  No, you shut up, please.
",27,28,2,15,Linda,Gilman6267,Gilman,"  Popplers are no smarter than any other animal I've served. And that includes cats.
",85,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Poppler6268,Poppler,"  Ca-ca head. Mean, old ca-ca head.
",36,28,2,15,Gilman,Gilman6269,Gilman,"  Sir, I'm making a point. If these gutter-mouthed creatures are so smart, why don't they defend themselves, huh?
",114,28,2,15,Poppler,Leela6270,Leela,"  Stop it!
",11,28,2,15,Gilman,Waterfall Jr.6271,Waterfall Jr.,"  I call murder on that.
",25,28,2,15,Leela,Gilman6272,Gilman,"  Look, I'm willing to grant that it's murder. The real issue is: Who's gonna stop me?
",87,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Linda6273,Linda,"  We seem to be experiencing technical difficulties.  And, crap like I've never seen!
",86,28,2,15,Gilman,Lrrr6274,Lrrr,"  People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.  Turn down that TV, Nd-Nd.
",88,28,2,15,Linda,Farnsworth6275,Farnsworth," Dear Lord, they're back!
",26,28,2,15,Lrrr,Amy6276,Amy," We're doomed!
",15,28,2,15,Farnsworth,Hermes6277,Hermes," Doooomed!
",11,28,2,15,Amy,Bender6278,Bender," Doooo...
",10,28,2,15,Hermes,Lrrr6279,Lrrr,"  Now then, the creatures you call ""Popplers"" come from a nursery planet in our sector.
",88,28,2,15,Bender,Ndnd6280,Ndnd,"  You monsters have been eating our babies!
",44,28,2,15,Lrrr,Leela6281,Leela," Eck!
",6,28,2,15,Ndnd,Ndnd6282,Ndnd,"  We demand justice. As you ate our children, so shall you be eaten by us!
",75,28,2,15,Leela,Lrrr6283,Lrrr,"  We will begin with the firemen, then the math teachers, and so on in that fashion until everyone is eaten.  Transmission over!  Well, that went OK. I tell you, when-when you know you can't scratch, that's when you really have to, huh?  Oh! Oh, yeah, that feels a lot better. What? It's still on?
",298,28,2,15,Ndnd,Zapp6284,Zapp," As chief negotiator, I speak for all of Earth when I mourn the regrettable loss of the Omicronian young. We share your pain.  Mmm.  If we could undo the damage--  These would be great with quack-a-mole.
",204,28,2,15,Lrrr,Lrrr6285,Lrrr,"  Stop eating our young! And it's pronounced guacamole!
",56,28,2,15,Zapp,Zapp6286,Zapp," Alright, I'm putting them away.  Now, uh, what is it you want?
",64,28,2,15,Lrrr,Lrrr6287,Lrrr," We demand--  We demand to eat one human for each Omicronian that was eaten.
",77,28,2,15,Zapp,Zapp6288,Zapp," Fair enough. How many is that?
",32,28,2,15,Lrrr,Kif6289,Kif," 198 billion, sir.
",19,28,2,15,Zapp,Lrrr6290,Lrrr," Very well. You will provide us with 198 billion humans. And, uh, small fries.
",79,28,2,15,Kif,Ndnd6291,Ndnd," Lrrr!
",7,28,2,15,Lrrr,Lrrr6292,Lrrr," Oh, alright, cottage cheese!
",30,28,2,15,Ndnd,Kif6293,Kif," Sir?  There aren't that many human beings.
",44,28,2,15,Lrrr,Zapp6294,Zapp," A thought occurs: There aren't that many humans.
",50,28,2,15,Kif,Lrrr6295,Lrrr," We're willing to wait a few weeks while you shore up the numbers.
",67,28,2,15,Zapp,Zapp6296,Zapp," Hmm. 198 billion babies in a few weeks. We'll need an army of super-virile men scoring round the clock! I'll do my part. Kif, clear my schedule.
",146,28,2,15,Lrrr,Fry6297,Fry," I wish they'd just wipe out humanity and get it over with. It's the waiting I can't stand.
",92,28,2,15,Zapp,Leela6298,Leela," That's stupid!
",16,28,2,15,Fry,Zapp6299,Zapp," My fellow Earthlings, we have reached an agreement. Using the twin guns of grace and tact, I blasted our worthless enemies with a fair compromise.  They will not eat everyone on Earth.
",186,28,2,15,Leela,Lrrr6300,Lrrr," I filled up on nuts at the negotiation.
",41,28,2,15,Zapp,Zapp6301,Zapp," Instead, they will eat only a single human of their choice.
",61,28,2,15,Lrrr,Lrrr6302,Lrrr," We choose to eat the first Earthling who ate our offspring.  Here is the culprit, as photographed by our nanny-cam satellite.  She must be sacrificed, but the rest of you shall be spared.
",189,28,2,15,Zapp,Linda6303,Linda," Tonight, the world watches in horror as an earthling is eaten alive on network television. This grim scene of unimaginable carnage is brought to you by Fishy Joe's! Try our new Extreme Walrus Juice!  100% fresh-squeezed walrus. Ride the walrus!

",12,28,2,15,Man #1 #6,Bender6308,Bender," I'll miss you, Leela.  I know you're just a carbon-based life form but I'll always think of you as a big pile of titanium.
",124,28,2,15,Lrrr,Fry6309,Fry," What Bender means is, you're really brave, and smart, and beautiful, and a great friend.
",90,28,2,15,Bender,Bender6310,Bender,"  Just like titanium!
",22,28,2,15,Fry,Leela6311,Leela," This is all a big load. I was the one trying to save the Popplers.  You were sucking them down like the fat hog you are and you were stepping on them for fun.  You both should be in here instead of me.
",203,28,2,15,Bender,Bender6312,Bender,"  Someone's acting awfully aluminum.
",37,28,2,15,Leela,Zapp6313,Zapp," Leela, my sweet, I've come to save you. I have a devious plan!
",64,28,2,15,Bender,Leela6314,Leela," Oh, great, Captain Moron has a plan. Why don't you tell it to Wingus and Dingus here?
",87,28,2,15,Zapp,Zapp6315,Zapp," Wingus, Dingus, listen up. We're gonna give the aliens the old switcheroo!
",76,28,2,15,Leela,Fry6316,Fry," You mean--
",12,28,2,15,Zapp,Zapp6317,Zapp," Correct. I found a giant hideous ape that looks exactly like Leela.
",69,28,2,15,Fry,Leela6318,Leela," It doesn't look anything like me. The hair is all wrong.
",58,28,2,15,Zapp,Zapp6319,Zapp," Don't worry. Kif is an expert stylist, as you can plainly see.  Mmm!
",70,28,2,15,Leela,Leela6320,Leela," You know, this might actually work. The Omicronians seem to have trouble telling one person from another.
",107,28,2,15,Zapp,Zapp6321,Zapp," True. At the negotiations, they thought Kif here was the statesman and I was a jabbering mental patient. Isn't that right, Kif?
",129,28,2,15,Leela,Kif6322,Kif," Please, I'm creating.  Voila!
",31,28,2,15,Zapp,Bender6323,Bender," Bingo!
",8,28,2,15,Kif,Fry6324,Fry," That's Leela!
",15,28,2,15,Bender,Zapp6325,Zapp," I'm seeing double!
",20,28,2,15,Fry,Lrrr6326,Lrrr," I grow hungry! Bring on the one called ""Leela"".
",49,28,2,15,Zapp,Waiter6327,Waiter," That comes with salad or soup.
",32,28,2,15,Lrrr,Lrrr6328,Lrrr," Uh, salad.
",12,28,2,15,Waiter,Waiter6329,Waiter," Ranch or vinaigrette?
",23,28,2,15,Lrrr,Lrrr6330,Lrrr," Vinaigrette!
",14,28,2,15,Waiter,Waiter6331,Waiter," Balsamic or raspberry?
",24,28,2,15,Lrrr,Woman #1 #46332,Woman #1 #4,"  What's going on here? It's very strange.

",16,28,2,15,Woman #1 #4,Lrrr6336,Lrrr," Hmm. Yes, this is one. Definitely. I recognise her slumping posture and hairy knuckles.
",89,28,2,15,Woman #1 #5,Ndnd6337,Ndnd,"  Would you like some human with your salt?
",44,28,2,15,Lrrr,Linda6338,Linda," This is it. If the aliens fall for Zapp's ploy, the Earth will be saved. Brought to you by Fishy Joe's. Ride the walrus.

",46,28,2,15,Linda,Lrrr6340,Lrrr," W-What's happening? I'm losing the crowd.
",43,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Waterfall Jr.6341,Waterfall Jr.," It's an orang-utan. One of Mother Earth's most precious creatures.
",68,28,2,15,Lrrr,Zapp6342,Zapp," Why'd you open your bong hole, you smelly hippie? You'd sacrifice a beautiful woman to save a moderately-attractive monkey? You must've smoked some bad granola.
",162,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Lrrr6343,Lrrr," The one called ""Smelly Hippie"" is right. This is a monkey!
",60,28,2,15,Zapp,Ndnd6344,Ndnd," Yes. Definitely.
",18,28,2,15,Lrrr,Lrrr6345,Lrrr," Where is the real female?
",27,28,2,15,Ndnd,Zapp6346,Zapp," I'll never tell.
",18,28,2,15,Lrrr,Lrrr6347,Lrrr," Where is the real female?
",27,28,2,15,Zapp,Zapp6348,Zapp," I'll get her for you.
",23,28,2,15,Lrrr,Zapp6349,Zapp," I realise this may hurt our chances of consummating our relationship again.
",77,28,2,15,Zapp,Leela6350,Leela," Go consummate yourself.
",25,28,2,15,Zapp,Lrrr6351,Lrrr," Stop talking, you're getting cold.
",36,28,2,15,Leela,Leela6352,Leela," Please! I just paid off my car!
",33,28,2,15,Lrrr,Fry6353,Fry," No!
",5,28,2,15,Leela,Bender6354,Bender," I can't look!
",15,28,2,15,Fry,Poppler6355,Poppler," Stop!  People of Earth. I am Jrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8. Could someone lower this thing for me?  Now then, if Leela gets eaten, I get eaten.
",151,28,2,15,Bender,Ndnd6356,Ndnd," Little one, get out of there. I'm going to count to blorx!
",60,28,2,15,Poppler,Jrrr6357,Jrrr," But, elder one--
",18,28,2,15,Ndnd,Ndnd6358,Ndnd," Flingle ... glorg ... glorg and a gloob.
",42,28,2,15,Jrrr,Jrrr6359,Jrrr," Hear me out. There are many good reasons to eat: Hunger, boredom, wanting to be the world's fattest man. But not revenge. Are we no better than they? Besides, Leela's my friend.
",179,28,2,15,Ndnd,Lrrr6360,Lrrr,"  Is this true, Earthling?
",27,28,2,15,Jrrr,Leela6361,Leela,"  Yeah, it is.
",15,28,2,15,Lrrr,Lrrr6362,Lrrr," Leela's garbled words have opened my eyes.
",44,28,2,15,Leela,Waterfall Jr.6363,Waterfall Jr.," OK, that's a start, that's very Earth-friendly. Now everyone join hands. Join hands, please. I'd like to lead you all in some swaying. Come on, pay attention.  I said do it! Yeah...
",183,28,2,15,Lrrr,Lrrr6364,Lrrr," Is he your friend too?
",24,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Jrrr6365,Jrrr," No.
",5,28,2,15,Lrrr,Waterfall Jr.6366,Waterfall Jr.," This is not happening.
",24,28,2,15,Jrrr,Lrrr6367,Lrrr," I think there was something funny in that hippie.
",51,28,2,15,Waterfall Jr.,Leela6368,Leela," Thank you, Jrrr.  I hope you'll always think of me as your mom.
",65,28,2,15,Lrrr,Jrrr6369,Jrrr," When my species grows up, we eat our moms!
",44,28,2,15,Leela,Leela6370,Leela," Whoop!
",8,28,2,15,Jrrr,Lrrr6371,Lrrr," People of Earth-- Oh, that hippie's starting to kick in. we've all learned a valuable lesson today. I realise now that--  Dude! My hand are huge!  They can touch anything but themselves.  Oh, wait.
",199,28,2,15,Leela,Ndnd6372,Ndnd," Let's go.
",11,28,2,15,Lrrr,Lrrr6373,Lrrr,"  Whoa!
",8,28,2,15,Ndnd,Lrrr6374,Lrrr,"  Whoa, I feel like I'm flying!
",32,28,2,15,Lrrr,Farnsworth6375,Farnsworth," A toast to Leela. She showed us it's wrong to eat certain things.

",13,28,2,15,Farnsworth,Bender6377,Bender," Let's get drunk!
",18,28,2,15,Fry,Leela6378,Leela," Aww, thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please.
",43,28,2,15,Bender,Bender6379,Bender," Here you go.
",14,28,2,15,Leela,Fry6380,Fry," Mmm, let me get some of that suckling pig.
",44,28,2,15,Bender,Bender6381,Bender," Who wants dolphin?
",20,28,2,15,Fry,Leela6382,Leela," Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent.
",40,28,2,15,Bender,Bender6383,Bender," Not this one. He blew all his money on instant lottery tickets.
",65,28,2,15,Leela,Fry6384,Fry," OK.
",5,28,2,15,Bender,Leela6385,Leela," Oh, OK.
",9,28,2,15,Fry,Amy6386,Amy," That's different.
",19,28,2,15,Leela,Farnsworth6387,Farnsworth," Good, good.
",13,28,2,15,Amy,Leela6388,Leela," Pass the blowhole.
",20,28,2,15,Farnsworth,Amy6389,Amy," Can I have a fluke?
",21,28,2,15,Leela,Hermes6390,Hermes," Hey, quit hogging the bottle-nose.
",36,28,2,15,Amy,Farnsworth6391,Farnsworth," Toss me the speech centre of the brain!
",41,28,2,15,Hermes,Dial L for Leela6392,Dial L for Leela, Ken Keeler,11,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6393,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I've invented a device that allows you to operate equipment from great distances. I call it ""the fing-longer"".  Observe.  And, here we go.  There!
",169,29,2,16,Dial L for Leela,Fry6394,Fry," Ooh!
",6,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Amy6395,Amy," Wow!
",6,29,2,16,Fry,Zoidberg6396,Zoidberg," Ah!
",5,29,2,16,Amy,Farnsworth6397,Farnsworth," Pretty long, eh?
",18,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Fry6398,Fry," Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?
",64,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6399,Farnsworth," Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If question and it generates a video simulation of what would happen.
",138,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6400,Fry," Does it really work?
",22,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6401,Farnsworth," Of course it works!  It's just not very long.
",47,29,2,16,Fry,Bender6402,Bender," Ooh! Ooh!  I wanna aks it a question!  As a robot living among humans, I've never really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I've always secretly wondered: What if I was 500-feet tall?
",195,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Zoidberg6403,Zoidberg," Let's watch, shall we?
",24,29,2,16,Bender,Bender6404,Bender," My work here is done!

",33,29,2,16,Bender,Bender6408,Bender," Put it there, pal!  I meant your wallet.
",42,29,2,16,Fry,Bender6409,Bender," Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes.  Hey!   Aw, quit it! Come on!
",64,29,2,16,Bender,Fry6410,Fry,"  Stop! The robot's not your enemy! He's just a poor, misunderstood--
",70,29,2,16,Bender,Zapp6411,Zapp," Uh--
",6,29,2,16,Fry,Amy6412,Amy," Well, there goes the neighbourhood.  There goes another neighbourhood.
",72,29,2,16,Zapp,Hermes6413,Hermes," We're jerked! Nothing can stop a monster that big.
",52,29,2,16,Amy,Farnsworth6414,Farnsworth," Nothing except and even equally big monster. This is chance to try out my experimental enlarging ray. But we'll need a guinea pig.
",132,29,2,16,Hermes,Zoidberg6415,Zoidberg," What's this? Two meals in one week?
",37,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6416,Farnsworth," Gotcha!
",9,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Hermes6417,Hermes," Oh, yes!
",10,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Zoidberg6418,Zoidberg," Friends! Help! A guinea pig tricked me!  What?
",48,29,2,16,Hermes,Zoidberg6419,Zoidberg," So, now Zoidberg is big, huh? That's more like it! Who's intimidating who now, big city?  Hello, Mr. Chase Manhattan Bank. Deny my credit card application, will you?  Ah, the famed Apollo Theater. ""Boo"" me off stage on open-mic night, huh? I'll show you!
",256,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Bender6420,Bender," Hey, I called this city! Quit touching my stuff!
",50,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Zoidberg6421,Zoidberg," Tell it to claw.

",6,29,2,16,Bender,Fry6426,Fry," Hey, Bender?
",14,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Bender6427,Bender," Huh?
",6,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6428,Fry," Wanna make Shrinky Dinks?
",27,29,2,16,Bender,Bender6429,Bender," Who put this in here?
",23,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6430,Fry,"  Nooo!   Are you people satisfied? This gentle visitor is dying! And we'll never even know why he came.
",105,29,2,16,Bender,Bender6431,Bender," I'll tell you ... with my final breath.   I came here with a simple dream: A dream of killing all humans. And this is how it must end? Who's the real 7-billion-ton robot monster here? Not I.  Not I.
",200,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6432,Fry," Goodnight, sweet prince.
",26,29,2,16,Bender,Narrator6433,Narrator,"  Interesting stuff. Stay tuned for more Tales of Interest!
",60,29,2,16,Fry,Farnsworth6434,Farnsworth," Well, Leela, care to give the What-If machine a whirl?
",56,29,2,16,Narrator,Leela6435,Leela," Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about.
",56,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Hermes6436,Hermes," Come on, woman! Just pick something.
",38,29,2,16,Leela,Fry6437,Fry," Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this.
",37,29,2,16,Hermes,Bender6438,Bender," Go, man! Go!
",14,29,2,16,Fry,Leela6439,Leela," I can be really impulsive. It just takes me a while.  Alright, Professor! Let's do it. Make that machine show me what would happen if I was a little more impulsive. Just a little.  Not too much.
",196,29,2,16,Bender,Leela6440,Leela," Hey, you guys, look what I bought on a wild impulse: New boots. They're like my old ones but with a crazy green stripe. Woo! Never know what I'm gonna do next!
",161,29,2,16,Leela,Farnsworth6441,Farnsworth," Leela, could you come in here for a moment. I have something important to tell you.
",85,29,2,16,Leela,Farnsworth6442,Farnsworth," I can't live forever and I need an heir. Someone to spend my vast riches and take care of my man-eating anteaters when I'm gone.  The others simply aren't level-headed enough. They're too impulsive. Not like you. Not like old, predictable, dull-as-dishwater Leela.
",266,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Leela6443,Leela," Hello? New boots!
",19,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6444,Farnsworth," That's why I've made you my sole heir. The day I die, you'll be a very wealthy woman. Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy. The day I die. Because you're so unimpulsive.
",166,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6445,Leela," Yah!
",6,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6446,Farnsworth,"  Ooh!  Oh, you've killed me! You've killed me!
",48,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6447,Leela," Oh, God! What have I done?
",28,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6448,Farnsworth," I just told you, you've killed me!
",36,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6449,Leela," OK, just try to be nonchalant.
",32,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Zoidberg6450,Zoidberg," Alright, so you're nonchalant. Quit rubbing our noses in it.
",62,29,2,16,Leela,Hermes6451,Hermes," Sweet giant anteater of Saint Anita! The Professor's been eaten by giant anteaters!
",85,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Zoidberg6452,Zoidberg," What?
",7,29,2,16,Hermes,Hermes6453,Hermes," If y'ask me, it's mighty suspicious! I'm gonna call the police ... right after I flush some things.
",101,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Zoidberg6454,Zoidberg," Police? Bah! Nosy meddlers! It so happens I have mail order degrees in Murderology and Murderonomy.  Zoidberg is afoot!
",121,29,2,16,Hermes,Hermes6455,Hermes," Perhaps the Professor's files can clear things up.  ""Citation for public nudity"", ""Conspiracy to commit public nudity"".  Aha! A new will! Naming ...  ... you as his sole heir.
",177,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Leela6456,Leela," That doesn't prove I killed him.
",34,29,2,16,Hermes,Hermes6457,Hermes," It's a video will. It shows you killing him.
",46,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6458,Leela,"  Hi-yah!
",10,29,2,16,Hermes,Zoidberg6459,Zoidberg," Alright, anteater number one, who are you protecting?  Is it anteater number two?  Don't stick your tongue out at me. I need a name!  What? How do you spell that?
",164,29,2,16,Leela,Hermes6460,Hermes,"  What are you hacking off? Is it my torso? It is! My precious torso!
",70,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Zoidberg6461,Zoidberg,"  Hermes, quiet! I'm deducing things.
",38,29,2,16,Hermes,Bender6462,Bender," Whattya got? Disposal trouble?
",32,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Leela6463,Leela," No! Everything's just--
",25,29,2,16,Bender,Bender6464,Bender," Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?.  And now Hermes is mysteriously missing. Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm?  Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the trash!
",255,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6465,Leela," I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered Hermes?
",77,29,2,16,Bender,Bender6466,Bender," Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as you let Bender wet his beak.
",100,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6467,Leela," You're blackmailing me?
",25,29,2,16,Bender,Bender6468,Bender," ""Blackmail"" is such an ugly word. I prefer ""extortion"". The ""X"" makes it sound cool.  Please, honey, I'm made of metal. Like you're really gonna hurt me with a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?
",208,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6469,Leela," OK, that's it. No more killing! Next time you feel like killing just have a stick of gum.  Now to dispose of the body.
",120,29,2,16,Bender,Amy6470,Amy," Wow! Sporty go-cart, Leela! So hip and sexy. Not like you at all.
",67,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6471,Leela," Do you have any gum?
",22,29,2,16,Amy,Amy6472,Amy," No.
",5,29,2,16,Leela,Zoidberg6473,Zoidberg," Ah, the gang's all here.
",26,29,2,16,Amy,Leela6474,Leela," Who are you?
",14,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Scruffy6475,Scruffy," Scruffy, the janitor.
",23,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6476,Leela," I've never seen you before.
",29,29,2,16,Scruffy,Scruffy6477,Scruffy," I've never seen you before neither.
",37,29,2,16,Leela,Zoidberg6478,Zoidberg," Quiet, please. I've called you all here to the parlour to watch as I gradually solve the crime. One of the people in this room ... is a big murderer!  You see, the killer left one fatal clue: This boot print on the Professor's lab coat.
",238,29,2,16,Scruffy,Leela6479,Leela," Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots.  See?
",47,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Fry6480,Fry," Ew! What smells like boot feet?
",33,29,2,16,Leela,Cubert6481,Cubert," This is preposterous. Obviously, the murderer is--
",52,29,2,16,Fry,Zoidberg6482,Zoidberg," My next clue came at 4.15, when the clock stopped. And another came two hours later at 4.15, when I discovered the murdered body of Amy's dead, deceased corpse.
",162,29,2,16,Cubert,Scruffy6483,Scruffy," Scruffy knows who killed them people. In Scruffy's opinion, it were--
",71,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Zoidberg6484,Zoidberg," So, it's just as I suspected all along. The crime is unsolvable!  A letter from Bender, my good friend.  Dear Dr. Jerkberg, if you're reading this, I'm already dead. The person who killed me was ... was--  My God! It can't be! The murderer, it was--
",251,29,2,16,Scruffy,Fry6485,Fry," I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV.
",60,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Leela6486,Leela," Could you get the lights on your way out?
",43,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6487,Fry," Whatcha eating?
",17,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6488,Leela,"  Lobster. Want some?
",22,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6489,Fry," Sure.  Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious deaths.
",89,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6490,Leela," Really?
",9,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6491,Fry," Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?
",50,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6492,Leela," No.
",5,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6493,Fry," No?
",5,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6494,Leela," No!
",5,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6495,Fry," Then ... then ... it was you!
",31,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6496,Leela,"  I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse. Then I had to kill another. And another.
",107,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6497,Fry," Well, that covers the first three killings.
",45,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6498,Leela," And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive!
",88,29,2,16,Fry,Leela6499,Leela," So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?
",53,29,2,16,Leela,Fry6500,Fry," I like it!
",12,29,2,16,Leela,Leela6501,Leela," Good. Now let me just get the lights.
",39,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6502,Fry," I really like it!
",19,29,2,16,Leela,Farnsworth6503,Farnsworth," Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Fry?
",64,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6504,Fry," Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?
",57,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Leela6505,Leela," You idiot! We already saw that.
",33,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6506,Fry," I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.
",43,29,2,16,Leela,Farnsworth6507,Farnsworth," We're not seeing it again! Ask something less stupid.
",55,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6508,Fry," Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came to the future-jiggy?
",106,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6509,Farnsworth," That question is less stupid, though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way.  What would happen if Fry never came to the future?
",131,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6510,Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!  Here's to another lousy Millennium!  Ow!  I should have left you floating in the toilet!
",143,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Leela6511,Leela," What is it?
",13,29,2,16,Fry,Farnsworth6512,Farnsworth," It appears that the very fabric of space-time has ripped.
",59,29,2,16,Leela,Bender6513,Bender," Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!
",37,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Fry6514,Fry," Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?
",49,29,2,16,Bender,Zoidberg6515,Zoidberg," If that's his pizza, then I'm icy whatever!
",45,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6516,Fry," You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?
",56,29,2,16,Zoidberg,Panucci6517,Panucci," There's only three real monsters, kid: Dracula, Blacula and Son of Kong. Now quit picking your nose and knead that dough!  Hey! The usual, Professor Hawking?
",159,29,2,16,Fry,Stephen Hawking6518,Stephen Hawking," No. Today I'd like something good.
",36,29,2,16,Panucci,Panucci6519,Panucci," Hawking, you're alright! I'll make you the usual!
",51,29,2,16,Stephen Hawking,Fry6520,Fry," Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?
",72,29,2,16,Panucci,Hawking6521,Hawking," Sure. Why not?
",16,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6522,Fry," Let me ask you something: Has anyone ever discovered a hole in nothing with monsters in it?  'Cause if I'm the first, I want them to call it ""a Fry Hole"".
",156,29,2,16,Hawking,Hawking6523,Hawking," There is nothing to be concerned about. I must go. There is much to do.
",73,29,2,16,Fry,Panucci6524,Panucci," Hey, Hawking! Your pizza's ready.
",35,29,2,16,Hawking,Hawking6525,Hawking," Toss it in the garbage!
",25,29,2,16,Panucci,Hawking6526,Hawking,"  There he is. Seize him.
",26,29,2,16,Hawking,Fry6527,Fry,"  Who said that?  Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!
",48,29,2,16,Hawking,Fry6528,Fry," Who are you people?
",21,29,2,16,Fry,Gore6529,Gore," I'm Al Gore, and these are my Vice Presidential Action Rangers; a group of top nerds whose sole duty it is to prevent disruptions in the space-time continuum.
",160,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6530,Fry," I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
",70,29,2,16,Gore,Gore6531,Gore," That, and protect the space-time continuum. Read the Constitution!
",68,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6532,Fry," Hmm. So I guess you'll wanna see my Fry Hole.
",47,29,2,16,Gore,Gore6533,Gore," Very much so. But first, meet the Action Rangers. You already know Stephen Hawking. Also with us are Nichelle Nichols, a.k.a. Commander Uhura.
",144,29,2,16,Fry,Nichols6534,Nichols," Incoming transmission from MCI ""One Rate"" department. It sounds like a limited-time offer.
",92,29,2,16,Gore,Gore6535,Gore," Tell them I'm in the tub! To my left you'll recognise Gary Gygax, inventor of Dungeons & Dragons.
",99,29,2,16,Nichols,Gygax6536,Gygax," Greetings! It's a ...  ... pleasure to meet you!
",50,29,2,16,Gore,Gore6537,Gore," And our summer intern, Deep Blue, the world's foremost chess-playing computer.
",80,29,2,16,Gygax,Deep Blue6538,Deep Blue," Bishop to knight 4.
",21,29,2,16,Gore,Gore6539,Gore," Not all missions can be solved with chess, Deep Blue. Someday you'll understand that.
",87,29,2,16,Deep Blue,Fry6540,Fry," Where am I, anyway?
",21,29,2,16,Gore,Nichols6541,Nichols," You're travelling in a specially-equipped terrestrial transport module.
",73,29,2,16,Fry,Gygax6542,Gygax," A school bus!
",15,29,2,16,Nichols,Fry6543,Fry," So what do you nerds want?
",28,29,2,16,Gygax,Nichols6544,Nichols," It's about that rip in space-time that you saw.
",49,29,2,16,Fry,Hawking6545,Hawking," I call it a ""Hawking Hole"".
",29,29,2,16,Nichols,Fry6546,Fry," No fair! I saw it first!
",26,29,2,16,Hawking,Hawking6547,Hawking," Who is The Journal of Quantum Physics going to believe?
",57,29,2,16,Fry,Gygax6548,Gygax," Mr. Fry, the time disruption indicates that some of that was supposed to happen but didn't, due to a quantum fluctuation.
",123,29,2,16,Hawking,Nichols6549,Nichols," That's why we had to beat you with tennis rackets.
",52,29,2,16,Gygax,Gore6550,Gore," If we don't go back there and make the event happen, the entire universe will be destroyed! And as an environmentalist, I'm against that.
",139,29,2,16,Nichols,Fry6551,Fry," So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.
",74,29,2,16,Gore,Hawking6552,Hawking," I call it a ""Hawking Chamber"".
",32,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6553,Fry," But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head.
",76,29,2,16,Hawking,Gore6554,Gore," Well it's obvious what should have happened: That wang to the head should have killed you.
",92,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6555,Fry," Uh, what?
",11,29,2,16,Gore,Nichols6556,Nichols," Let's finish the job.
",23,29,2,16,Fry,Gore6557,Gore," No! Wait! There must be a peaceful--
",38,29,2,16,Nichols,Hawking6558,Hawking," Hold him down.
",16,29,2,16,Gore,Deep Blue6559,Deep Blue," Check.
",8,29,2,16,Hawking,Fry6560,Fry," Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
",17,29,2,16,Deep Blue,Nichols6561,Nichols," Something's wrong. Murder isn't working and that's all we're good at.
",71,29,2,16,Fry,Gygax6562,Gygax," Let's try something else. Maybe we should--
",45,29,2,16,Nichols,Gore6563,Gore," Put the dice away before I take them away.
",44,29,2,16,Gygax,Nichols6564,Nichols," Wait. I'm getting an idea. What if Fry was supposed to get frozen?
",68,29,2,16,Gore,Hawking6565,Hawking," Yes. Shove him in the tube. It was my idea.
",45,29,2,16,Nichols,Bender6566,Bender," Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!
",58,29,2,16,Hawking,Gore6567,Gore," Get in the tube, dummy! We only have a few seconds before the universe is destroyed.
",86,29,2,16,Bender,Fry6568,Fry," Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up.
",74,29,2,16,Gore,Gygax6569,Gygax," Here. Take my plus-one mace.
",30,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6570,Fry," OK, here I go.
",16,29,2,16,Gygax,Gore6571,Gore," You fool! You foolish fool!
",29,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6572,Fry," Eh, what's the worst thing that can happen?
",45,29,2,16,Gore,Hawking6573,Hawking," Great. The entire universe was destroyed.
",43,29,2,16,Fry,Fry6574,Fry," Destroyed? Then where are we now?
",35,29,2,16,Hawking,Gore6575,Gore," I don't know. But I can darn well tell you where we're not: The universe.
",75,29,2,16,Fry,Nichols6576,Nichols," Eternity with nerds. It's the Pasadena Star Trek convention all over again.
",77,29,2,16,Gore,Gygax6577,Gygax," Anyone wanna play Dungeons & Dragons for the next quadrillion years?
",70,29,2,16,Nichols,Fry6578,Fry," Sure.
",7,29,2,16,Gygax,Hawking6579,Hawking," I guess.
",10,29,2,16,Fry,Deep Blue6580,Deep Blue," Pawn to rook 8.
",17,29,2,16,Hawking,Gore6581,Gore," I'm a 10th-level Vice President!
",34,29,2,16,Deep Blue,Farnsworth6582,Farnsworth," That story was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria! This thing isn't worth the gold it's made of.  Anyway, the fing-longer seems to be arousing success.
",162,29,2,16,Gore,Fry6583,Fry," Good work.
",12,29,2,16,Farnsworth,Leela6584,Leela," Congratulations!
",18,29,2,16,Fry,Amy6585,Amy," Right on, Professor!
",22,29,2,16,Leela,Farnsworth6586,Farnsworth," So that's what things would be like if I'd invented the fing-longer.  A man can dream though. A man can dream.
",112,29,2,16,Amy,Fry6587,Fry," Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum ... ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with the breath-freshening power of ham.
",108,30,2,17,Farnsworth,Bender6588,Bender," And it pinkens your teeth while you chew.
",43,30,2,17,Fry,Clerk6589,Clerk," Alright, sergeant, $100 worth of pixie stix and porno mags with your 5% military discount comes to $95.  That'll be 40 cents.
",127,30,2,17,Bender,Fry6590,Fry," I believe you're forgetting about our 5% military discount.
",61,30,2,17,Clerk,Clerk6591,Clerk," Well that's only for people in the military.
",46,30,2,17,Fry,Bender6592,Bender," What? This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!
",70,30,2,17,Clerk,Clerk6593,Clerk," Alright, look. Our policy is: If for any reason you're not completely satisfied, I hate you.
",94,30,2,17,Bender,Bender6594,Bender," OK, now I'm mad!
",18,30,2,17,Clerk,Fry6595,Fry," Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, monsignor.
",53,30,2,17,Bender,Bender6596,Bender," Hello. We're here because we, uh, love our planet!
",52,30,2,17,Fry,Recruitment Officer6597,Recruitment Officer," Sign here on the dotted line, patriots, and I'll give you your discount cards.
",80,30,2,17,Bender,Fry6598,Fry," Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately quit the army, right?
",98,30,2,17,Recruitment Officer,Bender6599,Bender," You know, playing you all for chumps?
",39,30,2,17,Fry,Recruitment Officer6600,Recruitment Officer," Correct. There's no obligation.  Unless, of course, war were declared.
",72,30,2,17,Bender,Fry6601,Fry," What's that?
",14,30,2,17,Recruitment Officer,Recruitment Officer6602,Recruitment Officer," War were declared.
",20,30,2,17,Fry,Farnsworth6603,Farnsworth," Now be careful, Fry. And if you kill anyone, make sure to eat their heart, to gain their courage. Their rich, tasty courage.
",126,30,2,17,Recruitment Officer,Hermes6604,Hermes," I don't want you to worry about your jobs while you're away. That's why I'm firing you now.
",93,30,2,17,Farnsworth,Leela6605,Leela," I wanna enlist. My friends always die if I'm not there to save them.
",70,30,2,17,Hermes,Zapp6606,Zapp," Sorry, but the army's instituted a men-only policy.
",53,30,2,17,Leela,Leela6607,Leela," What?
",7,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6608,Zapp," It's shameful, I agree. In the olden days, I proudly fought alongside female troops, shoulder to, uh, shoulder. Alas, after a series of deadly blunders caused by distracting low-cut fatigues and lots of harmless pinching, the army decided women weren't fit for service. Not when I'm in charge.
",295,30,2,17,Leela,Leela6609,Leela," You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson.
",54,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6610,Zapp," If it's a lesson in love, watch out; I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. What do I call it, Kif?
",109,30,2,17,Leela,Kif6611,Kif," ""Sex-lexia"".
",14,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6612,Zapp," Men, you're lucky men. Soon you'll all be fighting for your planet. Many of you will be dying for your planet. A few of you will be forced through a fine mesh screen for your planet. They will be the luckiest of all.
",218,30,2,17,Kif,Bender6613,Bender," Great, we're gonna die.
",25,30,2,17,Zapp,Fry6614,Fry," And this ham gum is all bones.
",32,30,2,17,Bender,Zapp6615,Zapp," Now to present the logistics of our mission, the Commander-in-Chief. Please welcome the original Gerber Baby, Earth President Richard M. Nixon.
",145,30,2,17,Fry,Nixon6616,Nixon," This is the brass ring, fellas.  Planet Spheron One!
",54,30,2,17,Zapp,Fry6617,Fry," Cool effect!
",14,30,2,17,Nixon,Zapp6618,Zapp," It's a desolate, ugly little planet with absolutely no natural resources or strategic value. Questions?
",105,30,2,17,Fry,Soldier #1 #16619,Soldier #1 #1," Why is this Godforsaken planet worth dying for?
",49,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6620,Zapp," Don't ask me, you're the one who's going to be dying.
",55,30,2,17,Soldier #1 #1,Fry6621,Fry," Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?
",42,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6622,Zapp," A valid question.  We know nothing about their language, their history or what they look like. But we can assume this: They stand for everything we don't stand for. Also, they told me you guys look like dorks.
",211,30,2,17,Fry,Bender6623,Bender," They look like dorks!
",23,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6624,Zapp," What's the matter, private? Tent got your tongue?  Tent got your...  Kif, write that down and send it to ""Humor In Uniform"".
",126,30,2,17,Bender,Fry6625,Fry," Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales!
",80,30,2,17,Zapp,Kif6626,Kif," That new recruit is phenomenal, sir.
",38,30,2,17,Fry,Zapp6627,Zapp," Yes. He edged out my old mark by two seconds ...  ... and 16 minutes ... and 12 hours. I do plan to finish someday, Kif. Good hustle, soldier.
",144,30,2,17,Kif,Leela6628,Leela,"  Uh, sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode. You know how testosterone is.
",76,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6629,Zapp," As a bubbling Crock-Pot of male hormones, I sure do. What's your name, private?
",81,30,2,17,Leela,Leela6630,Leela,"  Lee--  La ... man. La Man ... Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir.
",55,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6631,Zapp," Lemon, you're a man's man. You're a man's man's man. More importantly, your hand, while firm and masculine, is soft as a velvet child. What lotion do you use?
",160,30,2,17,Leela,Leela6632,Leela,"  Pert and Popular, sir.
",25,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6633,Zapp," Roger that. Kif, get me ten cases of Pert and Popular.
",56,30,2,17,Leela,Kif6634,Kif," What shall I do with your Jergens, sir?
",41,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6635,Zapp," Squirt it on some homeless man with dry elbows.  Private Lee Lemon may well be the finest recruit I've seen in all my years of service. That young man fills me with hope and some other emotions that are weird and deeply confusing to me.
",238,30,2,17,Kif,Kif6636,Kif," Ew!
",5,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6637,Zapp,"  Hello!
",9,30,2,17,Kif,Nixon6638,Nixon," Mmm! Now that's a nice rosÃ©. So, anyway, we open up the panda crate and, wouldn't you know it, the damn thing's dead! Up-chucked it's bamboo. True story.
",155,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6639,Zapp," Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's whatever you were talking about for you.
",65,30,2,17,Nixon,Fry6640,Fry," Mind if we sit with you?
",26,30,2,17,Zapp,Leela6641,Leela,"  Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys.
",81,30,2,17,Fry,Fry6642,Fry," Good point ... I guess.
",25,30,2,17,Leela,Bender6643,Bender," You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle.
",101,30,2,17,Fry,Hick6644,Hick," So. Any you fellas got a special lady back home?
",50,30,2,17,Bender,Fry6645,Fry," Well, I sort of a have a thing for this girl I work with.
",59,30,2,17,Hick,Leela6646,Leela," Really?  What type is she? You know, blonde, or Chinese, or Cyclops?
",70,30,2,17,Fry,Fry6647,Fry," Cyclops.
",10,30,2,17,Leela,Leela6648,Leela,"  Aww, she sounds sweet.
",25,30,2,17,Fry,Bender6649,Bender," But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, ugly son of a--
",92,30,2,17,Leela,Leela6650,Leela,"  Stop! Stop flattering me!
",28,30,2,17,Bender,Zapp6651,Zapp,"  Ten hut!  Well, well, well. If it isn't Lee Lemon: The flaming star of Brannigan's Rough Rangers. Say, uh, Lemon, do you like to read? I just got a great book on tape. It's about life in Ancient Greece and--
",210,30,2,17,Leela,Leela6652,Leela,"  Sir, the alarm. I think I'd better--
",39,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6653,Zapp," Shh. Don't talk. Just go.
",27,30,2,17,Leela,Nixon6654,Nixon," We are now in position above Spheron One. This is the moment we were training for all yesterday afternoon.
",108,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6655,Zapp," And now for the battle plan: As you all know, the key to victory is the element of surprise. Surprise!
",104,30,2,17,Nixon,Fry6656,Fry," It's creepy here.
",19,30,2,17,Zapp,Soldier #1 #16657,Soldier #1 #1," This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
",53,30,2,17,Fry,Fry6658,Fry," And then the battle's not so bad?
",35,30,2,17,Soldier #1 #1,Soldier #1 #16659,Soldier #1 #1," Oh, right. I forgot about the battle.
",39,30,2,17,Fry,Fry6660,Fry," What's happening?
",19,30,2,17,Soldier #1 #1,Hick6661,Hick," Holy shoot! Lookie!
",21,30,2,17,Fry,Fry6662,Fry," The enemy! They're balls!
",27,30,2,17,Hick,Leela6663,Leela," Charge your gun, Fry.
",23,30,2,17,Fry,Fry6664,Fry," Oh, right.
",12,30,2,17,Leela,Zapp6665,Zapp," Watch where you're shooting, private! You spooked Felicity.  There, there, boy.
",81,30,2,17,Fry,Soldier #1 #16666,Soldier #1 #1,"  Give this to my son.
",23,30,2,17,Zapp,Bender6667,Bender," You got it!
",13,30,2,17,Soldier #1 #1,Soldier #1 #16668,Soldier #1 #1,"  Wait. I didn't tell you where he lives.
",42,30,2,17,Bender,Bender6669,Bender," Hey, I think your son might also like those boots.
",52,30,2,17,Soldier #1 #1,Hick6670,Hick," Cover us, buddy. You've got the only wounded-up positron shooter.  Fry, you emu-bellied coward!
",97,30,2,17,Bender,Fry6671,Fry,"  Bender! No!
",14,30,2,17,Hick,Bender6672,Bender," If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender.
",63,30,2,17,Fry,P.A. Announcer #16673,P.A. Announcer #1,"  Incoming wounded. All operating personnel report to tent four, repeat, four-- I mean five! Repeat, four.
",107,30,2,17,Bender,Nurse6674,Nurse," Are you ready to operate, doctor?
",35,30,2,17,P.A. Announcer #1,Zoidberg6675,Zoidberg,"  I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery.  I kid! I kid!
",67,30,2,17,Nurse,Zoidberg6676,Zoidberg," Scalpel.  Blood bucket.  Priest. Next patient.
",48,30,2,17,Zoidberg,iHawk6677,iHawk," Gee, Zoidberg, leave some for the enemy to kill.
",50,30,2,17,Zoidberg,Nurse6678,Nurse," Leave Dr. Zoidberg alone! He has twice the training you do.
",61,30,2,17,iHawk,iHawk6679,iHawk," Yeah, he's a doctor and a butcher!
",36,30,2,17,Nurse,Zoidberg6680,Zoidberg," See, this is how it starts. First with he jokes, then comes the heavy stuff.
",78,30,2,17,iHawk,iHawk6681,iHawk," When will the killing end?
",28,30,2,17,Zoidberg,Zapp6682,Zapp," Look at this sissy, Kif. While others were fighting and dying pointlessly, he was hiding in a hole, wallowing in a pool of his own cowardice.
",143,30,2,17,iHawk,Fry6683,Fry," That wasn't cowardice.
",24,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6684,Zapp," I'm de-promoting you, soldier. Kif, what's the most humiliating job there is?
",79,30,2,17,Fry,Kif6685,Kif," Being your assistant.
",23,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6686,Zapp," Wrong! Being your assistant! Private Fry, you shall henceforth serve as Kif's assistant.
",90,30,2,17,Kif,Fry6687,Fry," That doesn't sound too bad.
",29,30,2,17,Zapp,Kif6688,Kif," You speak when I tell you to, you filthy worm!
",48,30,2,17,Fry,Zoidberg6689,Zoidberg," I'm afraid he's gone.
",23,30,2,17,Kif,Hick6690,Hick," Whoa, doc, I ain't dead.
",26,30,2,17,Zoidberg,Zoidberg6691,Zoidberg," Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor.
",38,30,2,17,Hick,iHawk6692,iHawk," Believe it all you want, that won't make it true.  This isn't a war, it's a murder.  This isn't a war, it's a moider!
",119,30,2,17,Zoidberg,Hick6693,Hick," Bender, old buddy, hang in there.
",35,30,2,17,iHawk,Zapp6694,Zapp," Here lies the bravest soldier I've seen since my mirror got grease on it. I hereby order that in Bender's honour he be melted down and made into a statue of himself.
",167,30,2,17,Hick,Nixon6695,Nixon," Slow down there, Starsky, I'm up to something here. I want this robot fixed. Fixed like Kennedy fixed the 1960 election. Damn bean-eating war hero!
",149,30,2,17,Zapp,Nurse6696,Nurse," Are you read to operate, doctor?
",34,30,2,17,Nixon,iHawk6697,iHawk," I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery.
",51,30,2,17,Nurse,Zoidberg6698,Zoidberg," That's my joke! I'll kill you!
",32,30,2,17,iHawk,Zapp6699,Zapp," Ah! Pre-war scotch!  Welcome, Lieutenant Bender. You're looking sharp.
",72,30,2,17,Zoidberg,Bender6700,Bender," I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers.
",40,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6701,Zapp," Damnit, Kif, where's the little umbrella? That's what makes it a scotch-on-the-rocks!
",87,30,2,17,Bender,Kif6702,Kif," Actually, sir--
",17,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6703,Zapp," Make me a new one.
",20,30,2,17,Kif,Kif6704,Kif," Use a brush, you dunderhead! And mix these mixed nuts. I see two almonds touching!
",84,30,2,17,Zapp,Nixon6705,Nixon," Now, listen here, Bender. This war is in danger of going all quagmire on me, so I'm sending you on one last mission.
",118,30,2,17,Kif,Bender6706,Bender," Hot diggidy daffodil!
",23,30,2,17,Nixon,Nixon6707,Nixon," A mission of peace.
",21,30,2,17,Bender,Bender6708,Bender,"  Oh!
",6,30,2,17,Nixon,Zapp6709,Zapp," You'll be negotiating with the aliens' mysterious leaders, the Brain Balls. They've got a lot of brains and they've got a lot of kutzpa!
",138,30,2,17,Bender,Nixon6710,Nixon," Accompanying you will be our top peace negotiator, Henry Kissenger.
",69,30,2,17,Zapp,Kissenger6711,Kissenger," How are you?
",14,30,2,17,Nixon,Bender6712,Bender," Is he any good?
",17,30,2,17,Kissenger,Nixon6713,Nixon," Looking like that, he talked his way into Jill St. John's bed. Nuff said!
",75,30,2,17,Bender,Nixon6714,Nixon,"  I'm so dizzy,
My head is spinning,
Like a whirlpool,
It never ends.
",70,30,2,17,Nixon,Zapp6715,Zapp," A little lower. Lower. Lower. A lot lower. Too low! ... Lower!
",64,30,2,17,Nixon,Fry6716,Fry,"  I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh.
",36,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6717,Zapp," Private Lemon, no need to leave.   My stall just became free.
",63,30,2,17,Fry,Leela6718,Leela,"  Maybe you should put on a towel, sir.
",40,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6719,Zapp," Right! Right!  I'm about to try the new lotion you recommended.  If I should accidentally put too much on my hands, perhaps I could rub it onto you.
",150,30,2,17,Leela,Nixon6720,Nixon," Brannigan!
",12,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6721,Zapp," Hm?
",5,30,2,17,Nixon,Nixon6722,Nixon," My God, cover yourself. I didn't live a thousand years and travel a quadrillion miles to look at another man's gizmo.
",119,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6723,Zapp," Uh, sorry, Mr. President, I-I didn't realise. Kif, raise him up about nipple-high.
",84,30,2,17,Nixon,Nixon6724,Nixon," Come on, Brannigan, stuff yourself into a uniform. We've gotta get off this planet before the bomb goes off.
",110,30,2,17,Zapp,Leela6725,Leela,"  Bomb? What bomb?
",19,30,2,17,Nixon,Zapp6726,Zapp," The one we had the doctors implant in that gullible Bender robot.
",67,30,2,17,Leela,Nixon6727,Nixon," Zapp. Zapp!
",13,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6728,Zapp," Hm?
",5,30,2,17,Nixon,Nixon6729,Nixon," Inspect the troops later. It's time to activate the bomb.
",59,30,2,17,Zapp,Kissenger6730,Kissenger," Now, as for economic co-operation--
",37,30,2,17,Nixon,Bender6731,Bender," Whoa! Scuse me.
",17,30,2,17,Kissenger,P.A. Announcer #16732,P.A. Announcer #1,"  Attention: All personnel evacuate the planet immediately. And not just because it's meat loaf night.
",103,30,2,17,Bender,Zapp6733,Zapp," Come along, Lemon, before this whole dump blows up.
",53,30,2,17,P.A. Announcer #1,Leela6734,Leela,"  Uh, Commander? Could you tell me when the bomb is exploding?
",63,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6735,Zapp," Of course, my significant soldier. The bomb is voice-activated. It will detonate the instant the robot unwittingly speaks a certain word.
",139,30,2,17,Leela,Fry6736,Fry," What's the word, uh, sir?
",27,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6737,Zapp," It's the one word the robot uses more than any other. We got it from this convenient database of his 10 most frequently-used words.  Number 10, chump; number nine, chumpette; number eight, yours; number seven, up; number six, pimpmobile; number five, bite; number four, my ...  ... number three, shiny; number two, daffodil. And Bender's number one most frequently-uttered word, the word which, if uttered, will blow up this entire planet: Ass.
",446,30,2,17,Fry,Fry6738,Fry," We don't have long!
",21,30,2,17,Zapp,Brain Ball #16739,Brain Ball #1," We demand bouncing, followed by rolling, followed by rolling of the third type.
",81,30,2,17,Fry,Kissenger6740,Kissenger," Say what?
",11,30,2,17,Brain Ball #1,Bender6741,Bender," My chair's too hard. It's a real pain in the, uh, whattya call it? Lower back! Yeah, that whole region.
",105,30,2,17,Kissenger,Fry6742,Fry," OK, I gotta break down that gate, beat up those three guards, steal that chopper and rescue Bender.
",101,30,2,17,Bender,Leela6743,Leela," Hi-yah!
",9,30,2,17,Fry,Fry6744,Fry," Hey, I did it! Wait, that's not me.
",37,30,2,17,Leela,Leela6745,Leela,"  Come on! We gotta save Bender.
",33,30,2,17,Fry,Fry6746,Fry," You wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely know him.
",53,30,2,17,Leela,Leela6747,Leela," Fry, don't you recognise me?
",30,30,2,17,Fry,Fry6748,Fry,"  Hermes?
",10,30,2,17,Leela,Zapp6749,Zapp," Lee? When will I see you again?  The two of you are good friends? But I thought we would be good friends.  Well, let's see how friendly you get when you're sharing a prison cell!
",180,30,2,17,Fry,Leela6750,Leela," Hey, Zapp!
",12,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6751,Zapp," Leela!
",8,30,2,17,Leela,Fry6752,Fry," Leela!
",8,30,2,17,Zapp,Zapp6753,Zapp," So it's you I've been attracted to! Oh, God, I've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman.
",99,30,2,17,Fry,Leela6754,Leela," Let's do it again sometime.
",29,30,2,17,Zapp,Brain Ball #26755,Brain Ball #2," The Elders tell of a young ball much like you. He bounced three metres in the air. Then he bounced 1.8 metres in the air. Then he bounced four metres in the air. Do I make myself clear?
",187,30,2,17,Leela,Kissenger6756,Kissenger," Mr. Ambassador, our people tell the same story. Oy.
",53,30,2,17,Brain Ball #2,Bender6757,Bender," These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their-- Wait a second. Where do you shove things up a ball?
",175,30,2,17,Kissenger,Kissenger6758,Kissenger," This isn't a productive area of discussion.
",45,30,2,17,Bender,Leela6759,Leela," We're here. I followed the bouncing balls.  I'll keep the chopper at a safe altitude while you parachute down.
",112,30,2,17,Kissenger,Fry6760,Fry," OK, my best friend's life is at stake. I can finally prove that I'm not a coward.  Will you push me?
",102,30,2,17,Leela,Leela6761,Leela,"  I already did!
",17,30,2,17,Fry,Fry6762,Fry,"  Thank you!  At last, war has made me into a man.
",51,30,2,17,Leela,Kissenger6763,Kissenger," Please, gentlemen, we must put an end to the bloodshed. We have all seen too many body bags and ball sacks.
",109,30,2,17,Fry,Brain Ball #16764,Brain Ball #1," We cannot condone bouncing of the seventh variety.
",52,30,2,17,Kissenger,Bender6765,Bender," Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But before I go I have one thing to say.  Bite my shiny metal--
",131,30,2,17,Brain Ball #1,Fry6766,Fry," Stop! You can't say the next word.
",36,30,2,17,Bender,Bender6767,Bender," Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch.
",52,30,2,17,Fry,Fry6768,Fry," Bender, if you say the A-word, you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word!
",80,30,2,17,Bender,Kissenger6769,Kissenger," Young man, you have the bravery of a hero and breath as fresh as a summer ham.  What? What is funny?
",102,30,2,17,Fry,Bender6770,Bender," Bender's got the upper hand now.  The name of the game is ""Make Bender Happy Or He Blows Up The Planet"".  I'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!
",226,30,2,17,Kissenger,Brain Ball #16771,Brain Ball #1," Please, stay calm. There's no need to bounce of the handle.
",61,30,2,17,Bender,Bender6772,Bender," That's it, I'm saying it! ""A"" is for--
",40,30,2,17,Brain Ball #1,Brain Ball #16773,Brain Ball #1," Wait, stop! We give in to all of Earth's demands. The war is over. Our home planet is yours.
",94,30,2,17,Bender,Fry6774,Fry," Alright! Hey, wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading aliens?
",89,30,2,17,Brain Ball #1,Brain Ball #26775,Brain Ball #2," Correct.
",10,30,2,17,Fry,Bender6776,Bender," Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson: Don't mess with Earth.
",68,30,2,17,Brain Ball #2,Brain Ball #16777,Brain Ball #1," May you bounce in peace.
",26,30,2,17,Bender,Bender6778,Bender," Get the hell off my planet.
",29,30,2,17,Brain Ball #1,Farnsworth6779,Farnsworth," Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him.  Wake up!
",50,30,2,17,Bender,Bender6780,Bender," Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying the word I love to say?
",103,30,2,17,Farnsworth,Zoidberg6781,Zoidberg," I'm sorry but we couldn't remove it.
",38,30,2,17,Bender,Farnsworth6782,Farnsworth," It's stuck in there with glue or something, I don't know.
",59,30,2,17,Zoidberg,Bender6783,Bender,"  Well, this is just great! What's the point of living if I can't say ""ass""?  Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!
",159,30,2,17,Farnsworth,Leela6784,Leela," We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it.
",68,30,2,17,Bender,Amy6785,Amy," It's from the list of words you almost never say.
",51,30,2,17,Leela,Bender6786,Bender," That's using your ass. So, what's the word?
",45,30,2,17,Amy,Hermes6787,Hermes," We think it's better if you don't know.
",41,30,2,17,Bender,Bender6788,Bender," Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Ooh, is it ""please""?
",65,30,2,17,Hermes,Fry6789,Fry," No.
",5,30,2,17,Bender,Bender6790,Bender," Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! ""Thanks""!
",46,30,2,17,Fry,Leela6791,Leela," Bender, stop trying to destroy the world.
",43,30,2,17,Bender,Bender6792,Bender," Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it ""sorry""? No. ""Fun-derful""? Uh, ""non-alcoholic""?
",79,30,2,17,Leela,Amy6793,Amy," Quit it!
",10,30,2,17,Bender,Fry6794,Fry," Bender!
",9,30,2,17,Amy,Hermes6795,Hermes," Stop it, mon!
",15,30,2,17,Fry,Zoidberg6796,Zoidberg," Enough already!
",17,30,2,17,Hermes,Bender6797,Bender,"  ""Compassion""? ""Shrimptoast""? ""Antiquing""?  I'm alright!
",58,30,2,17,Zoidberg,Doctorbot6798,Doctorbot," Notify his survivors.
",23,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6799,Bender,"  B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender!  B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! Sayin' B-E-N-D-ER--
",69,31,2,18,Doctorbot,Hermes6800,Hermes," Mail call! Amy, here's your designer lingerie catalogue. Fry, Sadie's Bra Parade and, Leela, Bulk Underpants Outlet.
",118,31,2,18,Bender,Leela6801,Leela," You buy one pound of underwear and you're on their list forever.
",66,31,2,18,Hermes,Hermes6802,Hermes," And for Bender-- Uh-oh! A black-bordered envelope.
",52,31,2,18,Leela,Amy6803,Amy," Oh, no! Someone you know must've died.
",40,31,2,18,Hermes,Bender6804,Bender," I hope it was one of my enemies; those guys suck!  Oh, no! My uncle Vladimir.
",79,31,2,18,Amy,Fry6805,Fry," Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?
",44,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6806,Bender," Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will.  Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always hated!  C'mon, it'll be fun!
",150,31,2,18,Fry,Bender6807,Bender," Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton. Could you take us to yon castle?
",68,31,2,18,Bender,Robot #1 #16808,Robot #1 #1," Some say unholy things happen up there.
",41,31,2,18,Bender,Robot #1 #26809,Robot #1 #2," For example: All of us say that.
",34,31,2,18,Robot #1 #1,Farnsworth6810,Farnsworth," Fuf! Superstitious robot mumbo-jumbo.
",39,31,2,18,Robot #1 #2,Robot #1 #26811,Robot #1 #2," Mumbo, perhaps. Jumbo, perhaps not! With all your modern science are you any closer to understanding the mystery of how a robot walks or talks?
",145,31,2,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6812,Farnsworth," Yes, you idiot.  The circuit diagram is right here on the inside of your case.
",80,31,2,18,Robot #1 #2,Robot #1 #26813,Robot #1 #2," I choose to believe what I was programmed to believe.
",55,31,2,18,Farnsworth,Robot #1 #26814,Robot #1 #2," I will go this far and no further.
",36,31,2,18,Robot #1 #2,Preacherbot6815,Preacherbot," I now commend Vladimir's remains to the earth. Filings to filings; rust to rust.
",82,31,2,18,Robot #1 #2,Execu-Tor6816,Execu-Tor,"  To my loyal butler, You There, for his decades of service, I leave a pittance, to be paid in 20 equal instalments of one-twentieth of a pittance each.  To my lazy, spoiled son, Tandy, who never learned the value of a dollar, I leave my entire $10 million fortune.
",266,31,2,18,Preacherbot,Tandy6817,Tandy,"  Is that a lot?
",17,31,2,18,Execu-Tor,Execu-Tor6818,Execu-Tor,"  And to my loving nephew, Bender, assuming he's not responsible for my death, I leave my castle.
",98,31,2,18,Tandy,Bender6819,Bender," Yes! Let's stay there tonight.
",32,31,2,18,Execu-Tor,Execu-Tor6820,Execu-Tor,"  On condition that he spend one night within its walls.
",57,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6821,Bender," Oh, man, there's always a catch!
",34,31,2,18,Execu-Tor,Bender6822,Bender," Ah! I got a good vibe from this place: Nice long dinner table, quiet, well-behaved spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It's gonna be--
",134,31,2,18,Bender,Leela6823,Leela," What is it?
",13,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6824,Bender," That painting, the eyes are watching me!
",42,31,2,18,Leela,Farnsworth6825,Farnsworth," Hmm.  It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors.
",62,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6826,Bender," So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although--  What's that?
",88,31,2,18,Farnsworth,Zoidberg6827,Zoidberg," I don't know, but it's infectious!
",36,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6828,Bender," No doubt about it, this place is haunted.
",43,31,2,18,Zoidberg,Hermes6829,Hermes," Don't be silly, mon. The last ghost died over 200 years ago.
",62,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6830,Bender," The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?
",41,31,2,18,Hermes,Leela6831,Leela,"  0101100101.  What does it mean?
",34,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6832,Bender," It's just gibberish.   1010011010?
",36,31,2,18,Leela,Bender6833,Bender," Uncle Vladimir!
",17,31,2,18,Bender,Vladimir-Ghost6834,Vladimir-Ghost," Come, Bender. You'll like being dead!
",39,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6835,Bender," That's what they said about being alive.
",42,31,2,18,Vladimir-Ghost,Robot #1 Ghosts6836,Robot #1 Ghosts,"  Join us! Join us! Join us, Bender!
",37,31,2,18,Bender,Farnsworth6837,Farnsworth," Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly-shielded coffins. Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old, abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms.
",212,31,2,18,Robot #1 Ghosts,Hermes6838,Hermes," Of course! It was so obvious!
",31,31,2,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6839,Farnsworth," Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense. We really should tell Bender there's nothing to be afraid of.
",118,31,2,18,Hermes,Bender6840,Bender,"  Nooo!
",8,31,2,18,Farnsworth,Fry6841,Fry," Bender, wake up!  He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?
",64,31,2,18,Bender,Leela6842,Leela," Bender, what happened?
",24,31,2,18,Fry,Bender6843,Bender," Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!
",127,31,2,18,Leela,Fry6844,Fry," Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or too little, I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly the right amount.
",166,31,2,18,Bender,Amy6845,Amy," Maybe he has. Look at these tracks.
",37,31,2,18,Fry,Leela6846,Leela," I think Bender may be telling the truth.
",42,31,2,18,Amy,Zoidberg6847,Zoidberg," Bender, you look awful. I prescribe make-up. Here. It just so happens I have my Mary Kay sample case!
",103,31,2,18,Leela,Bender6848,Bender," Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running people over.
",83,31,2,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg6849,Zoidberg," Many people dream of a fresh, new look. And Mary Kay can make those dreams come true.
",87,31,2,18,Bender,Leela6850,Leela," Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New New York.  There was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre.
",133,31,2,18,Zoidberg,Bender6851,Bender," Robot porno theatre? I was in that ... general area last night. Whoever ran me down out on the moors must've followed me back here.
",133,31,2,18,Leela,Hermes6852,Hermes," Bender, mon, no one's trying to run you over. Stop being a big, hallucinating baby.
",85,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6853,Bender," Yeah? Could a big, hallucinating baby do this:  I scared!
",59,31,2,18,Hermes,Vandal #16854,Vandal #1," I don't know which I like more: Smashing cars or smashing faces.
",66,31,2,18,Bender,Vandal #26855,Vandal #2," Well, lucky you don't gotta decide tonight. Now come on, we got church tomorrow.  Did you hear something?
",107,31,2,18,Vandal #1,Vandal #16856,Vandal #1," Ah, it was probably just a golden marmoset.
",45,31,2,18,Vandal #2,Vandal #26857,Vandal #2," That don't sound like no golden marmoset I ever heard.
",56,31,2,18,Vandal #1,Vandal #16858,Vandal #1," Made it!
",10,31,2,18,Vandal #2,Vandal #26859,Vandal #2," So anyway, what're you wearing tomorrow?
",42,31,2,18,Vandal #1,Bender6860,Bender," Where--? What the--?  Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened?
",77,31,2,18,Vandal #2,Sal6861,Sal," Gets outta here, yous lousy bum!
",34,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6862,Bender," Please, I'm scared.
",21,31,2,18,Sal,Sal6863,Sal," We're all scared, it's the human condition. Why do you thinks I put on this tough-guy facade? Now beat it!
",108,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6864,Bender," I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke up I found these in my chest cabinet.
",119,31,2,18,Sal,Fry6865,Fry," Aw, relax, buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps.
",74,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6866,Bender," No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh, Lord! I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown.
",88,31,2,18,Fry,Fry6867,Fry," Jeez, Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!
",54,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6868,Bender," You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense.
",63,31,2,18,Fry,Bender6869,Bender," Damn the expense!
",19,31,2,18,Bender,Gypsy6870,Gypsy," My friend, you have nothing to worry about. Except a nightmare-ish life of unremitting horror!
",96,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6871,Bender," Phew!
",7,31,2,18,Gypsy,Gypsy6872,Gypsy," For, you see, you are a were-car.
",35,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6873,Bender," A were-car?
",13,31,2,18,Gypsy,Gypsy6874,Gypsy," The car that ran you down on the moors was also a were-car. It beamed a virus to you through its demonic headlights.
",118,31,2,18,Bender,Leela6875,Leela," That's crazy!
",15,31,2,18,Gypsy,Gypsy6876,Gypsy," Yes. So crazy that it must be true! Each midnight, when your clock resets to zero, your hardware reconfigures into a murderous, four-wheeled car.
",147,31,2,18,Leela,Bender6877,Bender," I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?
",97,31,2,18,Gypsy,Gypsy6878,Gypsy," Yes. But you must be willing to pay a terrible price.
",55,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6879,Bender," Yeah, yeah, yeah.
",19,31,2,18,Gypsy,Gypsy6880,Gypsy," Follow me.
",12,31,2,18,Bender,Gypsy6881,Gypsy," According to this ancient read-me file, your only hope is to destroy the original were-car.
",93,31,2,18,Gypsy,Bender6882,Bender," I'm with you.
",15,31,2,18,Gypsy,Gypsy6883,Gypsy," In its death throes, the dread car will beam out the virus's uninstall program, thus ridding you of the curse.
",112,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6884,Bender," And otherwise I can never die?
",32,31,2,18,Gypsy,Gypsy6885,Gypsy," Who said that? Sure you can die. You want to die?
",51,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6886,Bender," No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!
",62,31,2,18,Gypsy,Gypsy6887,Gypsy," Then live on, forever cursed. Each night, your attacks will become more gruesome until, one dark night, you are doomed to kill your dearest friend.
",149,31,2,18,Bender,Fry6888,Fry," I wouldn't wanna be me right now.
",35,31,2,18,Gypsy,Gypsy6889,Gypsy,"  Now go! Go!  Uh, could one of you just-- Ah, forget it. I'll just sleep here.
",80,31,2,18,Fry,Leela6890,Leela," There. No rampaging for you tonight.
",38,31,2,18,Gypsy,Bender6891,Bender," Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
",64,31,2,18,Leela,Leela6892,Leela," Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil.
",127,31,2,18,Bender,Fry6893,Fry," It'll be a rich, full day.
",28,31,2,18,Leela,Leela6894,Leela," Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them.
",83,31,2,18,Fry,Fry6895,Fry,"  Bender, no!
",14,31,2,18,Leela,Leela6896,Leela,"  Fry, stay back!
",18,31,2,18,Fry,Fry6897,Fry,"  You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?
",91,31,2,18,Leela,Fry6898,Fry," I can't believe this! Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me.
",173,31,2,18,Fry,Leela6899,Leela," Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot.
",62,31,2,18,Fry,Fry6900,Fry," Stop rubbing it in!
",21,31,2,18,Leela,Bender6901,Bender," Oh, God! Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you, did I?
",65,31,2,18,Fry,Fry6902,Fry," Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?
",68,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6903,Bender," I tried to run you over?
",26,31,2,18,Fry,Leela6904,Leela," It was very sweet of you, Bender.
",35,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6905,Bender," Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two.
",60,31,2,18,Leela,Fry6906,Fry," Words. Nothing but sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter, orange wax in my ears.
",85,31,2,18,Bender,Leela6907,Leela," Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've got to go back to the castle and hunt down the original were-car.
",135,31,2,18,Fry,Fry6908,Fry," Yeah, yeah, yeah.
",19,31,2,18,Leela,Leela6909,Leela," Cursed, got it.
",17,31,2,18,Fry,Bender6910,Bender," Whatever.
",11,31,2,18,Leela,Leela6911,Leela," The tracks lead here.
",23,31,2,18,Bender,Fry6912,Fry," Thanks, eagle eye.
",20,31,2,18,Leela,Leela6913,Leela," Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful: Many robots are stupid and violent.
",103,31,2,18,Fry,Bender6914,Bender,"  I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what, I'd pound him till--
",83,31,2,18,Leela,Yokelbot6915,Yokelbot," Get ye to your houses, ye ignorant villagers.
",47,31,2,18,Bender,Leela6916,Leela," We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!
",84,31,2,18,Yokelbot,Yokelbot6917,Yokelbot," Stop! What are ye doing?
",26,31,2,18,Leela,Bender6918,Bender," We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk.
",65,31,2,18,Yokelbot,Yokelbot6919,Yokelbot," Ye think me be he?
",20,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6920,Bender," SÃ_.
",5,31,2,18,Yokelbot,Yokelbot6921,Yokelbot," Nee. I mean, ""no"". I was given the curse many a year ago while on a bird-watching trip to the Arctic...
",105,31,2,18,Bender,Yokelbot6922,Yokelbot,"  I was attacked by a vicious, motorised sled. The natives called it ""The Abominable Snowmobile"".
",98,31,2,18,Yokelbot,Inuitbot6923,Inuitbot," Yes, it's true. I ran over that bird-watching jerk and a hundred others. Even my best friend from aromatherapy school.
",120,31,2,18,Yokelbot,Fry6924,Fry," I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me.
",61,31,2,18,Inuitbot,Inuitbot6925,Inuitbot," Alas, I'm afraid I'm not the original were-car. I received the curse while taking a learning annex class from a famous robot actor.
",133,31,2,18,Fry,Inuitbot6926,Inuitbot,"  You know him as Calculon.
",28,31,2,18,Inuitbot,Calculon6927,Calculon,"  Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills would avail me a sword with which to slay this wretched curse.
",124,31,2,18,Inuitbot,Bender6928,Bender," Let's kick him some more.
",27,31,2,18,Calculon,Calculon6929,Calculon," No, wait, let me explain.  It all began one fateful night a thousand years ago.
",81,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6930,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!
",79,31,2,18,Calculon,Calculon6931,Calculon," Lies! I change my identity and upgrade my appearance every few decades to avoid suspicion. I was all of history's great acting robots: Acting Unit 0.8, Thespo-mat, David Duchovny!
",181,31,2,18,Bender,Fry6932,Fry," Look, are you the original were-car or not?
",45,31,2,18,Calculon,Calculon6933,Calculon," No, but you are nearing the end of your search. For, you see, I was attacked by the original were-car.
",104,31,2,18,Fry,Bender6934,Bender," Give us a name, MacButt!
",26,31,2,18,Calculon,Calculon6935,Calculon," The year was 2019, and I was just a lowly robot arm...
",56,31,2,18,Bender,Calculon6936,Calculon,"  ...working in an automotive research lab. I was working on Project Satan ...  ... a savage, intelligent military vehicle built from the most evil parts of the most evil cars in all the world. The steering wheel from Hitler's staff car, the left-turn signal from Charles Manson's VW, the windshield wipers from that car that played Knight Rider.
",347,31,2,18,Calculon,Fry6937,Fry," Knight Rider wasn't evil.
",27,31,2,18,Calculon,Calculon6938,Calculon," His windshield wipers were. It didn't come up much in the show though. Anyway...
",82,31,2,18,Fry,Calculon6939,Calculon,"  Only after bringing Project Satan to life did they discover they had made a horrible mistake.  For, you see, it was pure evil.
",129,31,2,18,Calculon,Leela6940,Leela," So what happened to Project Satan?
",36,31,2,18,Calculon,Calculon6941,Calculon,"  It's either in Paris, or much more likely...
",47,31,2,18,Leela,Calculon6942,Calculon,"  ...still in the abandoned automotive lab.
",44,31,2,18,Calculon,Leela6943,Leela," You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato.
",103,31,2,18,Calculon,Bender6944,Bender,"  Psst, there it is.
",21,31,2,18,Leela,Leela6945,Leela," It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan?  Don't be afraid. We know what you are.
",96,31,2,18,Bender,Project Satan6946,Project Satan," You do?
",9,31,2,18,Leela,Leela6947,Leela," Would you like us to ... put you out of your misery?
",54,31,2,18,Project Satan,Project Satan6948,Project Satan," Misery? What misery? I love killing people! Squishing them till their organs squirt out like chunky mustard.
",110,31,2,18,Leela,Bender6949,Bender," Look, everyone loves killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends.
",73,31,2,18,Project Satan,Leela6950,Leela," Oh, no! It's midnight.
",24,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6951,Bender," Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!
",44,31,2,18,Leela,Leela6952,Leela," Fry, distract him.
",20,31,2,18,Bender,Fry6953,Fry,"  Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian! 20 points!
",68,31,2,18,Leela,Leela6954,Leela," Oh, no! There's no exhaust pipe!
",34,31,2,18,Fry,Project Satan6955,Project Satan," That's right! Thanks to Ed Begley Jr.'s electric motor, the most evil propulsion system ever conceived!  Take whichever one you want.
",135,31,2,18,Leela,Bender6956,Bender," Oh, boy! I feel like a car in a candy store!
",46,31,2,18,Project Satan,Fry6957,Fry,"  Yes! He chose me! He's trying to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy!   Oh, thanks, Bender.   Too tight! Too tight!
",111,31,2,18,Bender,Leela6958,Leela," Whoa!
",7,31,2,18,Fry,Bender6959,Bender," Uh-oh.
",8,31,2,18,Leela,Leela6960,Leela," Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?
",49,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6961,Bender,"  I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt so empty inside.
",92,31,2,18,Leela,Fry6962,Fry," Bender, I'm alive!  You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted to, and that's what matters.  Here's to you.
",115,31,2,18,Bender,Bender6963,Bender," Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!
",55,31,2,18,Fry,Fry6964,Fry," I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!
",46,31,2,18,Bender,Fry6965,Fry," Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship. We come in peace.
",90,32,2,19,Fry,Bender6966,Bender," Tough luck!
",13,32,2,19,Fry,Fry6967,Fry," Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?
",65,32,2,19,Bender,Bender6968,Bender,"  Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship.
",45,32,2,19,Fry,Fry6969,Fry," Do you think we should?
",25,32,2,19,Bender,Bender6970,Bender,"  Yes, I do.
",13,32,2,19,Fry,Farnsworth6971,Farnsworth," Leela, have you seen the keys to the spaceship?
",49,32,2,19,Bender,Leela6972,Leela,"  I must've left them onboard.
",31,32,2,19,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6973,Farnsworth," Eh, wha? I mean, what?
",24,32,2,19,Leela,Leela6974,Leela," Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether.
",90,32,2,19,Farnsworth,Amy6975,Amy," Oh, no!
",9,32,2,19,Leela,Hermes6976,Hermes," Sweet ghost of Babylon.
",25,32,2,19,Amy,Zoidberg6977,Zoidberg," This isn't good for Zoidberg!
",31,32,2,19,Hermes,Fry6978,Fry," Woo, yeah!
",12,32,2,19,Zoidberg,Bender6979,Bender," Woo-hoo!
",10,32,2,19,Fry,Bender6980,Bender," Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!
",37,32,2,19,Bender,Fry6981,Fry," That's the best thing I ever saw!
",35,32,2,19,Bender,Italian #16982,Italian #1," You stink!
",12,32,2,19,Fry,Italian #16983,Italian #1," Alright, yeah!
",16,32,2,19,Italian #1,Italian #26984,Italian #2," We like you a lot!
",20,32,2,19,Italian #1,Fry6985,Fry," That was great!
",17,32,2,19,Italian #2,Bender6986,Bender," And no one suspects a thing!  Whoa!  And that's how we learned our lesson!
",76,32,2,19,Fry,Farnsworth6987,Farnsworth," You've gone too far this time -- all three of you!
",52,32,2,19,Bender,Leela6988,Leela," What did I do?
",16,32,2,19,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6989,Farnsworth," You left the keys in the ignition. I mean, look at those two. Wasn't it obvious what would happen?
",100,32,2,19,Leela,Fry6990,Fry," Yeah, Leela.
",14,32,2,19,Farnsworth,Bender6991,Bender," We're all very disappointed in you.
",37,32,2,19,Fry,Farnsworth6992,Farnsworth," I should fire you three right now, but I'm just not that cold-hearted.
",72,32,2,19,Bender,Hermes6993,Hermes," You're all fired.
",19,32,2,19,Farnsworth,Zoidberg6994,Zoidberg,"  Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you.  Good riddance to them. Now Zoidberg is the popular one!
",92,32,2,19,Hermes,Farnsworth6995,Farnsworth," Yes, yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg.
",39,32,2,19,Zoidberg,Amy6996,Amy," Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, I've been thinking, do you think we could go out?
",70,32,2,19,Farnsworth,Farnsworth6997,Farnsworth," So, Zoidberg, what's new?
",27,32,2,19,Amy,Hermes6998,Hermes," Tell me, Zoidberg: Is it carapace or carapass?
",48,32,2,19,Farnsworth,Zoidberg6999,Zoidberg," Oh, you know!
",15,32,2,19,Hermes,Fry7000,Fry," What are we supposed to do for money?  All I've got is my frequent taffy eater's card, my first moustache ...  ... and this picture of me and my old girlfriend, Michelle, and that ski instructor she was just friends with.
",223,32,2,19,Zoidberg,Bender7001,Bender," Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund?  Ow!
",71,32,2,19,Fry,Leela7002,Leela," We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!
",67,32,2,19,Bender,Fry7003,Fry," Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!
",124,32,2,19,Leela,Leela7004,Leela," No, we can get jobs.
",22,32,2,19,Fry,Bender7005,Bender," But we just had jobs!
",23,32,2,19,Leela,Leela7006,Leela," Fortunately, I still have our old career chips.
",49,32,2,19,Bender,Fry7007,Fry," Our what?
",11,32,2,19,Leela,Leela7008,Leela," Career chips.  You remember? They assign you the job you're best at.  I tried to give you one and you ran away.  It's how we met!
",131,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7009,Fry," And then what happened?
",25,32,2,19,Leela,Leela7010,Leela," Just give me your hand.
",25,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7011,Fry," Ow!
",5,32,2,19,Leela,Leela7012,Leela," Baby!  Ow!
",12,32,2,19,Fry,Leela7013,Leela," I'd like to reapply for my old job: Counselling defrostees and assigning them careers.
",88,32,2,19,Leela,Ipgee7014,Ipgee," Oh, I was hoping you would come back! I even saved your poster of a chimp expressing your distaste for Mondays.
",113,32,2,19,Leela,Leela7015,Leela," Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, sir.
",43,32,2,19,Ipgee,Ipgee7016,Ipgee," Just put your hand under the scanner so I can verify your career chip.  Calcutta, we have a problem.
",102,32,2,19,Leela,Leela7017,Leela," Delivery boy? I must have mixed up the chips. It's a simple mi--
",66,32,2,19,Ipgee,Ipgee7018,Ipgee," Oh, here's a cryogenic counsellor! Do you like Mondays?
",57,32,2,19,Leela,Fry7019,Fry," They're OK.
",13,32,2,19,Ipgee,Ipgee7020,Ipgee," Then we'll have to redecorate your office. How do you feel about it helping to be crazy to work here but not being necessary?
",127,32,2,19,Fry,Bender7021,Bender," Hey, let's see what it says about me.
",39,32,2,19,Ipgee,Ipgee7022,Ipgee," Welcome aboard, sir.
",22,32,2,19,Bender,Terry7023,Terry," Remember, when the tube opens, say ...  ... ""Welcome to the world of tomorrow!""
",81,32,2,19,Ipgee,Fry7024,Fry," Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what people wanna hear when they first wake up.  Bathroom's that way.
",105,32,2,19,Terry,Fry7025,Fry," So, while you're on the Probulator, tell me what brings you to the future.
",76,32,2,19,Fry,Man #17026,Man #1," Oh, well, I wanted to meet Shakespeare and I figured that time was cyclical.
",78,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7027,Fry," Nope. Straight line.  Ah, the Probulator's done.
",50,32,2,19,Man #1,Man #17028,Man #1," That wasn't so bad.
",21,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7029,Fry," Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet.  OK, it's about to start.
",60,32,2,19,Man #1,Bender7030,Bender," Welcome to the future, human slave.  Ah, relax, chum. I'm not really a giant fly!  I'm a horrible robot!  Kill all humans!
",124,32,2,19,Fry,Terry7031,Terry," Dear God! He's having a heart attack!
",39,32,2,19,Bender,Bender7032,Bender," Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future.
",58,32,2,19,Terry,Terry7033,Terry," We have a cure for it now!
",28,32,2,19,Bender,Bender7034,Bender," Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this.
",46,32,2,19,Terry,Fry7035,Fry," Nothing like a power nap.
",27,32,2,19,Bender,Old Man #17036,Old Man #1," Oh, flies! Flies and gorillas!
",32,32,2,19,Fry,Bender7037,Bender," Stay beautiful, doll-face!  That Probulator sure knows how to please a man. So, what's for lunch?
",99,32,2,19,Old Man #1,Fry7038,Fry," I ordered a pizza.
",20,32,2,19,Bender,Leela7039,Leela," Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener.  Yeah, very funny. Now cough up the $12.95.
",80,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7040,Fry," Sorry, but if it's not here in half an hour, it's free.
",57,32,2,19,Leela,Leela7041,Leela," It's only been 23 minutes.
",28,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7042,Fry,"  Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes.
",33,32,2,19,Leela,Chef7043,Chef," It's only been a-23 minutes, you dumb a-cannoli. You got a problem, we can take it outside.
",93,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7044,Fry," OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can take him.
",49,32,2,19,Chef,Leela7045,Leela," Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform.
",57,32,2,19,Fry,Chef7046,Chef," 35, you stupid meatball.
",26,32,2,19,Leela,Bender7047,Bender," Who should be unfreeze next?
",30,32,2,19,Chef,Fry7048,Fry," No.  No!  Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!
",41,32,2,19,Bender,Bender7049,Bender," Alright!
",10,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7050,Fry," Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure caused some trouble in that bubble!
",82,32,2,19,Bender,Shore7051,Shore," Rest assured, if it rhymes, I can cause trouble in it.
",56,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7052,Fry," Hey, now that you're in the future, you can go live in an actual bio-dome!
",76,32,2,19,Shore,Shore7053,Shore," An unattractive prospect. While researching for the role, I ran computer simulations demonstrating, incontrovertibly, that the whole bio-enclosure concept is fundamentally flawed. Be it expressed via dome, sphere, cube or even a stately tetrahedron, buddy!
",258,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7054,Fry," Oh.  So, how did you wind up getting frozen?
",46,32,2,19,Shore,Shore7055,Shore," Well, while filming Encino Man my intellectual curiosity re: cryogenics was peaked, and I resolved to freeze the weasel.
",122,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7056,Fry," The weasel?
",13,32,2,19,Shore,Shore7057,Shore," Hey, listen, skippy. I was supposed to be unfrozen in Hollywood for the thousandth anniversary screening of Jury Duty II. How come I'm not there?
",147,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7058,Fry," I woke you up early so we could hang out and do stuff.
",56,32,2,19,Shore,Shore7059,Shore," Like what?
",12,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7060,Fry," I love this job.
",18,32,2,19,Shore,Bender7061,Bender," Me too.
",9,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7062,Fry," Showtime!  I'll pretend to be dying of space plague.
",54,32,2,19,Bender,Bender7063,Bender," Boo?
",6,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7064,Fry," Michelle!
",11,32,2,19,Bender,Bender7065,Bender," Oh, my God!
",13,32,2,19,Fry,Michelle7066,Michelle," Fry? Is it really you?
",24,32,2,19,Bender,Fry7067,Fry," I don't know. Is it really you?
",33,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7068,Michelle," What do you mean you don't know? Are you you or not?
",54,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7069,Fry," Who wants to know?
",20,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7070,Michelle," Oh, Fry, it is you!
",21,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7071,Fry," I don't get it, Michelle. The last time I saw you, you were doing great. You had just dumped me and you were well on your way to getting you life back on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?
",189,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7072,Michelle," Oh, Fry. After you left, things took a turn for the worse. I got married.
",75,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7073,Fry," I'm sorry.
",12,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7074,Michelle,"  His name was Charles. He attended a law school so prestigious the basketball team was coached by Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  I put him through law school by working as a dog walker for antisocial dogs.
",198,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7075,Fry," Sorry.
",8,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7076,Michelle,"  But soon after Charles graduated, our marriage ran into difficulties.
",72,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7077,Fry," Uh, sorry.
",12,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7078,Michelle,"  Desperately depressed, I turned to the one thing that could lessen my pain: A carnival. Unfortunately, a corn dog bone got lodged in the control panel of the Spizzler, and I had to ride it for eight hours.
",208,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7079,Fry,"  Sorry.
",9,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7080,Michelle,"  But it did give me a chance to think...
",42,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7081,Fry," I'm sorry.
",12,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7082,Michelle," And I remembered the last time I was truly happy; when I was with you.
",72,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7083,Fry," Aww. So you froze yourself to come look for me?
",49,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7084,Michelle," No, I did it to get a fresh start. I didn't know what had happened to you -- no one did. The police were going to conduct a search but your parents felt it was a waste of taxpayer money.
",188,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7085,Fry," That's the same reason they kept me out of school. So, no one even cared that I was gone?
",91,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7086,Michelle," Not really. Except for one person.
",36,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7087,Fry," Who was it?
",13,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7088,Michelle," Everything is so different.
",29,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7089,Fry," Not everything. There's still a roach problem.
",48,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7090,Michelle," Ew!
",5,32,2,19,Fry,Michelle7091,Michelle," Eurgh.
",8,32,2,19,Michelle,Fry7092,Fry," Nowadays, people aren't interested in art that's not tattooed on fat guys.
",76,32,2,19,Michelle,Sal7093,Sal," I'm on loan from the Louvre.
",30,32,2,19,Fry,Leela7094,Leela," Please, Professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance.
",70,32,2,19,Sal,Bender7095,Bender," Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to ...  ... Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!
",113,32,2,19,Leela,Farnsworth7096,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Og, but I've got a new crew.
",41,32,2,19,Bender,Farnsworth7097,Farnsworth," So, how was delivery to Fantasy Planet, where everyone's fantasies come to life?
",82,32,2,19,Farnsworth,Amy7098,Amy," Great!
",8,32,2,19,Farnsworth,Hermes7099,Hermes," Organised!
",12,32,2,19,Amy,Zoidberg7100,Zoidberg," For one beautiful night, I knew what it was to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honoured.
",92,32,2,19,Hermes,Farnsworth7101,Farnsworth," You see, Og? Everything's running smoothly, yes. And with Fry fired, I can finally leave my jigsaw puzzles out without him eating the pieces.
",143,32,2,19,Zoidberg,Leela7102,Leela," Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know.
",69,32,2,19,Farnsworth,Fry7103,Fry," Hey, guys.
",12,32,2,19,Leela,Leela7104,Leela," Oh, uh, hey, Fry!
",19,32,2,19,Fry,Bender7105,Bender," So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big, old-- Ow!
",60,32,2,19,Leela,Fry7106,Fry," I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to introduce you to my on-again-off-again girlfriend of the past thousand years, Michelle.  Michelle, this is Leela.  This is Bender.  The Professor.  Hermes and Amy.
",203,32,2,19,Bender,Michelle7107,Michelle," Nice to meet you.
",19,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7108,Fry," And this is Dr. Zoidberg.
",27,32,2,19,Michelle,Hermes7109,Hermes," Dating you ex, Fry? Have you lost all self-respect?
",53,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7110,Fry," All what?
",11,32,2,19,Hermes,Farnsworth7111,Farnsworth," This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house--
",47,32,2,19,Fry,Bender7112,Bender," A home invasion by a former roommate.
",39,32,2,19,Farnsworth,Fry7113,Fry," But things are different this time. Before, she was demanding and possessive. But now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time.
",144,32,2,19,Bender,Zoidberg7114,Zoidberg," There you go, dearies.
",24,32,2,19,Fry,Michelle7115,Michelle," It's a relief to meet you, Amy. I'm just having a hard time adjusting to all the strange stuff here in the future.
",116,32,2,19,Zoidberg,Amy7116,Amy," I'm from Mars.
",16,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7117,Michelle,"  I feel so out of place here. I don't understand why Fry fits in so well.
",75,32,2,19,Amy,Leela7118,Leela,"  Probably because he didn't fit in back in your time.
",55,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7119,Michelle," That's true. But I used to fit in really well.
",48,32,2,19,Leela,Zoidberg7120,Zoidberg," Then good luck, sister.
",25,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7121,Michelle," Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but your friends are a bunch of freaks.
",77,32,2,19,Zoidberg,Fry7122,Fry," Yeah, they're great, huh?
",27,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7123,Michelle," I just don't belong here. I don't know anyone, I can't find a vanishing cream that doesn't make me actually vanish. I don't even have a job.
",142,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7124,Fry," Oh, right. I was supposed to assign you a job. Let me just get your career chip installed.  Hold out your palm.  What are you scared of? It's just like getting your hand pierced.
",180,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7125,Michelle," This world is horrible. Let's start over, Fry. We'll go someplace where all we have is each other.
",100,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7126,Fry," Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there.
",51,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7127,Michelle," It's not a ""there"". It's a ""then"".  The future.
",49,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7128,Fry," Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were talking about one of those motels where the bed is shaped like stuff.
",108,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7129,Michelle," I love you. Don't you love me?
",32,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7130,Fry," Well, sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this seems like a big step.
",83,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7131,Michelle," Fry, why must you analyse everything with your relentless logic? Nothing matters but our love.
",96,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7132,Fry," You're right. Let's do this now and let's never regret it.
",60,32,2,19,Michelle,Fry7133,Fry," Michelle, I don't regret this. But I both rue and lament it.
",62,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7134,Fry," The year 4000 is severely disappointing. I miss the year 3000 when life was simple and brains flew through space and everyone ate lasers.
",139,32,2,19,Fry,Michelle7135,Michelle," It's not that bad. Fate brought us together and now fate brought us here.
",75,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7136,Fry," No, you brought us here.
",26,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7137,Michelle," Whine some more, Fry, I really find that attractive in a man. Now come on, build us a shelter.
",96,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7138,Fry," Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. At least we can have a nice place to live.
",82,32,2,19,Michelle,Fry7139,Fry," There!
",8,32,2,19,Fry,Michelle7140,Michelle," You expect me to live in a tiny little hole?
",46,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7141,Fry," It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher.
",47,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7142,Michelle," Oh, look! Some little kids.
",29,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7143,Fry," They'll save us.  We're saved!
",32,32,2,19,Michelle,Butch7144,Butch," I'm Butch, leader of this place. I took your hole and you can't do nothing about it.
",86,32,2,19,Fry,Michelle7145,Michelle," OK.
",5,32,2,19,Butch,Fry7146,Fry," Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society?
",71,32,2,19,Michelle,Butch7147,Butch," Well, alright. But no interfering with our grand works.
",57,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7148,Fry," I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty good civilisation. I think I'll enjoy serving under him.
",95,32,2,19,Butch,Michelle7149,Michelle," You know your problem, Fry? You're not ambitious. You should be chief.
",72,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7150,Fry," What do I need, ulcers?
",25,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7151,Michelle," But I want power. I'm tired of the chief's girlfriend lording it over me with her fancy coyote hide.
",102,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7152,Fry," Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society.
",68,32,2,19,Michelle,Butch7153,Butch," On what grounds do you challenge my authority?
",48,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7154,Fry," Well, I'm older than you. I can beat you up.
",46,32,2,19,Butch,Kid #17155,Kid #1," Yeah, I'll bet he could.
",26,32,2,19,Fry,Butchs Girlfriend7156,Butchs Girlfriend," He's got arm hair.
",20,32,2,19,Kid #1,Butch7157,Butch," Alright, grandpa. There's only one way to settle this: Death rolling!
",71,32,2,19,Butchs Girlfriend,Fry7158,Fry," What's death rolling?
",23,32,2,19,Butch,Orowheat7159,Orowheat," It's like skateboarding.
",26,32,2,19,Fry,Ice-V7160,Ice-V," Except half the time, someone dies.
",37,32,2,19,Orowheat,Fry7161,Fry," Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding.
",48,32,2,19,Ice-V,Butch7162,Butch," Last one holding the bandana's the new leader.
",48,32,2,19,Fry,Michelle7163,Michelle," My mother always said you were a loser, Fry. Now get out there and prove her wrong.
",85,32,2,19,Butch,Fry7164,Fry,"  Beth said that?
",18,32,2,19,Michelle,Butchs Girlfriend7165,Butchs Girlfriend," Achat, shtayim, shalosh!
",26,32,2,19,Fry,Butch7166,Butch," It's cool. Back off!   My knee. I scraped it!
",47,32,2,19,Butchs Girlfriend,Fry7167,Fry," Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take a look at-- Aha!  I won! I'm the new chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!
",122,32,2,19,Butch,Butch7168,Butch," Hand it over, you giant idiot.
",32,32,2,19,Fry,Butchs Girlfriend7169,Butchs Girlfriend," Hey, Butch, your mom's here.
",30,32,2,19,Butch,Butch7170,Butch," Aw, man.
",10,32,2,19,Butchs Girlfriend,Butchs Mom7171,Butchs Mom," Come on, kids. You're late for Hebrew school.
",47,32,2,19,Butch,Orowheat7172,Orowheat," I don't wanna go.
",19,32,2,19,Butchs Mom,Butchs Girlfriend7173,Butchs Girlfriend," Every Monday and Wednesday's the same thing.
",46,32,2,19,Orowheat,Fry7174,Fry," I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out.
",84,32,2,19,Butchs Girlfriend,Michelle7175,Michelle," That's because you're a loser. You were a loser in the year 2000 and you're a loser in the year 4000.
",103,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7176,Fry," Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all. Several friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man. But you wrecked everything.
",150,32,2,19,Michelle,Michelle7177,Michelle," Quit standing up for yourself, Fry. When we get back to the hole we are going to have a long, boring talk about our relationship!
",131,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7178,Fry," Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this:  I'm leaving you.
",51,32,2,19,Michelle,Fry7179,Fry," There must be people somewhere.
",33,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7180,Fry," Yes! Footprints! And hand prints?  But? What's happening?
",59,32,2,19,Fry,Leela7181,Leela," Fry, thank God we found you.
",30,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7182,Fry," Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?
",55,32,2,19,Leela,Leela7183,Leela," It's not the year 4000.
",25,32,2,19,Fry,Bender7184,Bender," You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed.
",70,32,2,19,Leela,Farnsworth7185,Farnsworth," You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they were delivering it to his movie screening.
",84,32,2,19,Bender,Leela7186,Leela," But, when they noticed you weren't him, they chucked you in a ditch.
",70,32,2,19,Farnsworth,Fry7187,Fry," So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?
",80,32,2,19,Leela,Farnsworth7188,Farnsworth," You wish! You're in Los Angeles!
",34,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7189,Fry," But there was this gang of 10-year-olds with guns.
",52,32,2,19,Farnsworth,Leela7190,Leela," Exactly, you're in L.A.
",25,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7191,Fry," But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.
",64,32,2,19,Leela,Bender7192,Bender," That's L.A. for you.
",22,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7193,Fry," But the air is green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.
",70,32,2,19,Bender,Bender7194,Bender," He just won't stop with the social commentary.
",48,32,2,19,Fry,Fry7195,Fry," And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it--  Michelle, baby!
",96,32,2,19,Bender,Michelle7196,Michelle," It's not working out, Fry.
",28,32,2,19,Fry,Shore7197,Shore,"  Tis better to have loved and lost, n'est ce-pas?
",51,32,2,19,Michelle,Fry7198,Fry," That's it. I've had it with women. From now on, I'm concentrating on my career. Can I have my old job back?
",109,32,2,19,Shore,Farnsworth7199,Farnsworth," Why, I've forgotten why I even fired you.
",43,32,2,19,Fry,Bender7200,Bender," 'Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions.
",72,32,2,19,Farnsworth,Farnsworth7201,Farnsworth," Oh, that's right. Get lost!
",29,32,2,19,Bender,Hermes7202,Hermes," People, we got a problem: Little Nibbler's been coughing up hairballs.
",72,33,3,1,Farnsworth,Leela7203,Leela," Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?
",40,33,3,1,Hermes,Fry7204,Fry," He's got me beat!
",19,33,3,1,Leela,Hermes7205,Hermes," Now we all love Nibbler, so it's only fair that we all pitch in and clean it up together. Still, I propose we make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?
",147,33,3,1,Fry,Leela7206,Leela," Yeah!
",7,33,3,1,Hermes,Bender7207,Bender," Alright, yup.
",15,33,3,1,Leela,Hermes7208,Hermes," All opposed?  All abstaining?
",31,33,3,1,Bender,Leela7209,Leela," Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?
",27,33,3,1,Hermes,Fry7210,Fry," He's dead.
",12,33,3,1,Leela,Bender7211,Bender," What?
",7,33,3,1,Fry,Amy7212,Amy," Oh, no!
",9,33,3,1,Bender,Farnsworth7213,Farnsworth," He always seemed so full of life; laughing, singing, begging for scraps. And now this.
",88,33,3,1,Amy,Zoidberg7214,Zoidberg," Why with all the crying?  So that's where I left my shell.
",60,33,3,1,Farnsworth,Leela7215,Leela," I didn't know you could take this thing off.
",46,33,3,1,Zoidberg,Zoidberg7216,Zoidberg," It was starting to get a little cramped in there so I molted, why not? Ah, the fresh air feels good!
",102,33,3,1,Leela,Farnsworth7217,Farnsworth," Stop doing that!
",18,33,3,1,Zoidberg,Zoidberg7218,Zoidberg," So long. I'm off to toss this old shell in the dumpster and maybe pick up those potato chips Amy didn't finish yesterday.
",123,33,3,1,Farnsworth,Amy7219,Amy," Those were toenail clippings.
",31,33,3,1,Zoidberg,Zoidberg7220,Zoidberg," A feast is a feast.
",21,33,3,1,Amy,Amy7221,Amy," Hey, that's my cellphone!
",27,33,3,1,Zoidberg,Amy7222,Amy," Hello?  Hello? Who is this?  Hello? Hello?
",44,33,3,1,Amy,Leela7223,Leela," What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone again?
",49,33,3,1,Amy,Amy7224,Amy," Some guy's been calling and hanging up 10 times a day for a year.
",67,33,3,1,Leela,Leela7225,Leela," Men who call too much are the worst ... I bet.
",48,33,3,1,Amy,Amy7226,Amy," I just wish a decent guy would call me instead of this spleeze-ball who has me too terrified to even answer the phone.  Hello?
",128,33,3,1,Leela,Amy7227,Amy,"  Hello? Is anyone there?
",26,33,3,1,Amy,Kif7228,Kif," I love you.  Why must I be such a coward?
",43,33,3,1,Amy,Zapp7229,Zapp," Kif, I'm headed to the men's room and I'll be needing an attendant, so-- Oh, I'm sorry. You're crying like a woman.  It's alright. I've always thought myself as a father figure to some of my more pathetic men. Kif, old friend, let's rap.
",239,33,3,1,Kif,Kif7230,Kif," Well, I'm in love with this girl--
",36,33,3,1,Zapp,Zapp7231,Zapp,"  Oh, that's rich!  Go on.
",27,33,3,1,Kif,Kif7232,Kif," I met her a year ago...
",25,33,3,1,Zapp,Kif7233,Kif,"  ...when we were escaping from that cruise ship you piloted directly into a black hole.

",66,33,3,1,Zapp,Leela7240,Leela,"  Forget it.
",13,33,3,1,Zapp,Zapp7241,Zapp,"  Then let the negotiations begin. I propose we go out on 10 dates.
",68,33,3,1,Leela,Leela7242,Leela," How about zero?

",90,33,3,1,Zapp,Zapp7256,Zapp," Here's my personal book of pickup lines.  Say as many of them as you can as fast as you can. Don't stop for any reason.
",121,33,3,1,Kif,Kif7257,Kif," Maybe I'll just give her these flowers.
",41,33,3,1,Zapp,Zapp7258,Zapp," Wrong, wrong, wrong! And what's that? Candy? Candy's for dorks! Give me that.  Mmm!

",20,33,3,1,Leela,Zapp7268,Zapp," Kif's not hungry.  Kif, this place is expensive.  I'd like two steaks and the ladies will have some very sensual salads -- with low-cal sensual dressing.
",155,33,3,1,Kif,Morbo7269,Morbo,"  Oh, won't you take me to funkytown,
Oh, won't you take me to funkytown.
 Thank you.
",86,33,3,1,Zapp,Amy7270,Amy," Kif, you're so quiet. You haven't said a word all night.

",25,33,3,1,Amy,Amy7272,Amy," 'Cause I was really hoping we could talk and stuff.
",53,33,3,1,Kif,Kif7273,Kif," Amy,  if I said you had a beautiful body would you take your pants off and dance around a little?
",99,33,3,1,Amy,Amy7274,Amy," What?
",7,33,3,1,Kif,Leela7275,Leela," Lieutenant Kroker!
",20,33,3,1,Amy,Kif7276,Kif,"  I find the most erotic part of the woman is the boobies

",51,33,3,1,Kif,Kif7280,Kif," Is there nothing we can do, sir?
",34,33,3,1,Leela,Zapp7281,Zapp," There's only one sure-fire way back into a woman's heart and parts beyond. I speak, of course, of karaoke.
",108,33,3,1,Kif,Kif7282,Kif,"  My years in the DOOP Boys' Chorus will not have been in vain!
",64,33,3,1,Zapp,Leela7283,Leela," Alright, enough lipstick. Let's storm out.
",44,33,3,1,Kif,Kif7284,Kif,"  Once upon a time I was falling in love,
But now I'm only falling apart...
",76,33,3,1,Leela,Amy7285,Amy," Oh, that's so emotional!
",26,33,3,1,Kif,Kif7286,Kif,"  There's nothing I can do,
A total eclipse of the heart--
",59,33,3,1,Amy,Zapp7287,Zapp," Amateur hour's over.  Let me show you why they call me ""The Velour Fog""! Hit it!
 I met her in a club down in old Soho,
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola,
C-O-L-A ... Cola.
",200,33,3,1,Kif,Man #17288,Man #1," Aw, give us a break!
",22,33,3,1,Zapp,Woman #17289,Woman #1," Get off!
",10,33,3,1,Man #1,Chef7290,Chef," He sickens me!
",16,33,3,1,Woman #1,Zapp7291,Zapp,"  She walked up to me and she asked me to dance,
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said,
 Leela!
L-E-E-L-A, Leela!
Lee-Lee-Lee-Lee-Leela!
Ba-ba-ba-dum-ba-dum-bum!Leela!
",186,33,3,1,Chef,Leela7292,Leela," We're going home. Call us a space taxi.
",41,33,3,1,Zapp,Zapp7293,Zapp," No need. There's not a restaurant built I can't fly. Where to, ladies?
",72,33,3,1,Leela,Kif7294,Kif," Please, sir. Let's just divide up the check and--
",51,33,3,1,Zapp,Zapp7295,Zapp," Let's see what this eatery can do.
",36,33,3,1,Kif,Zapp7296,Zapp," Ah, she's built like a steakhouse, but she handles like a bistro.  She's out of control!
",90,33,3,1,Zapp,Zapp7297,Zapp,"  You win again, gravity!
",26,33,3,1,Zapp,Zoidberg7298,Zoidberg," Look what arrived: My new shell catalogue. So let's try some on, already!  Ah! Muy macho! Hey, gringos, here comes El Zoido to ruin your drinking water!
",154,33,3,1,Zapp,Bender7299,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I find that offensive.
",58,33,3,1,Zoidberg,Zoidberg7300,Zoidberg," You Latins are so hot-blooded!  This one's like a summer guy!
",63,33,3,1,Bender,Hermes7301,Hermes," Look, you fat fish, the Planet Express health plan only covers one kind of replacement shell.
",95,33,3,1,Zoidberg,Fry7302,Fry," I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call the restaurant.
",100,33,3,1,Hermes,Operator7303,Operator,"  The number you have dialled has crashed into a planet. Please make a note of it.
",83,33,3,1,Fry,Fry7304,Fry," We gotta go rescue them!
",26,33,3,1,Operator,Bender7305,Bender," Eh, I don't know.
",19,33,3,1,Fry,Fry7306,Fry," Bender! Think of the seÃ±oritas!

",10,33,3,1,Fry,Kif7308,Kif," So, Amy, um, well--
",21,33,3,1,Bender,Amy7309,Amy," It's always a line with you!
",30,33,3,1,Kif,Leela7310,Leela," What planet is this anyway?
",29,33,3,1,Amy,Zapp7311,Zapp,"  I 'unno.  This whole sector is uncharted.
",44,33,3,1,Leela,Kif7312,Kif," It is not uncharted, you lost the chart!
",42,33,3,1,Zapp,Zapp7313,Zapp," Well, nothing to do now but repopulate the human race.  Just me and you!   And maybe you.
",91,33,3,1,Kif,Amy7314,Amy," What is it?
",13,33,3,1,Zapp,Kug7315,Kug," Me hear people, but me not see people.
",40,33,3,1,Amy,Thog7316,Thog," No big deal. Everybody make mistake.
",38,33,3,1,Kug,Zapp7317,Zapp," Well, hello! I usually don't say this but you are the most beautiful trio of gigantic ladies I've ever laid eyes on.   I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boo--
",172,33,3,1,Thog,Fry7318,Fry," Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?
",35,33,3,1,Zapp,Bender7319,Bender," No. But what do you make of this?
",35,33,3,1,Fry,Fry7320,Fry," I don't know. But it might have something to do with this.
",60,33,3,1,Bender,Bender7321,Bender," Oh, your God!
",15,33,3,1,Fry,Kug7322,Kug," Move! Go!
",11,33,3,1,Bender,Fry7323,Fry," Alright, here's the plan--
",28,33,3,1,Kug,Bender7324,Bender," What kind of moronic plan is that?  Wow!
",42,33,3,1,Fry,Thog7325,Thog," Women go free. Men stay in chains.
",36,33,3,1,Bender,Ornik7326,Ornik," We take them to our leader. She know what do.
",47,33,3,1,Thog,Fry7327,Fry," Pft. A female leader?
",23,33,3,1,Ornik,Leela7328,Leela," Fry, shut up.
",15,33,3,1,Fry,Fry7329,Fry,"  Yes, Captain!
",16,33,3,1,Leela,Thog7330,Thog," This capital city planet Amazonia.
",36,33,3,1,Fry,Leela7331,Leela," Where are all the men in your society?
",40,33,3,1,Thog,Ornik7332,Ornik," Men die out many year ago.
",28,33,3,1,Leela,Bender7333,Bender," With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are you with me, fellas?
",90,33,3,1,Ornik,Thog7334,Thog," Here stadium, where our women basketball teams play.
",54,33,3,1,Bender,Kug7335,Kug," We no can dunk, but good fundamentals.
",40,33,3,1,Thog,Ornik7336,Ornik," That more fun to watch.
",25,33,3,1,Kug,Zapp7337,Zapp,"  Oh, God, you're killing me!  Ow! God, you're killing me!
",59,33,3,1,Ornik,Thog7338,Thog," This our comedy club. Humour here funny in different way.
",59,33,3,1,Zapp,Ornik7339,Ornik," It not reinforce stereotypes.
",31,33,3,1,Thog,Kug7340,Kug," Comedy come from character, real situations. Not abstract craziness.
",70,33,3,1,Ornik,Bender7341,Bender," Translation: Boring!   That's a good one!  Ow!
",48,33,3,1,Kug,Amy7342,Amy," This women-only planet is sounding better and better.

",30,33,3,1,Kug,Kug7351,Kug," Yes. It appear mysteriously just about time men die out.
",58,33,3,1,Amy,Leela7352,Leela," So why did you make it your leader?
",37,33,3,1,Kug,Ornik7353,Ornik," It seemed like different kind of politician.
",46,33,3,1,Leela,Kug7354,Kug," Not beltway insider.
",22,33,3,1,Ornik,Thog7355,Thog," Femputer, we bring offering of bath beads and scented soaps.
",62,33,3,1,Kug,Femputer7356,Femputer," Your gift pleases Femputer. Femputer demands to know why there are men on her planet.
",87,33,3,1,Thog,Fry7357,Fry," It was an accident, ma'am.
",28,33,3,1,Femputer,Femputer7358,Femputer," That does not fempute. Femputer will return after deciding your punishment.
",77,33,3,1,Fry,Fry7359,Fry," Leela, I'm through making fun of women. Now I want them to help me.
",69,33,3,1,Femputer,Amy7360,Amy," Should we do something?
",25,33,3,1,Fry,Leela7361,Leela," There's no hurry.
",19,33,3,1,Amy,Zapp7362,Zapp," Yes! A little tighter.  Tighter. Perhaps a hard spanking is in order?  Too hard!
",82,33,3,1,Leela,Kug7363,Kug," Men strange. You have them on your planet?
",44,33,3,1,Zapp,Leela7364,Leela,"  I'm afraid so.
",17,33,3,1,Kug,Kug7365,Kug," What they for?  Oh, you mean ""snu-snu"".
",41,33,3,1,Leela,Thog7366,Thog," We hear tell men used for snu-snu. But all we have go on are ancient legend and subscription to Cosmo.
",104,33,3,1,Kug,Zapp7367,Zapp," Just FYI, I could be used for snu-snu.
",40,33,3,1,Thog,Thog7368,Thog," Silence. You want die like last men visit Amazonia?
",53,33,3,1,Zapp,Fry7369,Fry," What'd they die of?
",21,33,3,1,Thog,Kug7370,Kug," Crushed pelvises.
",19,33,3,1,Fry,Fry7371,Fry," Yes!
",6,33,3,1,Kug,Zapp7372,Zapp," Oh, thank you, Lord in heaven!
",32,33,3,1,Fry,Femputer7373,Femputer," After lengthy femputations, I, Femputer, have decided the fate of the men. Femputer sentences them to death.  By snu-snu!
",123,33,3,1,Zapp,Fry7374,Fry,"  Yay!
",7,33,3,1,Femputer,Zapp7375,Zapp,"  Yeah!   What are you, gay?
",29,33,3,1,Fry,Femputer7376,Femputer," Death to the men. Death by snu-snu.
",37,33,3,1,Zapp,Fry7377,Fry," Although the snu-snu part's gonna be pretty good.
",51,33,3,1,Femputer,Zapp7378,Zapp," Baby, it'll blow your mind.
",29,33,3,1,Fry,Leela7379,Leela," Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are annoying and they wreck up whatever planet they're in charge of, but most of these men are sorta my friends. They don't deserve to die.
",175,33,3,1,Zapp,Femputer7380,Femputer," Hmm. Perhaps men are not as evil as Femputer thinks.
",54,33,3,1,Leela,Thog7381,Thog," But they make fun women's basketball.
",39,33,3,1,Femputer,Femputer7382,Femputer," What? Did you explain how the women's good fundamentals make up for their inability to dunk?
",94,33,3,1,Thog,Ornik7383,Ornik," Yes. They still laugh.
",24,33,3,1,Femputer,Femputer7384,Femputer," The men must die.
",19,33,3,1,Ornik,Bender7385,Bender," Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. It's an understandable mistake. You can let me down now, thanks.
",181,33,3,1,Femputer,Kug7386,Kug," He big jerk like man.
",23,33,3,1,Bender,Bender7387,Bender," I sure am. But check the crotch.  Nothing.
",44,33,3,1,Kug,Femputer7388,Femputer," Very well, release him. As for the others, take them to the snu-snu chambers.
",79,33,3,1,Bender,Bender7389,Bender,"  I'll miss you, meatbag.
",26,33,3,1,Femputer,Leela7390,Leela," Me too, meatbag.
",18,33,3,1,Bender,Fry7391,Fry," Goodbye, friends. I never thought I would die like this. But I'd always really hoped.
",87,33,3,1,Leela,Femputer7392,Femputer,"  The Amazonians will be divided into three groups. The one called ""Zapp"" will be snu-snu'd by the large women. He that is designated ""Fry"" will be snu-snu'd by the petite women. And Kif, as the most attractive male, will be snu-snu'd by the most beautiful women of Amazonia. Then the large women. Then the petite women. Then the large women again.  Initiate snu-snu!
",368,33,3,1,Fry,Amazonians7393,Amazonians,"  Snu-snu, snu-snu, snu-snu!
",29,33,3,1,Femputer,Kif7394,Kif," Amy, before I die, I have to tell you: I didn't mean to say those awful things on our date. They were all Zapp's idea.
",120,33,3,1,Amazonians,Amy7395,Amy," Really? Honest and true?
",26,33,3,1,Kif,Kif7396,Kif," Yes. And-And that person calling and hanging up was me. I was just too nervous to say hello because I love you.
",113,33,3,1,Amy,Amy7397,Amy," Oh, Kif!
",10,33,3,1,Kif,Thog7398,Thog," It Thog's first time.  Be gentle!
",35,33,3,1,Amy,Leela7399,Leela," We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the Femputer and reprogram it to let them go.
",111,33,3,1,Thog,Bender7400,Bender," Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it!  Alright, I'll go!
",71,33,3,1,Leela,Fry7401,Fry,"  Ooh! Yeah!
",13,33,3,1,Bender,Zapp7402,Zapp,"  Oh, baby!
",12,33,3,1,Fry,Guard #1 #17403,Guard #1 #1," How Tonk look?
",16,33,3,1,Zapp,Guard #1 #27404,Guard #1 #2," Tonk look good. Me fat.
",25,33,3,1,Guard #1 #1,Guard #1 #17405,Guard #1 #1," No, you look good. Tonk fat.
",30,33,3,1,Guard #1 #2,Femputer7406,Femputer," Intruder! Stay away from the mighty Femputer! Guards!
",55,33,3,1,Guard #1 #1,Bender7407,Bender," Time to override the CPU and reprogram this Femputer.
",55,33,3,1,Femputer,Femputer7408,Femputer," Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop it! Stop it! Hey, cut that out!
",55,33,3,1,Bender,Fembot #17409,Fembot #1," Cease hitting Femputer!
",25,33,3,1,Femputer,Bender7410,Bender," You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!
",38,33,3,1,Fembot #1,Fembot #17411,Fembot #1,"  It's true. I disguised myself as a Femputer so I could rule the Amazonians.
",78,33,3,1,Bender,Bender7412,Bender," But why?
",10,33,3,1,Fembot #1,Fembot #17413,Fembot #1," Why? Why? I came here from a faraway planet. A planet ruled by a chauvinistic Manputer that was really a Manbot. Have you any idea how it feels to be a Fembot living in a Manbot's Manputer's world?
",199,33,3,1,Bender,Bender7414,Bender," What?
",7,33,3,1,Fembot #1,Fembot #17415,Fembot #1," And now, my meddling Manbot, there's the question of what to do with you!
",75,33,3,1,Bender,Zapp7416,Zapp,"  We need rest. The spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
",75,33,3,1,Fembot #1,Ornik7417,Ornik," It time snu-snu!
",18,33,3,1,Zapp,Fry7418,Fry," Can't we just cuddle?   Nooo!
",31,33,3,1,Ornik,Leela7419,Leela," We can't wait for Bender. It's time for a woman's touch.  Yah! Hi-yah! Yah, yah, yah!
",87,33,3,1,Fry,Amy7420,Amy,"  Me next snu-snu. Out me way.
",31,33,3,1,Leela,Thog7421,Thog," Where go beautiful man?  Me want snu-snu!
",43,33,3,1,Amy,Amy7422,Amy," Kif! Jump!
",12,33,3,1,Thog,Kif7423,Kif," My hero!
",10,33,3,1,Amy,Thog7424,Thog,"  Me not get snu-snu! Get him!
",31,33,3,1,Kif,Thog7425,Thog," Mighty Femputer. Small girl steal green kissy man. We kill her now?
",69,33,3,1,Thog,Fembot #17426,Fembot #1,"  Come back later. Leave me alone.
",35,33,3,1,Thog,Bender7427,Bender,"  Yeah, get lost!   Ooh! I'm a scary Femputer. Release the prisoners!   And bring gold. Lots of gold.
",102,33,3,1,Fembot #1,Thog7428,Thog," Gold? Why Femputer want gold?
",31,33,3,1,Bender,Fembot #17429,Fembot #1,"  You heard the man.
",21,33,3,1,Thog,Bender7430,Bender,"  C'mon! Gimme some of that!
",29,33,3,1,Fembot #1,Zoidberg7431,Zoidberg," And that's how I got my new shell. It looks just like the shell I threw out yesterday and I found it in the same dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon inside.  Pretty good story, eh, Hermes?
",196,33,3,1,Bender,Hermes7432,Hermes," Stick to someone else, you windy barnacle!
",44,33,3,1,Zoidberg,Leela7433,Leela," It's funny how the battle of the sexes was only resolved when a Manbot and a Fembot realised they loved each other.
",117,33,3,1,Hermes,Bender7434,Bender," Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold says that was the best mission ever!
",108,33,3,1,Leela,Amy7435,Amy," It sure was.
",14,33,3,1,Bender,Fry7436,Fry," Oh, yeah!
",11,33,3,1,Amy,Zapp7437,Zapp," I had snu-snu!
",16,33,3,1,Fry,Kif7438,Kif," So, um, Amy, w-what do you wanna do now?
",42,33,3,1,Zapp,Man #17439,Man #1,"  Breaker-breaker, this here's the Duck. Uh, you wanna back off them hogs?
",75,34,3,2,Kif,Man #17440,Man #1,"  Ten-four, five miles or so.
",30,34,3,2,Man #1,Man #1 #27441,Man #1 #2,"  Ten, roger!
",14,34,3,2,Man #1,Leela7442,Leela," Hmm, I'd better check the fluid levels.   We're OK on Coke syrup.
",67,34,3,2,Man #1 #2,Bender7443,Bender," Oh, man! Come on!  Comin' through!
",36,34,3,2,Leela,Bender7444,Bender," What's that black cracker?
",28,34,3,2,Bender,Fry7445,Fry," A tomato.
",11,34,3,2,Bender,Leela7446,Leela," You're not gonna eat a sandwich from a truck stop men's room are you?
",71,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7447,Fry," Eh, what's the worst thing that could happen?  Ugh! It's like a party in my mouth and everyone's throwing up!
",111,34,3,2,Leela,Trucker7448,Trucker," Lookie there! It's one of them things like on our mud flaps!
",62,34,3,2,Fry,Hoschel7449,Hoschel," Yosemite Sam?
",15,34,3,2,Trucker,Sal7450,Sal," Stands back! I'm gonna puts my moves on her.  Whoas!
",54,34,3,2,Hoschel,Fry7451,Fry," That jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless they're prepared to take it to the next level!
",93,34,3,2,Sal,Leela7452,Leela," Fry, please. That's sweet but I'd rather not even dignify them with an ass-whooping!
",86,34,3,2,Fry,Sal7453,Sal," Hey, sexy mama, let's get busy and freaky in that order!
",58,34,3,2,Leela,Fry7454,Fry," Hey, jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she wanted to make love with you?
",101,34,3,2,Sal,Sal7455,Sal," Eh, I gots five minutes. She looks pretty good for a truck stop chick!
",72,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7456,Fry," You take that back! She does not look good for a truck stop chick!
",68,34,3,2,Sal,Sal7457,Sal," Yeah, you're right. She don't gots enough meat for a guy like me.
",67,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7458,Fry," She does too! She's loaded with meat! She's got more meat than a cow!  Ow!
",76,34,3,2,Sal,Sal7459,Sal,"  More meat than a cow!
",24,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7460,Fry," I can't please Leela no matter what I do. I just want her to like me.
",71,34,3,2,Sal,Bender7461,Bender," Well there's always hope.  C'mon, we gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler.
",77,34,3,2,Fry,Bender7462,Bender," Who are you?
",14,34,3,2,Bender,Scruffy7463,Scruffy," Scruffy. The janitor.
",23,34,3,2,Bender,Bender7464,Bender," Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?
",40,34,3,2,Scruffy,Scruffy7465,Scruffy," Schedule conflict.
",20,34,3,2,Bender,Bender7466,Bender," There! Fixed forever.
",23,34,3,2,Scruffy,Scruffy7467,Scruffy," Scruffy's gonna die the way he lived.  Oh, marmalade!
",55,34,3,2,Bender,Zoidberg7468,Zoidberg," Oh, the hypochondriac's back! So what is it this time?
",56,34,3,2,Scruffy,Fry7469,Fry," Well, my lead pipe hurts a little.
",36,34,3,2,Zoidberg,Zoidberg7470,Zoidberg," That's normal. Next patient.
",30,34,3,2,Fry,Bender7471,Bender," He's a witch!
",15,34,3,2,Zoidberg,Farnsworth7472,Farnsworth," Fry, did you eat anything unusual recently?
",45,34,3,2,Bender,Fry7473,Fry," No.
",5,34,3,2,Farnsworth,Leela7474,Leela," What about that bathroom egg salad from the truck stop?
",57,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7475,Fry," I've had better.
",18,34,3,2,Leela,Farnsworth7476,Farnsworth," Egg salad? Hmm. Zoidberg will have to examine your gastrointestinal tract. Come, everyone. Give Fry some privacy.
",115,34,3,2,Fry,Farnsworth7477,Farnsworth," If you can't see well enough through the two-way mirror, there'll be a close-up on this video screen.
",103,34,3,2,Farnsworth,Zoidberg7478,Zoidberg," Hmm. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.  Guess again.
",75,34,3,2,Farnsworth,Amy7479,Amy," Gross!
",8,34,3,2,Zoidberg,Bender7480,Bender,"  Go, man! Go!
",15,34,3,2,Amy,Farnsworth7481,Farnsworth," Watch for any subtle irregularity in Fry's bowel.
",51,34,3,2,Bender,Amy7482,Amy," It's gorgeous. That place used to be a big dump.
",50,34,3,2,Farnsworth,Bender7483,Bender," Oh! Ew!
",9,34,3,2,Amy,Amy7484,Amy," Worms? Ew! Puke-a-tronic!
",27,34,3,2,Bender,Leela7485,Leela," So the eggs in that egg salad sandwich were--
",47,34,3,2,Amy,Farnsworth7486,Farnsworth," Correct! Worm eggs! And the mayonnaise was probably none too fresh either.
",76,34,3,2,Leela,Hermes7487,Hermes," It's nauseating, mon!  Is there no way to get rid of the disgusting maggots?
",78,34,3,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth7488,Farnsworth," Only one. We'll have to travel deep inside Fry, in this!
",58,34,3,2,Hermes,Bender7489,Bender," Shotgun!
",10,34,3,2,Farnsworth,Zoidberg7490,Zoidberg,"  Shotgun!
",11,34,3,2,Bender,Farnsworth7491,Farnsworth," In each gastro-survival kit, you'll find a rain slicker, a disposable fun camera, and something to protect you against bacteria -- a harpoon!
",143,34,3,2,Zoidberg,Bender7492,Bender," Yo, old guy, why do we have to use those tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?
",87,34,3,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth7493,Farnsworth," Oh, my, no. That would require extremely tiny atoms, and have you priced those lately? I'm not made of money! Leave me alone!
",127,34,3,2,Bender,Zoidberg7494,Zoidberg," Me next!
",10,34,3,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth-Droid7495,Farnsworth-Droid," Anyhoo, your net suits will let you experience Fry's worm-infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.
",123,34,3,2,Zoidberg,Zoidberg-Droid7496,Zoidberg-Droid," There's no part of that sentence I didn't like.
",49,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7497,Farnsworth-Droid," Is everyone present?
",22,34,3,2,Zoidberg-Droid,Amy-Droid7498,Amy-Droid," Right on!
",11,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Bender-Droid7499,Bender-Droid," Uh-huh.
",9,34,3,2,Amy-Droid,Hermes-Droid7500,Hermes-Droid," Definitely.
",13,34,3,2,Bender-Droid,Zoidberg-Droid7501,Zoidberg-Droid," Yes.
",6,34,3,2,Hermes-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7502,Farnsworth-Droid," Here's the plan:  We'll enter the ear, drip down the back of the throat and make for the bowel. There, we'll irritate the pelvic splanchnic ganglion and cause an intestinal spasm, expelling, among other things, the parasites.
",227,34,3,2,Zoidberg-Droid,Bender-Droid7503,Bender-Droid," I'll tell Fry to wash out, among other things, his ear.
",57,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7504,Farnsworth-Droid," No! Fry can't know anything about the mission. If he finds out, the worms will try to defend themselves. They know everything he knows.
",137,34,3,2,Bender-Droid,Bender-Droid7505,Bender-Droid," They know how to make ice cream soup?
",39,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7506,Farnsworth-Droid," Leela, your role is to distract Fry so he doesn't notice what we're up to.
",76,34,3,2,Bender-Droid,Leela7507,Leela,"  Can do!
",10,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Amy-Droid7508,Amy-Droid," Leela, you should really try a facial scrub, for your pores.
",62,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7509,Leela," Look! A starling!
",19,34,3,2,Amy-Droid,Fry7510,Fry,"  Really?
",10,34,3,2,Leela,Farnsworth-Droid7511,Farnsworth-Droid,"  Sh! Be very quiet. We're in the ear.
",39,34,3,2,Fry,Amy-Droid7512,Amy-Droid,"  OK, Professor.
",17,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7513,Farnsworth-Droid,"  What?
",8,34,3,2,Amy-Droid,Fry7514,Fry," What about what?
",18,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Leela7515,Leela," Uh ... what if we go for a walk, possibly, because it's such a lovely day, perhaps.
",85,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7516,Fry," I'd love to!
",14,34,3,2,Leela,Hermes-Droid7517,Hermes-Droid," We gotta get someplace where he won't stick his finger!
",57,34,3,2,Fry,Bender-Droid7518,Bender-Droid," It's hopeless! Abandon ship!
",30,34,3,2,Hermes-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7519,Farnsworth-Droid," Wait! We just have to get past the eardrum.
",45,34,3,2,Bender-Droid,Hermes-Droid7520,Hermes-Droid,"  What are those worms doing to Fry's brain?
",45,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7521,Farnsworth-Droid,"  They're giving it a complete tune-up. A cursory glance would suggest they've doubled his thinking power.
",107,34,3,2,Hermes-Droid,Hermes-Droid7522,Hermes-Droid,"  My God! Soon he'll be smarter than Cher!
",43,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Fry7523,Fry," Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can evoke our deepest emotions.  For you.
",114,34,3,2,Hermes-Droid,Leela7524,Leela," That's such a beautiful thought, Fry. And what's more amazing, you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me.
",111,34,3,2,Fry,Farnsworth-Droid7525,Farnsworth-Droid," Brace yourselves, everyone. We're entering the interior of Fry's nose.
",72,34,3,2,Leela,Bender-Droid7526,Bender-Droid," We're at finger alert five.
",29,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7527,Farnsworth-Droid," Let's just pray nothing stimulates the delicate smell receptors.  Nobody make a smell.
",88,34,3,2,Bender-Droid,Zoidberg-Droid7528,Zoidberg-Droid," Quick! We can escape through that nasal capillary into the sinus.
",67,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Hermes-Droid7529,Hermes-Droid," Strange. Usually you don't know anything about human anatomy.
",63,34,3,2,Zoidberg-Droid,Zoidberg-Droid7530,Zoidberg-Droid," I learned it from a decongestant commercial.  ""Soothing action, action, action, action...""
",92,34,3,2,Hermes-Droid,Bender-Droid7531,Bender-Droid," Where are we? The ass?
",24,34,3,2,Zoidberg-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7532,Farnsworth-Droid," We're in the heart. Better known as ""The Love Muscle"".
",56,34,3,2,Bender-Droid,Zoidberg-Droid7533,Zoidberg-Droid," Where the food is digested.
",29,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7534,Farnsworth-Droid," We should be safe, just so long as nothing makes it beat faster.
",66,34,3,2,Zoidberg-Droid,Bender-Droid7535,Bender-Droid," Abandon ship!
",15,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7536,Farnsworth-Droid," No! Set course for that cholesterol-encrusted valve.
",54,34,3,2,Bender-Droid,Zoidberg-Droid7537,Zoidberg-Droid," It's good cholesterol but it spreads like bad cholesterol!
",60,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Amy-Droid7538,Amy-Droid,"  Look! They're jazz-ercising Fry's muscles!
",45,34,3,2,Zoidberg-Droid,Hermes-Droid7539,Hermes-Droid," He'll be as strong and flexible as Gumby and Hercules combined!
",65,34,3,2,Amy-Droid,Zoidberg-Droid7540,Zoidberg-Droid," Gumbercules? I love that guy!
",31,34,3,2,Hermes-Droid,Leela7541,Leela," It's that jerk from the truck stop!  Let's cross the street and try to blend in with that crowd of pimps.
",107,34,3,2,Zoidberg-Droid,Fry7542,Fry," I don't think so.  Sir, I believe you owe this lady an apology.
",65,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7543,Leela," Fry, no! He's bulging with what could be muscles.  Ooh!
",57,34,3,2,Fry,Sal7544,Sal," I gots your apologys right heres!  Sorrys, ma'am. I've learnsed a lesson about not ogling cans that I won't soons forgets.
",124,34,3,2,Leela,Farnsworth-Droid7545,Farnsworth-Droid,"  Ah, the stomach: Scenic gateway to the bowel.
",48,34,3,2,Sal,Bender-Droid7546,Bender-Droid," Abandon ship!
",15,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7547,Farnsworth-Droid," No! Don't give up now! We're but a stone's throw from the pyloric sphincter.
",78,34,3,2,Bender-Droid,Bender-Droid7548,Bender-Droid,"  Hooray!
",10,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Zoidberg-Droid7549,Zoidberg-Droid,"  Hooray!
",10,34,3,2,Bender-Droid,Hermes-Droid7550,Hermes-Droid,"  We made it!
",14,34,3,2,Zoidberg-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7551,Farnsworth-Droid," There it is! The stately capitol of Fry's bowel. A heavily-guarded fortress surrounding the pelvic splanchnic ganglion.
",121,34,3,2,Hermes-Droid,Zoidberg-Droid7552,Zoidberg-Droid," I've heard of that! Who said I haven't?
",41,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7553,Farnsworth-Droid," If we can stimulate that nerve, the bowel will convulse, expelling the entire worm society.
",93,34,3,2,Zoidberg-Droid,Hermes-Droid7554,Hermes-Droid," But what about the worms in the other parts of his body?
",58,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7555,Farnsworth-Droid," Listen, this is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement. Afterwards he'll be lucky if he has any bones left!
",108,34,3,2,Hermes-Droid,Bender-Droid7556,Bender-Droid," Alright, let's mush some worms!
",33,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Worm Mayor7557,Worm Mayor," Worms to battle stations!
",27,34,3,2,Bender-Droid,Leela7558,Leela," I had a great time today. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. But can I aks you something?
",108,34,3,2,Worm Mayor,Fry7559,Fry," Anything.
",11,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7560,Leela," Why did you do all that stuff?
",32,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7561,Fry," Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even when it's not.
",178,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7562,Leela," What is it? Is it about Bender?
",33,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7563,Fry," No, it's about you and me.
",28,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7564,Leela," And Bender?
",13,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7565,Fry," Bender's not involved.  Leela ... I love you.
",47,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7566,Leela," You do?
",9,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7567,Fry," Yes. But it's only recently that I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you, Leela, and I always have.
",114,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7568,Leela," Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful-- Wait! Recently? Like since you ate that toilet sandwich?
",101,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7569,Fry," Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day.
",67,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7570,Leela," Stay here.
",12,34,3,2,Fry,Waitress7571,Waitress," Freshen your noc-a-tina?
",26,34,3,2,Leela,Fry7572,Fry," Please.  I need something to settle my stomach.
",49,34,3,2,Waitress,Farnsworth-Droid7573,Farnsworth-Droid," The nerve is through here. Where's Zoidberg?
",46,34,3,2,Fry,Zoidberg-Droid7574,Zoidberg-Droid," Yippie-ki-yay! You'll never guess where I've been!
",52,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Bender-Droid7575,Bender-Droid,"  One! Two! Three!
",19,34,3,2,Zoidberg-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7576,Farnsworth-Droid," There it is! The pelvic splanchnic ganglion.  Tickle it and get ready for the ride of your lives!
",99,34,3,2,Bender-Droid,Leela-Droid7577,Leela-Droid," Don't even think about tickling that ganglion!
",48,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7578,Farnsworth-Droid," Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them!
",175,34,3,2,Leela-Droid,Hermes-Droid7579,Hermes-Droid," I call it ""Caribbean Drain-o""!
",32,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Farnsworth-Droid7580,Farnsworth-Droid," Fry will be stuck with the worms forever.
",43,34,3,2,Hermes-Droid,Leela-Droid7581,Leela-Droid," Perfect.
",10,34,3,2,Farnsworth-Droid,Zoidberg-Droid7582,Zoidberg-Droid," Ouch!
",7,34,3,2,Leela-Droid,Amy7583,Amy," I'm OK.
",9,34,3,2,Zoidberg-Droid,Farnsworth7584,Farnsworth," Leela, you ignorant dope! Now the worms will be in Fry forever.
",65,34,3,2,Amy,Leela7585,Leela," So? Did you ever stop to think that Fry is better off with worms?
",67,34,3,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth7586,Farnsworth," Oh, that's stupid!
",20,34,3,2,Leela,Fry7587,Fry," If anyone wants to tell me what's going on here, I'll be in the lounge.
",73,34,3,2,Farnsworth,Fry7588,Fry," Of all the parasites I've had over the years, these worms are among the-- Hell! They are the best! Leela, how can I ever repay you for saving them?
",149,34,3,2,Fry,Leela7589,Leela,"  I'll think of something.
",27,34,3,2,Fry,Bender7590,Bender," 'Ello! What's all this then?
",30,34,3,2,Leela,Fry7591,Fry," Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!
",61,34,3,2,Bender,Leela7592,Leela,"  I should warn you, it's a little under-furnished.
",52,34,3,2,Fry,Leela7593,Leela," I'm thinking of having a window installed.
",44,34,3,2,Leela,Fry7594,Fry," I think the view's perfect already!
",37,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7595,Leela," Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever heard! Let me show you the bedroom.
",77,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7596,Fry," Wait. In a minute.
",20,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7597,Leela," A holophonor? Only a few people in the whole universe can play that, and they're not very good at it.
",103,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7598,Fry," They don't have you to inspire them.
",38,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7599,Leela," I don't have words to say how wonderful you are, Fry. I haven't felt this happy since double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium.
",127,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7600,Fry," When I'm with you, every day seems like double-soup Tuesday.
",62,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7601,Leela," Oh, Fry! I love what you've become.
",37,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7602,Fry," What I've become.
",19,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7603,Leela," What is it?
",13,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7604,Fry," There's just something I have to find out.
",44,34,3,2,Leela,Fry-Droid7605,Fry-Droid," Who controls this bowel?
",26,34,3,2,Fry,Worm Guard #1 #17606,Worm Guard #1 #1," Who wants to know?
",20,34,3,2,Fry-Droid,Worm Mayor7607,Worm Mayor," I am the Lord Mayor of Cologne.
",33,34,3,2,Worm Guard #1 #1,Fry-Droid7608,Fry-Droid," You mean ""colon""?
",19,34,3,2,Worm Mayor,Worm Mayor7609,Worm Mayor," State your business!
",22,34,3,2,Fry-Droid,Fry-Droid7610,Fry-Droid," Your Excellency, have you ever been in love?
",46,34,3,2,Worm Mayor,Worm Mayor7611,Worm Mayor," No. I thought I was once but then I remember our species reproduces with a cloud of spores.
",93,34,3,2,Fry-Droid,Fry-Droid7612,Fry-Droid," Well, a wonderful girl loves me. But I need to know if it's really me she loves, or just what you worms have made of me. That's why, with all due respect, I'm asking you to leave.
",181,34,3,2,Worm Mayor,Worm Mayor7613,Worm Mayor," Listen, you: I was born here, I raised a cloud of children here, my ancestors came over here on the sandwich.  No one can make me leave.
",138,34,3,2,Fry-Droid,Fry-Droid7614,Fry-Droid," Everyone out of my body or the brain gets it!

",15,34,3,2,Fry-Droid,Worm Mayor7618,Worm Mayor," You've damaged your brain, Universe, but no more than a week of binge drinking or five minutes on a cell phone.
",113,34,3,2,Worm Guard #1 #1,Fry-Droid7619,Fry-Droid," I was just working my way towards the medulla oblongata, control centre of the heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, you die with me.

",21,34,3,2,Fry-Droid,Fry-Droid7621,Fry-Droid," I hope Satan has a nice colon, 'cause that's where you're gonna be living!
",76,34,3,2,Worm Guard #1 #2,Worm Mayor7622,Worm Mayor," Stop! We'll leave.  But one day you'll be eating a fast-food burger and boom! You'll be crawling with us again. Ever wonder what makes special sauce so special? Yo!
",166,34,3,2,Fry-Droid,Leela7623,Leela," Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?
",66,34,3,2,Worm Mayor,Fry7624,Fry," I'm about to.  Leela, let me play for you one for time.
",57,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7625,Leela," You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before.
",59,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7626,Fry," Please, it's important to me.
",31,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7627,Leela," What's that supposed to mean?
",31,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7628,Fry," I don't know. I got nervous and I started thinking about neck bolts.  Wow! Did you see that vase break? It was all like--
",123,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7629,Leela," What's happened to you?
",25,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7630,Fry," Nothing. I got rid of the worms.
",34,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7631,Leela," What? Why would you do that?
",30,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7632,Fry," Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them.
",65,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7633,Leela," Well ... which of you wrote me that sonnet?
",45,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7634,Fry," I did ... I think. It was probably about 50/50. But that's how I really felt about you, I swear!
",98,34,3,2,Leela,Leela7635,Leela," I don't know.
",15,34,3,2,Fry,Fry7636,Fry," Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed-- Uh-oh!
",220,34,3,2,Leela,Bender7637,Bender," Sorry you struck out, sausage link.
",37,34,3,2,Fry,Bender7638,Bender," If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!
",72,34,3,2,Bender,Fry7639,Fry," Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up.
",59,34,3,2,Bender,Bender7640,Bender," There you go!  Goodnight. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars!
",84,34,3,2,Fry,Linda7641,Linda,"  In what has become a winter tradition, members of the Zarlon 7 Polar Bear Club today took the plunge into a river of liquid ammonia.
",135,35,3,3,Bender,Morbo7642,Morbo,"  There were no survivors.
",27,35,3,3,Linda,Linda7643,Linda,"  Takes all kinds! And now, with his annual Xmas message, here's the head of the Xmas Safety Council, the head of Walter Cronkite.
",131,35,3,3,Morbo,Walter Cronkites head7644,Walter Cronkites head,"  Season's warnings, Linda and Morbo.
",38,35,3,3,Linda,Bender7645,Bender," This guy's too trustworthy. What's his angle?
",47,35,3,3,Walter Cronkites head,Cronkite7646,Cronkite,"  In all the tinsel and terror of the holiday season we too often underestimate that murderous brute better known as Santa Claus. With images of last year's gingerbread massacre freshly baked into our memories, I remind you to bolt your doors, say goodbye to your pets and lock your children in the closet. This is Walter Cronkite saying, ""I told you so"".
",356,35,3,3,Bender,Hermes7647,Hermes," Sacred boa of West and Eastern Samoa. We've got to secure for Santa's arrival.
",80,35,3,3,Cronkite,Fry7648,Fry," Just as well. I'm getting tired of this wood show.
",52,35,3,3,Hermes,Farnsworth7649,Farnsworth," Cover that fireplace, confound you! I've only a few years to live. I don't wanna spend them dead.
",99,35,3,3,Fry,Leela7650,Leela," We're pushing as hard as we can.
",34,35,3,3,Farnsworth,Bender7651,Bender," Oh, pushing!
",14,35,3,3,Leela,Farnsworth7652,Farnsworth," Oh, we're doomed! Every year we're doomed. Thanks be I had these bullet-proof shutters installed.
",99,35,3,3,Bender,Farnsworth7653,Farnsworth," Bring it on, Santa! That bloodthirsty cadaver junkie can't touch us as long as we're not stupid enough to leave this building.
",128,35,3,3,Farnsworth,Fry7654,Fry,"  Alright!
",11,35,3,3,Farnsworth,Leela7655,Leela,"  Yeah!
",8,35,3,3,Fry,Farnsworth7656,Farnsworth," In a related matter, you'll be delivering this sack of children's letters directly to Santa at his death fortress on Neptune.
",127,35,3,3,Leela,Fry7657,Fry," These letters are real butt-nutters!  Listen to this one:  Dear Santa.
",72,35,3,3,Farnsworth,Girl7658,Girl,"  Please, please don't bring me any gifts. The bicycle you fired at me last year from your bicycle gun really tore up my insides.
",130,35,3,3,Fry,Leela7659,Leela," Awful! Let's read some more.  Dear Santa.
",43,35,3,3,Girl,Boy7660,Boy,"  Please bring me a coffin for Grandpa. You choked him with a chestnut last year and he's beginning to smell a lot like Xmas if you know what I mean.
",150,35,3,3,Leela,Fry7661,Fry," It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed to bring people together, not blow them apart!
",91,35,3,3,Boy,Bender7662,Bender," Sure, but who's going to do anything about it? Certainly not us. No, sir!
",75,35,3,3,Fry,Fry7663,Fry," Certainly yes us, uh-huh, sir! We've gotta bring back the kind of Xmas I remember.
",84,35,3,3,Bender,Leela7664,Leela," Fry's right. It's time to sit on Santa's lap -- and hard!
",59,35,3,3,Fry,Leela7665,Leela," Oh, look! A cute little welcoming party.
",42,35,3,3,Leela,Aide #17666,Aide #1," Hey! Wanna buy a tiny little kidney?
",38,35,3,3,Leela,Aide #27667,Aide #2," I'll let you punch me for a buck.
",35,35,3,3,Aide #1,Fry7668,Fry," Uh, look; we've got mail for Santa. Are you his elves?
",56,35,3,3,Aide #2,Aide #27669,Aide #2," We're not elves. We're Neptunians.
",36,35,3,3,Fry,Aide #17670,Aide #1," We're just shrimp-y because he doesn't feed us.
",49,35,3,3,Aide #2,Aide #27671,Aide #2," You hit me! You owe me a dollar.
",34,35,3,3,Aide #1,Aide #37672,Aide #3," Hey, you got any food? Old teabags, chewed gum, apple cores? Come on! We're starving here!
",92,35,3,3,Aide #2,Fry7673,Fry," But you live in a gingerbread house.
",38,35,3,3,Aide #3,Aide #47674,Aide #4," Hey! It's food or shelter, not both.
",38,35,3,3,Fry,Bender7675,Bender," You lazy runts! Don't you get paid for making the toys?
",57,35,3,3,Aide #4,Aide #47676,Aide #4," Who said ""toys""?
",18,35,3,3,Bender,Neptunians7677,Neptunians," Toys? Toys? Who said ""toys""?
",30,35,3,3,Aide #4,Aide #27678,Aide #2," False alarm, folks! There's no reason to make toys since Santa judges everyone to be naughty.
",95,35,3,3,Neptunians,Fry7679,Fry," That's it! I'm gonna deliver a gift of my boot up Santa's chimney. Where is he?
",81,35,3,3,Aide #2,Aide #27680,Aide #2," There! In his ice fortress.
",29,35,3,3,Fry,Leela7681,Leela," We'll need help getting in. Any volunteers?
",45,35,3,3,Aide #2,Aide #17682,Aide #1," I'll help you!
",16,35,3,3,Leela,Aide #27683,Aide #2," Ah, phooey!
",13,35,3,3,Aide #1,Aide #27684,Aide #2," An omen?
",10,35,3,3,Aide #2,Aide #17685,Aide #1," Dinner!
",9,35,3,3,Aide #2,Santa7686,Santa," Let's see who's been naughty, and who's been naughty!  Mobsters beating up a shopkeeper for protection money. Very naughty!  Shopkeeper's not paying their protection money. Exactly as naughty!  I saw that!  Huh?
",213,35,3,3,Aide #1,Aide #27687,Aide #2," We brought your mail.
",23,35,3,3,Santa,Santa7688,Santa," Don't you ever knock? Who knows what naughty things I could be watching? I get New Orleans on this thing, you know!
",117,35,3,3,Aide #2,Aide #27689,Aide #2," Don't kill us!
",16,35,3,3,Santa,Leela7690,Leela," Santa's a robot, so we should be able to destroy him with a logical paradox. Bender, you'd better cover your ears.
",116,35,3,3,Aide #2,Santa7691,Santa," Holy night! Intruders!
",24,35,3,3,Leela,Leela7692,Leela," Hold it, Santa!  Consider this: You are programmed to destroy the naughty, but many of those you destroy are in fact nice. I submit to you that you are naughty and, logically, you must destroy yourself.
",204,35,3,3,Santa,Santa7693,Santa," Nice try. But my head was built with paradox-absorbing crumple-zones.
",71,35,3,3,Leela,Leela7694,Leela," Wait! This is what we're running from!
",40,35,3,3,Santa,Fry7695,Fry," Faster! Faster!
",17,35,3,3,Leela,Fry7696,Fry," Why aren't we moving?
",23,35,3,3,Fry,Leela7697,Leela," I don't know. Usually when I do stuff like this the ship moves.
",65,35,3,3,Fry,Santa7698,Santa," Ho, ho-- Eh?
",14,35,3,3,Leela,Fry7699,Fry," He's trapped!
",15,35,3,3,Santa,Aide #27700,Aide #2," Now we can make toys again!
",29,35,3,3,Fry,Neptunians7701,Neptunians,"  Toys! Toys! Toys!
",20,35,3,3,Aide #2,Fry7702,Fry," And I can deliver them. Billions and billions in one night.
",61,35,3,3,Neptunians,Santa7703,Santa," Ha! No human could do all that.
",33,35,3,3,Fry,Fry7704,Fry," Evil Knievel could!
",21,35,3,3,Santa,Santa7705,Santa," Nuh-uh!
",9,35,3,3,Fry,Bender7706,Bender," Santa's right. We need some sort of robot.  Aw, crap! I'm some sort of robot.
",79,35,3,3,Santa,Neptunians7707,Neptunians," Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!
",27,35,3,3,Bender,Santa7708,Santa," Bender can't be Santa! He wasn't built to Yuletide specifications.
",68,35,3,3,Neptunians,Bender7709,Bender," Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either.  But that didn't stop me.
",88,35,3,3,Santa,Leela7710,Leela," Bender!
",9,35,3,3,Bender,Bender7711,Bender," Bow to your new Santa!
",24,35,3,3,Leela,Neptunians7712,Neptunians," Our hero!
",11,35,3,3,Bender,Neptunians7713,Neptunians,"  We are free and fairly sober,
With so many toys to build.
",60,35,3,3,Neptunians,Neptunians7714,Neptunians,"  The machines are kinda tricky,
Probably someone will be killed,
But we gladly work for nothing--
",99,35,3,3,Neptunians,Fry7715,Fry,"  Which is good because we don't intend to pay.
",48,35,3,3,Neptunians,All7716,All,"  The elves are back to work today!
",36,35,3,3,Fry,Neptunians7717,Neptunians,"  Hooray!
We have just a couple hours,
To make several billion gifts,
And the labour isn't easy--
",98,35,3,3,All,Leela7718,Leela,"  Then you'll all work triple shifts,
You can make the job go quicker if you turn up the controls to super-speed.
",114,35,3,3,Neptunians,Fry7719,Fry," ,  and   It's back to work on Xmas Eve!
",41,35,3,3,Leela,Neptunians7720,Neptunians,"  Hooray!
",10,35,3,3,Fry,Leela7721,Leela,"  And though you're cold and sore and ugly,
Your pride will mask the pain.
",75,35,3,3,Neptunians,Fry7722,Fry,"  Let my happy smile warm your hearts--
",40,35,3,3,Leela,Aide #57723,Aide #5,"  There's a toy lodged in my brain!
",36,35,3,3,Fry,Neptunians7724,Neptunians,"  We are getting awfully tired,
And we can't work any faster,
And we're very, very sorry--
",91,35,3,3,Aide #5,Bender7725,Bender,"  Why you selfish little bastards,
Do you want the kids to think that Santa's just a crummy, empty-handed jerk?
",112,35,3,3,Neptunians,Aide #67726,Aide #6," Ow!
",5,35,3,3,Bender,Bender7727,Bender,"  Then shut your yaps and back to work.
",40,35,3,3,Aide #6,Neptunians7728,Neptunians,"  Now it's very nearly Xmas,
And we've done the best we could,
",63,35,3,3,Bender,Fry7729,Fry,"  These toys soldiers are poorly painted.
",42,35,3,3,Neptunians,Leela7730,Leela,"  And they're made from inferior wood.
",39,35,3,3,Fry,Bender7731,Bender,"  I should give you all a beating,
But I really have to fly.
",61,35,3,3,Leela,Santa7732,Santa,"  If I weren't stuck here frozen,
I'd harpoon you in the eye.
",62,35,3,3,Bender,Neptunians7733,Neptunians,"  Now it's back into our tenements,
To drown ourselves in rye.
",63,35,3,3,Santa,Leela7734,Leela,"  You did the best you could,
I guess that some of these gorillas are OK.
",74,35,3,3,Neptunians,Aide #77735,Aide #7," We're adequate!
",17,35,3,3,Leela,All7736,All,"  The elves have rescued Xmas Day! Hooray!
",43,35,3,3,Aide #7,Bender7737,Bender,"  Duh! Gee, Bender, how you gonna get through these bars?  I dunno, moron, suppose I bend them?  Duh, OK!
",106,35,3,3,All,Girl7738,Girl," Mommy! Mommy! Santa's through the perimeter!
",46,35,3,3,Bender,Mrs. Grant7739,Mrs. Grant," This is it, kids. Take your suicide pills so you won't suffer.
",64,35,3,3,Girl,Bender7740,Bender," No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got toys ... at very reasonable prices!
",76,35,3,3,Mrs. Grant,Jeffery7741,Jeffery," Don't listen to him. He's the father of all lies and the uncle of all tricks!
",79,35,3,3,Bender,Bender7742,Bender," But I come bearing Tri-ominos!
",32,35,3,3,Jeffery,Mrs. Grant7743,Mrs. Grant," Go for the shins!
",19,35,3,3,Bender,Bender7744,Bender,"  One down...
",14,35,3,3,Mrs. Grant,Petunia7745,Petunia," Well, hello there, handsome!  Won't you have a cookie?
",56,35,3,3,Bender,Bender7746,Bender," Uh, don't mind if I do.  Ow! What's in these things?
",54,35,3,3,Petunia,Petunia7747,Petunia," Why don't you slip into something more fiery?
",47,35,3,3,Bender,Bender7748,Bender," Ow!
",5,35,3,3,Petunia,Kwanzaabot7749,Kwanzaabot," Yo, Kringle! What happened to you, doll?
",42,35,3,3,Bender,Bender7750,Bender," Oh, it's awful, Kwanzaabot. Everyone hates me.
",48,35,3,3,Kwanzaabot,Kwanzaabot7751,Kwanzaabot," At least they understand you, you know what I'm sayin'? Ain't nobody down with this Kwanzaa tip.
",98,35,3,3,Bender,Bender7752,Bender," Hey! Maybe you could lend me a hand with these deliveries.
",60,35,3,3,Kwanzaabot,Kwanzaabot7753,Kwanzaabot," No time! I gotta hand out the traditional Kwanzaa book.  I've been givin' these out for 647 years!
",100,35,3,3,Bender,Fry7754,Fry," Ah! Bathtub eggnog! Just the way Grandma used to drink.  Ew! It went sour!
",76,35,3,3,Kwanzaabot,Zoidberg7755,Zoidberg," Can't I have a scented bath in peace?
",39,35,3,3,Fry,Leela7756,Leela," Remember, Professor, Bender is Santa. So we don't need to hurt him, right?
",76,35,3,3,Zoidberg,Farnsworth7757,Farnsworth," Yes, yes, yes. You sound like a broken mp3!
",45,35,3,3,Leela,Bender7758,Bender," Ho, ho--  Ow!
",15,35,3,3,Farnsworth,Leela7759,Leela,"  Professor! Don't you remember what I told you?
",49,35,3,3,Bender,Farnsworth7760,Farnsworth,"  No!
",6,35,3,3,Leela,Bender7761,Bender,"  Oh, there's gotta be a better way.
",37,35,3,3,Farnsworth,Bender7762,Bender," Bender, you're a genius!
",26,35,3,3,Bender,Vyolet7763,Vyolet," This creates an unrealistic standard of beauty!
",49,35,3,3,Bender,Bender7764,Bender," Now it's time for Santa to screw open his present!
",52,35,3,3,Vyolet,Smitty7765,Smitty," It's Santa! And we got him cornered!
",38,35,3,3,Bender,URL7766,URL," Aw, I smell a juicy promotion for me.
",39,35,3,3,Smitty,Smitty7767,Smitty," And a juicy re-hiring-back-onto-the-force for me!
",51,35,3,3,URL,Bailiff7768,Bailiff," This Xmas Day session of court will come to order. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding.
",91,35,3,3,Smitty,Whitey7769,Whitey," Santa Claus, you stand accused of crimes against humanity. How do you plead?
",78,35,3,3,Bailiff,Bender7770,Bender," Not Santa!
",12,35,3,3,Whitey,Farnsworth7771,Farnsworth," There he is again!
",20,35,3,3,Bender,Hyper-Chicken7772,Hyper-Chicken," Now, Pramala, I know it's scary in that there witness box but t'ain't no need to fear me.  I'm sorry, I thought you was corn. Now, would you please point at that robot over there.  No further questions.  Daddy done good, huh?
",227,35,3,3,Farnsworth,Bender7773,Bender," Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
",59,35,3,3,Hyper-Chicken,Pramala7774,Pramala," Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.
",43,35,3,3,Bender,Bender7775,Bender," And yet you haven't said what I told you to say. How can any of us trust you?
",79,35,3,3,Pramala,Whitey7776,Whitey," Quit badgering the witness!
",29,35,3,3,Bender,Hyper-Chicken7777,Hyper-Chicken," Badger? Where?
",16,35,3,3,Whitey,Whitey7778,Whitey," Whereas I have a ham dinner with mayonnaise waiting for me at my mansion, I find the defendant guilty.  Santa Claus, I hereby sentence you to be executed at sundown.
",167,35,3,3,Hyper-Chicken,Leela7779,Leela," It's not fair. I just hope that dumb chicken is ashamed of himself.
",69,35,3,3,Whitey,Smitty7780,Smitty," Deactivated robot walking. We got a deactivated robot walking here.
",69,35,3,3,Leela,Robot #17781,Robot #1," Hey, Santa, when you see the Robot Devil, tell him I'm-a comin'!
",66,35,3,3,Smitty,Bender7782,Bender," Hey, that guy said to tell you that--

",14,35,3,3,Bender,Aide #17784,Aide #1," Greetings, masters. My companion and I made lots of toys.
",59,35,3,3,Robot #1 Devil,Leela7785,Leela," Outta my way, shrimp-oh. We're here to bring Santa back so we can prove Bender's innocent.
",92,35,3,3,Aide #1,Santa7786,Santa," Do what you will. But we'll see who has the last ho.
",54,35,3,3,Leela,Leela7787,Leela," There.
",8,35,3,3,Santa,Fry7788,Fry," Oh, no! The ice is melting!
",29,35,3,3,Leela,Leela7789,Leela," The pollution from the factory! It caused a greenhouse effect.
",64,35,3,3,Fry,Aide #17790,Aide #1," That would explain this heat.
",31,35,3,3,Leela,Fry7791,Fry," And your breezy short-shorts!
",31,35,3,3,Aide #1,Aide #27792,Aide #2," Uh, yeah! That would explain it.
",34,35,3,3,Fry,Fry7793,Fry," Hurry! We've gotta think of another way to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!
",80,35,3,3,Aide #2,Leela7794,Leela," Especially for Bender.
",24,35,3,3,Fry,Santa7795,Santa," Look out, Earth. I'm dreaming of a red Xmas.
",46,35,3,3,Leela,Poopenmeyer7796,Poopenmeyer," Ah, good old Maggie!  Eh? When I pull this switch, these powerful electromagnets will tear you limb-from-limb, killing you in the most humane possible manner.
",160,35,3,3,Santa,Bender7797,Bender," But, Mr. Mayor, that doesn't sound humane.
",44,35,3,3,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer7798,Poopenmeyer," It is for the witnesses because it's not boring!  The instant this random number generator reaches zero, you'll be executed.
",126,35,3,3,Bender,Bender7799,Bender," Aw!
",5,35,3,3,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer7800,Poopenmeyer," Ten. Three. Twelve. Three again.

",43,35,3,3,Santa,Fry7822,Fry," Don't do it! He's evil!
",25,35,3,3,Bender,Santa7823,Santa," I know he is but I have no choice. I'm running late and if I don't complete my brutal rampage, well, it just wouldn't be Xmas. I guess what I'm asking is: Bender, won't you join my slaying tonight?

",88,35,3,3,Bender,Farnsworth7830,Farnsworth," No heat.
",10,35,3,3,Leela,Amy7831,Amy," No power.
",11,35,3,3,Farnsworth,Hermes7832,Hermes," Huddled together in fear like lice in a burning wig.
",54,35,3,3,Amy,Fry7833,Fry," Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all.
",70,35,3,3,Hermes,Leela7834,Leela," What are you talking about, you crouton? You said it yourself: Xmas should be about bringing people together, not blowing them apart.
",135,35,3,3,Fry,Fry7835,Fry," But don't you see? Fear has brought us together. That's the magic of Xmas!
",76,35,3,3,Leela,Farnsworth7836,Farnsworth," That's a big crock of--  Hold me!

",96,35,3,3,Bender,Bender7839,Bender," Word!
",7,35,3,3,Kwanzaabot,Santa7840,Santa," By the way, Bender, here's a small token of my appreciation for being Santa while I was trapped in the ice.
",109,35,3,3,Bender,Bender7841,Bender," Hey, chief, you screwed up. There's nothing in here.
",54,35,3,3,Santa,Santa7842,Santa," Oh, it might appear empty but the message is clear: Play Santa again and I'll kill you next year!  Ho, ho, ho!

",38,36,3,4,Santa,Mr. Fry7844,Mr. Fry," You can do it, honey! Squeeze one out for America.
",52,36,3,4,Doctor,Mrs. Fry7845,Mrs. Fry,"  Hey, keep it down! It's the 9th inning.
",42,36,3,4,Mr. Fry,Commentator7846,Commentator,"  Here's the 02 pitch to Craypool. He's taking all the way for a called strike three!

",30,36,3,4,Mrs. Fry,Mrs. Fry7855,Mrs. Fry," Uh, you pick. I picked dinner last night.
",43,36,3,4,Mr. Fry,Mr. Fry7856,Mr. Fry," Well, I was thinking of Philip. After those screwdrivers?
",59,36,3,4,Mrs. Fry,Mrs. Fry7857,Mrs. Fry," That's a fantastic idea. More morphine, please.
",49,36,3,4,Mr. Fry,Mr. Fry7858,Mr. Fry," Look, Yancy, it's your baby brother, Philip.
",46,36,3,4,Mrs. Fry,Yancy7859,Yancy," I wanna be named Philip! Me Philip! Me Philip!
",48,36,3,4,Mr. Fry,Mr. Fry7860,Mr. Fry," Son, your name is Yancy, just like me and my grandfather and so on. All the way back to minuteman Yancy Fry, who blasted commies in the American Revolution.  Philip, until I find a suitable model of an ICBM, you'll have to make do learnin' to fear this toy spacecraft.
",270,36,3,4,Yancy,Yancy7861,Yancy," Mine! Mine!

",20,36,3,4,Farnsworth,Fry7868,Fry," I'll tell you when my horse finishes ... bad.
",47,36,3,4,Leela,Leo7869,Leo," In today's field we own four horses and two jockeys.
",54,36,3,4,Fry,Mrs. Wong7870,Mrs. Wong," We just put our best jockey out to stud, Amy. He's perfect for you!

",35,36,3,4,Jockey,Fry7873,Fry," Come on! Come on! Hey, Leela, how about a kiss for good luck?  I meant tongue luck.
",85,36,3,4,Bender,Announcer #17874,Announcer #1,"  And the winner is number four -- Steven.
",43,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7875,Fry," I am so unlucky! I've run over black cats that were luckier than me.
",70,36,3,4,Announcer #1,Paper-hatted salesman7876,Paper-hatted salesman,"  Get your piping-hot horse burgers, horse fries, horse cake and shakes. We got tongue straight from the horse's mouth.
",120,36,3,4,Fry,Leela7877,Leela," Hmm.
",6,36,3,4,Paper-hatted salesman,Hermes7878,Hermes," It all sounds good.
",21,36,3,4,Leela,Paper-hatted salesman7879,Paper-hatted salesman," All our horses are 100% horse-fed for that double-horse juiced-in goodness.
",77,36,3,4,Hermes,Leela7880,Leela," I'll have the cholesterol-free omelette with horse beaters.
",61,36,3,4,Paper-hatted salesman,Paper-hatted salesman7881,Paper-hatted salesman," And you, sir, how can I horse you?
",36,36,3,4,Leela,Hermes7882,Hermes," I'll have a horse coke.

",17,36,3,4,Hermes,Hermes7884,Hermes," Nay.
",6,36,3,4,Paper-hatted salesman,Jockey7885,Jockey," Hey! What are you doing?
",26,36,3,4,Hermes,Bender7886,Bender," This.
",7,36,3,4,Jockey,Fry7887,Fry," Dear Horse God, I know I don't usually pray to you. Sometimes I doubt you even exist. But if you're willing to grant me luck, please, stamp your hoof once.  Come on, number six! Move it!  Don't do that! What are you--  Man, it's contagious!
",242,36,3,4,Bender,Announcer #17888,Announcer #1,"  And the winner is Harry Trotter by the entire racetrack.
",59,36,3,4,Fry,Bender7889,Bender," That'll teach those other horses to take drugs!
",49,36,3,4,Announcer #1,Fry7890,Fry," That's it! You can only take my money for so long before you take it all, and I say enough.  I've got one dollar left, and this one I'm holding on to!  Oh, no you don't!  I may not know much about horses but I know a lot about doing anything for one dollar!  If you think bad luck can defeat me then you don't know my name is Philip J.--
",339,36,3,4,Bender,Paper-hatted salesman7891,Paper-hatted salesman," That is one unlucky guy!
",26,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7892,Fry," Kareem's got the sky hook but Philip J. Fry's got the space hook!
",67,36,3,4,Paper-hatted salesman,Yancy7893,Yancy," Yancy drives; he goes up with his patented space hook!
",56,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7894,Fry," Hey! That's my patented space hook! You stole it!
",51,36,3,4,Yancy,Yancy7895,Yancy," You're not the president of it!

",8,36,3,4,Fry,Leela7900,Leela," Well, someone's in a good mode.
",33,36,3,4,Yancy,Bender7901,Bender," Let's just say I lucked-out at the track! Also, I rigged one race.
",68,36,3,4,Leela,Fry7902,Fry," Pah! I'd have won a lot of money too if I still had my lucky seven-leaf clover. Plus I'd still have my hair.
",110,36,3,4,Bender,Hairbot7903,Hairbot," I got your page, Mr. Fry. Your new hair is ready.
",51,36,3,4,Fry,Amy7904,Amy," So whatever happened to this seven-leaf clover?
",49,36,3,4,Hairbot,Fry7905,Fry," I hid it in a secret hiding place whose location I never told anyone. Not even Scruffy.
",89,36,3,4,Amy,Zoidberg7906,Zoidberg," So the clover is still in the hiding place, maybe?
",52,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7907,Fry," Hey, yeah! Maybe it is still there. Underground in the ruins of Old New York, helping some ant defeat another ant or helping some piece of dirt turn its luck around.
",167,36,3,4,Zoidberg,Farnsworth7908,Farnsworth," Dirt doesn't need luck.
",25,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7909,Fry," I'm going down there to get my clover back. Some of the tunnels have metal bars so I'll need someone who's good at bending. Leela, how 'bout you?
",147,36,3,4,Farnsworth,Leela7910,Leela," Sure. I'll do it.
",19,36,3,4,Fry,Bender7911,Bender," Like hell you will! Bending's my middle name.
",47,36,3,4,Leela,Fry7912,Fry," It is?

",48,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7914,Fry," Here's the entrance.  From this moment on, I declare my bad luck officially over.
",83,36,3,4,Bender,Bender7915,Bender," He was fun.
",13,36,3,4,Fry,Leela7916,Leela," Well, if we get bored looking for the clover, I've got Tetris on this thing.
",78,36,3,4,Bender,Fry7917,Fry," Look, up ahead.
",17,36,3,4,Leela,Bender7918,Bender," Old New York: The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas.
",61,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7919,Fry," Wow! We've got Manhattan all to ourselves! I can finally do all the crazy stuff I always dreamed of doing.   Howard Stern is overrated!  Uh, oops!
",148,36,3,4,Bender,Bender7920,Bender," New York is so burned.
",24,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7921,Fry," And remember when Mayor Giuliani cracked down on jaywalking?

",43,36,3,4,Yancy,Leela7954,Leela," Which way to your house? The sign says we're at 71st Street.
",62,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7955,Fry," 71st Street? Hmm, never heard of it. Downtown could be in any direction.
",74,36,3,4,Leela,Bender7956,Bender," No sweat. We'll just take a spin on the B-train!
",50,36,3,4,Fry,Bender7957,Bender," Ooh! That feels funny!  This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train making local stops at wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors.
",142,36,3,4,Bender,Bender7958,Bender," Wake up, buddy. End of the line!
",34,36,3,4,Bender,Fry7959,Fry," Gosh! My old neighbourhood.  That's the bench where I found some shirts! That fire hydrant! In summer we'd light it on fire! On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter!
",205,36,3,4,Bender,Bender7960,Bender," Was it poorly Xeroxed?
",24,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7961,Fry," You'd better believe it!
",26,36,3,4,Bender,Leela7962,Leela," The old comedians were right, this place is a lot different from L.A.
",71,36,3,4,Fry,Mutant #17963,Mutant #1," Pardon me, but did I overhear you saying you used to live here?
",65,36,3,4,Leela,Fry7964,Fry," That's right.
",15,36,3,4,Mutant #1,Mutant #17965,Mutant #1," Did you know Andy Goldman?
",28,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7966,Fry," Yeah, he was my neighbour. Why?
",33,36,3,4,Mutant #1,Mutant #17967,Mutant #1," I mutated from him!
",21,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7968,Fry," Get outta here! What's Andy up to these days?
",47,36,3,4,Mutant #1,Andy7969,Andy," The short answer is I'm teaching.
",35,36,3,4,Fry,Leela7970,Leela," He seemed nice.
",17,36,3,4,Andy,Fry7971,Fry," Sure. When he's sober!
",24,36,3,4,Leela,Fry7972,Fry," Holy camolies! The house I grew up in. It's still there!
",58,36,3,4,Fry,Bender7973,Bender," Man, Father Time really took a bat to this place.
",51,36,3,4,Fry,Yancy7974,Yancy," That stupid clover is a worthless piece of garbage! Give it! Give it! Give it!
",80,36,3,4,Bender,Fry7975,Fry,"  Mom! Help!
",13,36,3,4,Yancy,Mrs. Fry7976,Mrs. Fry," Yes!
",6,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7977,Fry," Mom, Yancy's trying to steal my clover.
",41,36,3,4,Mrs. Fry,Mrs. Fry7978,Mrs. Fry,"  Yancy, stealing is wrong.
",28,36,3,4,Fry,Yancy7979,Yancy," Come back here, you! I'm gonna pile drive you!  You're dead meat!
",67,36,3,4,Mrs. Fry,Mr. Fry7980,Mr. Fry," What's happenin' up there? Did Kremlin Joe let fly with the nukes?
",68,36,3,4,Yancy,Fry7981,Fry," Not yet, commander. Yancy's just trying to steal my stuff as usual.
",69,36,3,4,Mr. Fry,Mr. Fry7982,Mr. Fry," Well he'd better keep his hands off these bananas. Gonna need them when the radiation turns us all into monkeys.
",114,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7983,Fry," The Ronco Record Vault! Yancy'll never get his hands on you in here or my money back.  Ah, The Breakfast Club soundtrack. Man, I can't wait till I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff.  Stay safe, clover. I may need you again someday.
",237,36,3,4,Mr. Fry,Fry7984,Fry," This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter.
",79,36,3,4,Fry,Leela7985,Leela," And yet you guys never had a single nuclear war.
",50,36,3,4,Fry,Bender7986,Bender," What a waste.
",15,36,3,4,Leela,Fry7987,Fry," This is it. My Ronco Record Vault.  I still remember the combination: Three.  It's stuck!
",91,36,3,4,Bender,Bender7988,Bender," The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is its structural resonance frequency. Allow me.  There we go!
",102,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7989,Fry," Here it is. The Breakfast Club soundtrack.
",44,36,3,4,Bender,Bender7990,Bender," You mean ""breakfast club sandwich""?
",37,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7991,Fry," I hid my seven-leaf clover in this very record jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn't get it.  Here goes.  It's gone!  The whole place has been cleaned out! Yancy stole my clover! That thief!
",190,36,3,4,Bender,Leela7992,Leela," How do you know it didn't disintegrate?
",41,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7993,Fry," Everything else in here held up OK.
",37,36,3,4,Leela,Bender7994,Bender," Except Sports by Huey Lewis.
",30,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7995,Fry," I don't know why my brother hated me so much.
",47,36,3,4,Bender,Leela7996,Leela," Oh, brothers always fight. I'm sure deep down he loved you. He just never got a chance to say it before you got frozen.
",121,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7997,Fry," You think? 'Cause I always kinda wished that--
",48,36,3,4,Leela,Bender7998,Bender," Who is that God-like figure?
",30,36,3,4,Fry,Fry7999,Fry," It's my brother, Yancy! And there, in his lapel, my seven-leaf clover! I knew he stole it.
",92,36,3,4,Bender,Leela8000,Leela," Hold the phone. If that's Yancy, why does the inscription say Philip J. Fry?
",78,36,3,4,Fry,Fry8001,Fry," Wait a second. That's my name! Good Lord. He ditched his goofy name and stole mine!
",85,36,3,4,Leela,Bender8002,Bender," Apparently this brave Adonis, this Cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars.
",83,36,3,4,Fry,Fry8003,Fry," First person on Mars? I should have been the first person on Mars. He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life.  And now he broke my hand!
",154,36,3,4,Bender,Bender8004,Bender," His legend lives on.
",22,36,3,4,Fry,Farnsworth8005,Farnsworth," So you opened the record vault and the clover was gone?
",57,36,3,4,Bender,Bender8006,Bender," Yep. Nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980's in one amazing collection.
",87,36,3,4,Farnsworth,Leela8007,Leela," Survivor, Pat Benatar, The Scorpions. The list goes on.
",57,36,3,4,Bender,Fry8008,Fry," That clover helped my ratfink brother steal my dream of going into space. Now I'll never get there.
",101,36,3,4,Leela,Leela8009,Leela," You went there this morning for doughnuts.
",44,36,3,4,Fry,Hermes8010,Hermes," First person on Mars? Oh, so your brother was that Philip J. Fry.
",67,36,3,4,Leela,Fry8011,Fry," I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name after I got frozen.
",57,36,3,4,Hermes,Farnsworth8012,Farnsworth," Shut up, friends. My Internet browser heard us saying the word ""Fry"" and it found a movie about Philip J. Fry for us.  It also opened my calendar to Friday and ordered me some French fries.
",191,36,3,4,Fry,Narrator8013,Narrator,"  Philip J. Fry: Astronaut, philanthropist, entrepreneur was a great man truly worthy of narration. Fry was the first man on Mars ...  ... a feat that has never since been equalled.
",182,36,3,4,Farnsworth,Fry8014,Fry," That should have been me!
",27,36,3,4,Narrator,Narrator8015,Narrator,"  The ever-lucky Fry made his fortune after striking oil in the bathroom of the mansion he had won in a lottery.
",113,36,3,4,Fry,Fry8016,Fry," That's my clover! Yancy stole it!
",35,36,3,4,Narrator,Narrator8017,Narrator,"  After a whirlwind fling with Icelandic supermodel NjÃ¶rd, Fry scored a string of top 10 hits with his rock band Leaf Seven, known for their hypnotic rhythms, driving baselines and memorable hooks.
",198,36,3,4,Fry,Fry8018,Fry," That's what I'm known for!
",28,36,3,4,Narrator,Man #18019,Man #1,"  Phil came in, right, strummed out this tune, yeah, and I said, ""That's a number one record!""
",95,36,3,4,Fry,Narrator8020,Narrator,"  Today, Fry spends most of his time in his grave in Orbiting Meadows National Cemetery, buried with the trademark seven-leaf clover that will bring him luck in the next life, perhaps some Egyptians believe.
",208,36,3,4,Man #1,Fry8021,Fry," So that's where my clover is? Hey, is that orbiting cemetery near here?
",73,36,3,4,Narrator,Leela8022,Leela," It will be in a couple hours.
",31,36,3,4,Fry,Fry8023,Fry," Good. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.
",49,36,3,4,Leela,Bender8024,Bender," I'll get my kit.
",18,36,3,4,Fry,Yancy8025,Yancy," Thanks for lending me your tux, Dad. It'll be perfect for my wedding.
",71,36,3,4,Bender,Mr. Fry8026,Mr. Fry," Yancy, that tux got me through 'Nam in style.  I just wish your brother were still around to see this.
",104,36,3,4,Yancy,Mrs. Fry8027,Mrs. Fry," I'll never forget the day Philip disappeared. Wisconsin won the Rose Bowl 17-9. Oh, I miss him.
",97,36,3,4,Mr. Fry,Yancy8028,Yancy," Oh, that reminds me: I was thinking I'd rummage through Phil's records for something to play at the wedding.
",110,36,3,4,Mrs. Fry,Mrs. Fry8029,Mrs. Fry," Have a look downstairs. Your brother may be missing but his crap sure isn't.
",78,36,3,4,Yancy,Yancy8030,Yancy," Hmm, Breakfast Club. This'll clear out the room at the end of the reception.
",78,36,3,4,Mrs. Fry,Leela8031,Leela," They buried your brother in the World Heroes section? I'm impressed.
",70,36,3,4,Yancy,Fry8032,Fry," I should be the one in that grave!
",36,36,3,4,Leela,Fry8033,Fry," Hmm. We lost Bender.
",22,36,3,4,Fry,Bender8034,Bender," There! Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine.
",77,36,3,4,Fry,Fry8035,Fry," Aha! My brother's grave!
",26,36,3,4,Bender,Leela8036,Leela,"  Philip Fry, the original Martian.
",36,36,3,4,Fry,Fry8037,Fry," It's all lies, every word of it! He wasn't original, he wasn't a Martian, he wasn't Philip Fry and since when is he a the?
",124,36,3,4,Leela,Bender8038,Bender," You're twice the the he ever was.
",35,36,3,4,Fry,Fry8039,Fry," It's clovering time!
",22,36,3,4,Bender,Yancys wife8040,Yancys wife," So, had any ideas for names, Yancy?
",37,36,3,4,Fry,Yancy8041,Yancy," Uh, I'm sorta thinking one.  Daddy has a present for you today. Do you know what it is?  It's a lucky clover that can help you be successful whatever you do -- even breakdancing -- and it once belonged to someone very special.
",228,36,3,4,Yancys wife,Yancys wife8042,Yancys wife," I know what name you wanna give him Yancy. It's OK.
",53,36,3,4,Yancy,Yancy8043,Yancy," Really?  Son, I'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honour of my little brother, who I miss every day. I love you, Philip, and I always will.
",137,36,3,4,Yancys wife,Fry8044,Fry,"  Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle to carry on his spirit.
",71,36,3,4,Yancy,Bender8045,Bender," Pay dirt! I got the clover! Plus his wedding ring.  Sorry, ladies, I'm taken! Hey, Fry, you want me to smack the corpse up a little?
",134,36,3,4,Fry,Leela8046,Leela," Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone.
",47,36,3,4,Bender,Bender8047,Bender," Alright, grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
",76,36,3,4,Leela,Leela8048,Leela," Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious but they produce an awful lot of trash.
",87,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8049,Bender," Ah!
",5,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8050,Leela," And, Bender, that aerosol head spray makes your antenna smell nice--
",70,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8051,Bender," Thank you.
",12,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8052,Leela," But it's doing long-term damage to the planet.
",48,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8053,Bender," So? It's not like it's the only one we've got.
",48,37,3,5,Leela,Farnsworth8054,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I'm sending you on an extremely controversial mission.
",77,37,3,5,Bender,Fry8055,Fry," Controversial?
",16,37,3,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth8056,Farnsworth," Oh, my, no.
",13,37,3,5,Fry,Farnsworth8057,Farnsworth," For this highly controversial mission you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an orbiting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter.
",133,37,3,5,Farnsworth,Leela8058,Leela," Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak.
",67,37,3,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth8059,Farnsworth," Impossible!  The tanker has 6,000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof.  Now, once you've hauled the tanker past the protestors--
",141,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8060,Leela," Protestors?
",13,37,3,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth8061,Farnsworth," Correct. 6,000 hulls.
",23,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8062,Leela," Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto?
",76,37,3,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth8063,Farnsworth,"  To avoid the tollbooth.
",26,37,3,5,Leela,Fry8064,Fry," OK, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going.
",62,37,3,5,Farnsworth,Leela8065,Leela," At the risk of sounding negative: No! Look, Professor, I can't participate in this mission.
",93,37,3,5,Fry,Farnsworth8066,Farnsworth," What are you yapping about?
",29,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8067,Leela," This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna go join those protestors.
",106,37,3,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth8068,Farnsworth," This is an outrage! I demand you hand over your captain's jacket.
",67,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8069,Leela," This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.
",53,37,3,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth8070,Farnsworth," I said hand it over!  Well, Fry, or should I say Captain Fry?  No, I shouldn't. Because Bender is the new captain!
",116,37,3,5,Leela,Fry8071,Fry," Bender?
",9,37,3,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth8072,Farnsworth," That's right. Being captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job.
",153,37,3,5,Fry,Bender8073,Bender," Well, I do think of human life as expendable.
",47,37,3,5,Farnsworth,Fry8074,Fry," No fair! Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer -- in this comic I drew.
",113,37,3,5,Bender,Zoidberg8075,Zoidberg," Ooh! The new one's out!
",25,37,3,5,Fry,Bender8076,Bender," Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic.  Now look spry, men! We launch at six bells!
",152,37,3,5,Zoidberg,Waterfall Sr.8077,Waterfall Sr.," Greetings, Econauts. I'm Free Waterfall Sr., founder of Penguins Unlimited.  Whoa! No, no! No applause. Every time you clap your hands you kill thousands of spores that'll some day form a nutritious fungus. Just show your approval with a mould-friendly thumbs up.  Please hold your thumbs until the end. Now, folks, it's time to stop that tanker with a non-violent human circle.
",380,37,3,5,Bender,Leela8078,Leela,"  Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?
",76,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8079,Waterfall Sr.," Now, little lady, those people's asses are living things too.
",63,37,3,5,Leela,Bender8080,Bender," Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease, men.
",70,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Fry8081,Fry," I am at ease.
",15,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8082,Bender," Mr. Fry, I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on you will be known as ... Wiggles!
",107,37,3,5,Fry,Fry8083,Fry," The hell I will! Have you even read the Captain's Handbook?
",61,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8084,Bender," I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?
",65,37,3,5,Fry,Fry8085,Fry," Always respect the chain o' command ... captain.
",50,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8086,Bender," Correct, Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table
",75,37,3,5,Fry,Zoidberg8087,Zoidberg,"  The captain's table! What an honour!
",39,37,3,5,Bender,Waterfall Sr.8088,Waterfall Sr.," Our peace ring has 'em trapped like a tiger in a washing machine!
",67,37,3,5,Zoidberg,Leela8089,Leela," Get ready!
",12,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Protestor #18090,Protestor #1," Look out!
",11,37,3,5,Leela,Protestor #28091,Protestor #2," Hold on!
",10,37,3,5,Protestor #1,Waterfall Sr.8092,Waterfall Sr.," Here they come!
",17,37,3,5,Protestor #2,Leela8093,Leela," When you were planning this peace ring, didn't you realise spaceships can move in three dimensions?
",101,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8094,Waterfall Sr.," No, I did not.
",16,37,3,5,Leela,Waterfall Sr.8095,Waterfall Sr.," Folks, that tanker gave us the slip, but we'll stop 'em here on Pluto. If you're cold, rub your bodies with permafrost. It's nature's long johns.  If rubbing frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey, I don't wanna be right!
",225,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8096,Waterfall Sr.," This here is our penguin preserve.
",36,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Leela8097,Leela," Aw! They're so cute! They're like if puppies and kittens could have babies!
",77,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8098,Waterfall Sr.," We use hand puppets around the young'uns to simulate a natural environment.
",77,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8099,Leela," That's adorable!
",18,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Bender8100,Bender," But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of, Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it.
",183,37,3,5,Leela,Zoidberg8101,Zoidberg," Brilliant!
",12,37,3,5,Bender,Fry8102,Fry," Would you cram a sock in it, Bender? Those aren't even medals, they're bottle-caps and pepperoni slices!
",106,37,3,5,Zoidberg,Bender8103,Bender," Thank you, steward. Wiggles, weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?
",92,37,3,5,Fry,Fry8104,Fry," Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender, he's the best ...  ... at being a big jerk who's stupid and his big, ugly face is as dumb as a butt.
",145,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8105,Bender," Eh, I've heard better.
",24,37,3,5,Fry,Fry8106,Fry," If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.
",88,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8107,Bender," Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!
",36,37,3,5,Fry,Fry8108,Fry," Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.
",83,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8109,Bender," Going? But a captain can't drink without his first mate.
",58,37,3,5,Fry,Zoidberg8110,Zoidberg," You can drink with me maybe?
",30,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8111,Bender," I don't feel like drinking.
",29,37,3,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8112,Zoidberg," Then, if you'll excuse me, I see some ravioli that only has two shoe prints on it.  Three.
",92,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8113,Bender,"  Oh, Greenland is a barren land,
A land that bears no green,
Where there's ice and snow,
And the whale fishes blow,
And the--
",127,37,3,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8114,Zoidberg," Captain, please, have some liquor. You robots need alcohol to function.
",73,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8115,Bender,"  Gah! I once knew a guy ... you look like him. But he wasn't either.  I'm a good captain.
",91,37,3,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8116,Zoidberg," Please, sir, I love you like a father!
",40,37,3,5,Bender,Protestor #38117,Protestor #3," Here they come. Oh, I hope they read my sign!
",47,37,3,5,Zoidberg,Leela8118,Leela," Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!
",48,37,3,5,Protestor #3,Protestor #38119,Protestor #3," He must be talking on a cell phone!
",37,37,3,5,Leela,Fry8120,Fry," What's happening?
",19,37,3,5,Protestor #3,Zoidberg8121,Zoidberg," All 6,000 hulls have been breached!
",37,37,3,5,Fry,Fry8122,Fry," Oh, the fools! If only they'd built it with 6,001 hulls! When will they learn?
",80,37,3,5,Zoidberg,Linda8123,Linda,"  Continuing our coverage of a tragic  but far away  story. The crisis on Pluto worsens as dark matter spreads throughout the penguin habitat. The images are truly horrific.
",174,37,3,5,Fry,Leela8124,Leela,"  I don't think any of us can understand how those poor, oil-drenched penguins feel.
",85,37,3,5,Linda,Morbo8125,Morbo,"  Oily humanoid!  At the time of the crash, the tanker captain had an alcohol level of .08 percent -- well below the legal limit for robots.
",141,37,3,5,Leela,Hyper-Chicken8126,Hyper-Chicken," Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
",175,37,3,5,Morbo,Bender8127,Bender," Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just got me the death penalty?
",66,37,3,5,Hyper-Chicken,Hyper-Chicken8128,Hyper-Chicken," I'd have done better but it's plum hard pleadin' a case while awaitin' trial for that there incompetence!
",107,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8129,Bender," Yeah, uh, good luck with that.
",32,37,3,5,Hyper-Chicken,Leela8130,Leela," Now you stay away from those puffin twins.
",44,37,3,5,Bender,Waterfall Sr.8131,Waterfall Sr.," Good way to avoid frostbite, folks: Put your hands between your buttocks. That's nature's pocket.
",99,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8132,Leela," Uh ... I think I'll go check on Bender.
",41,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8133,Waterfall Sr.," Watch that he doesn't pick your pocket.
",41,37,3,5,Leela,Bender8134,Bender," Ah, can't beat fresh-squeezed!
",32,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Leela8135,Leela," Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished?  And clean the black parts too.
",89,37,3,5,Bender,Smitty8136,Smitty," Are they black with white feathers or white with black feathers?
",66,37,3,5,Leela,URL8137,URL," It don't matter, baby, they're all beautiful!
",47,37,3,5,Smitty,Bender8138,Bender," Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here?  Oh, ho! What's this?
",58,37,3,5,URL,URL8139,URL," Aw, man! He got away!
",23,37,3,5,Bender,Smitty8140,Smitty," I guess this is why Chief says no hugging.
",44,37,3,5,URL,Waterfall Sr.8141,Waterfall Sr.," Good work, everyone. I suggest you all go get some sleep. Me, well, I'm gonna stay up all night singing songs about penguins in a fine, piercing tenor.
",153,37,3,5,Smitty,Leela8142,Leela," Has anyone seen Bender?  Bender?  Here robot, robot, robot.
",61,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Leela8143,Leela," Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?
",56,37,3,5,Leela,Zoidberg8144,Zoidberg," They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job.   And eating penguin eggs.
",81,37,3,5,Leela,Fry8145,Fry," You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other planet?
",90,37,3,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8146,Zoidberg," Damnit, Fry! He may have done wrong, but he's still your captain.
",67,37,3,5,Fry,Leela8147,Leela," I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group.
",60,37,3,5,Zoidberg,Fry8148,Fry," He didn't?
",12,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8149,Leela," No, and with wind-chill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him.
",86,37,3,5,Fry,Fry8150,Fry," Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means.  To the ship.
",130,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8151,Leela," Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.
",64,37,3,5,Fry,Fry8152,Fry," Madam, I am in command now.
",29,37,3,5,Leela,Zoidberg8153,Zoidberg," Such a man! I'd follow him to hell and back, I would.
",55,37,3,5,Fry,Bender8154,Bender," What the--?  What's this water made of, ice? Forget this!
",59,37,3,5,Zoidberg,Penguin #18155,Penguin #1,"  Full of fish?
",16,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8156,Bender,"  Not entirely.
",16,37,3,5,Penguin #1,Penguin #18157,Penguin #1,"  Then let's fish.
",19,37,3,5,Bender,Zoidberg8158,Zoidberg," Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto any longer. In fact, we may have left space as we know it.
",98,37,3,5,Penguin #1,Fry8159,Fry," Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate.
",55,37,3,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8160,Zoidberg,"  Stop yelling at me!
",22,37,3,5,Fry,Waterfall Sr.8161,Waterfall Sr.," Folks, it's worse than we thought. Seems dark matter is nature's sex drug. It's like a perverted trail mix of penguin oestrogen, penguin Viagra and Spanish penguin fly. Why, it's making them ultra-fertile.
",207,37,3,5,Zoidberg,Leela8162,Leela," How ultra?
",12,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8163,Waterfall Sr.," Well your garden variety penguin lays one egg a year. Since the spill our penguins have been laying six eggs every 15 minutes.  Also, the eggs hatch in only 12 hours.  Also, the males are laying eggs.
",202,37,3,5,Leela,Doctor8164,Doctor," This man is over-gasped.
",26,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8165,Waterfall Sr.," If the birds keep multiplying there'll soon be too many to count.  Before long the penguins will exhaust their food supply and starve to death.
",145,37,3,5,Doctor,Leela8166,Leela," Oh, if only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this might never have happened. Can't we stop them from multiplying?
",140,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8167,Waterfall Sr.," Yes, I reckon it is our responsibility. And thankfully we have a plan.
",72,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8168,Leela," What is it? We'll do anything.
",32,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8169,Waterfall Sr.," Everyone, grab your guns. I declare penguin hunting season officially open.
",77,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8170,Leela," You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there some way to keep them from breeding?
",76,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8171,Waterfall Sr.," Cold showers don't work on Antarctic creatures. Now surely you agree that a quick, semi-painless death is a damn sight better than weeks of starvation.
",153,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8172,Leela," Well, I suppose... But-- I mean-- I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, not to hunt them.
",99,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8173,Waterfall Sr.," This time the two are one and the same! Now are you with us or are you gonna let innocent penguins suffer?
",108,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8174,Leela,"  Oh, God! It's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!
",58,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8175,Waterfall Sr.," That's a good old-fashioned gun. Simple point-and-click interface. Rifle check!
",81,37,3,5,Leela,Hunter #18176,Hunter #1," Oh, yeah!
",11,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Hunter #28177,Hunter #2," Wee doggy!
",12,37,3,5,Hunter #1,Leela8178,Leela," Hey, you're enjoying this.
",28,37,3,5,Hunter #2,Waterfall Sr.8179,Waterfall Sr.," Look, nobody enjoys shooting penguins. But if you have to shoot penguins, well, you might as well enjoy it.
",109,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8180,Leela," I'm sorry, but if it's fun in any way it's not environmentalism.
",66,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8181,Waterfall Sr.," Oh, really? How 'bout blowing up dams?
",40,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8182,Leela," Yeah ... that is fun.
",23,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8183,Waterfall Sr.," Let's conservate!
",19,37,3,5,Leela,Zoidberg8184,Zoidberg,"  It's been an honour to serve under you, sir!
",47,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Leela8185,Leela," Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families.  But they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering a little butler. I-I can't look.   Oh, no! What have I done?  Oh, you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I-- Bender?  Bend. 2] Cheese It! He stands up and takes the bullet out of his head. Leela stops crying.] What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?
",421,37,3,5,Zoidberg,Bender8186,Bender," Of course not. Filthy ice rats! Scat! Shoo!  Gah! What are you doing? Get away!
",81,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8187,Leela," Aw! They love you!
",20,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8188,Bender," Well I don't love them.  Aw!  I don't know why but when I look down at their little faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!
",131,37,3,5,Leela,Penguins8189,Penguins,"  Stand still. It's our only hope.
",35,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8190,Bender,"  That's puffin talk. Now follow me!
",37,37,3,5,Penguins,Leela8191,Leela," Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela.
",38,37,3,5,Bender,Hunter #28192,Hunter #2," Sorry.
",8,37,3,5,Leela,Waterfall Sr.8193,Waterfall Sr.," Why aren't you firing randomly into those birds, little lady? Don't you wanna help 'em?
",89,37,3,5,Hunter #2,Leela8194,Leela," Not this way.
",15,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8195,Waterfall Sr.," What? Why you're not a tree-hugging kook at all!
",50,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8196,Leela," Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not. But I do know the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who just wanna kill for fun.
",167,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8197,Waterfall Sr.," Leela, you may just be farming some free-range truth there.  On the other hand, we already made up 200 pounds of batter for penguin tempura. OK, boys, it's them or us!
",169,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8198,Leela," No!
",5,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Waterfall Sr.8199,Waterfall Sr.," Hey! Where'd they--
",21,37,3,5,Leela,Bender8200,Bender,"  Attack!
",10,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Hunter #18201,Hunter #1," Whoa!
",7,37,3,5,Bender,Hunter #28202,Hunter #2," Ow!
",5,37,3,5,Hunter #1,Bender8203,Bender,"  We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!
",73,37,3,5,Hunter #2,Waterfall Sr.8204,Waterfall Sr.,"  Make sure they use every part of my body!
",44,37,3,5,Bender,Old Man #1 Waterfall8205,Old Man #1 Waterfall,"  I'll avenge your death, son!
",31,37,3,5,Waterfall Sr.,Leela8206,Leela," They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.
",69,37,3,5,Old Man #1 Waterfall,Bender8207,Bender," Yep. It's like I taught 'em: If it ain't black and white, peck scratch and bite! Now to take off my tuxedo.  Guys, it's me! Your lovable dictator! Uh-oh!
",155,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8208,Leela," Oh, if only we had a toboggan.
",32,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8209,Bender," Faster! Faster!
",17,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8210,Leela," Phew!
",7,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8211,Bender," Oh, phew!  Oh, right, they can swim. It's all coming back to me now.
",70,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8212,Leela," It's Fry!
",11,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8213,Bender," Wiggles?
",10,37,3,5,Leela,Leela8214,Leela," Well, at least it'll help reduce their population.
",52,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8215,Bender," Yeah, life is hilariously cruel.  Permission to come aboard, Wiggles?
",71,37,3,5,Leela,Fry8216,Fry," Granted. We can't take off without our captain.
",49,37,3,5,Bender,Bender8217,Bender," Oh, and bring my toboggan.
",28,37,3,5,Fry,Fry8218,Fry," So, Leela, were you able to help the penguins?
",48,37,3,5,Bender,Leela8219,Leela," Well, sure. I mean ... not really. I mean ... nature will work itself out. It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things, right?
",152,37,3,5,Fry,Fry8220,Fry,"  I 'unno.
",11,37,3,5,Leela,Bender8221,Bender," Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birds'll do just fine.
",92,37,3,5,Fry,Leela8222,Leela," Guidance system?
",18,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8223,Bender," Online.
",9,38,3,6,Leela,Leela8224,Leela," Autopilot?
",12,38,3,6,Bender,Autopilot8225,Autopilot," Present.
",10,38,3,6,Leela,Leela8226,Leela," Dark matter indicator?
",24,38,3,6,Autopilot,Fry8227,Fry," Making the noise.
",19,38,3,6,Leela,Leela8228,Leela," All systems operational. Let's rock!
",38,38,3,6,Fry,Leela8229,Leela," Gentlemen, I've completed my report on the crash.
",51,38,3,6,Leela,Bender8230,Bender," Whoa! I'm not reading that crap. Summarise it in one word.
",60,38,3,6,Leela,Leela8231,Leela," Sabotage.  This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is but the fevered dream of a madman.
",100,38,3,6,Bender,Fry8232,Fry," Yep.
",6,38,3,6,Leela,Bender8233,Bender," Of course.
",12,38,3,6,Fry,Zoidberg8234,Zoidberg," Doy!
",6,38,3,6,Bender,Hermes8235,Hermes," It's an important unit.
",25,38,3,6,Zoidberg,Leela8236,Leela," And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship.
",67,38,3,6,Hermes,Fry8237,Fry," That doesn't look like an ""L"" at all. Unless you count lowercase.
",67,38,3,6,Leela,Bender8238,Bender," You know we don't!
",20,38,3,6,Fry,Leela8239,Leela," Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.
",71,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8240,Bender," Hmm. It should look like this.  But instead it looks like this.
",65,38,3,6,Leela,Fry8241,Fry," Who would do a thing like that?
",33,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8242,Bender," Who could do a thing like that? And by ""that"", I mean this.
",61,38,3,6,Fry,Zoidberg8243,Zoidberg," Well, gang, it looks like we have another mystery on our hands.
",65,38,3,6,Bender,Hermes8244,Hermes," I'd better make a chart of the suspects. I'll begin by drawing a line with my straight-edge.  Sweet lamprey of Santa Fe! My edge has been bent!
",145,38,3,6,Zoidberg,Amy8245,Amy,"  My javelin too! It's ruined.  Now we'll never beat Jupiter State.
",68,38,3,6,Hermes,Zoidberg8246,Zoidberg," My slinky!  My cuddly, little pet slinky!
",43,38,3,6,Amy,Farnsworth8247,Farnsworth," What's all the hubbub?
",24,38,3,6,Zoidberg,Leela8248,Leela," My God! Even the Professor's been bent.
",41,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth8249,Farnsworth," That you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum.
",57,38,3,6,Leela,Bender8250,Bender," I'll get you fixed up.  That's fine.
",38,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Amy8251,Amy," Wait a minute. Bender, what did you just do to the Professor?
",63,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8252,Bender," I bent him.
",13,38,3,6,Amy,Amy8253,Amy," Aha!
",6,38,3,6,Bender,Hermes8254,Hermes," Bender!
",9,38,3,6,Amy,Zoidberg8255,Zoidberg," J'accuse!
",11,38,3,6,Hermes,Bender8256,Bender," Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending.
",85,38,3,6,Zoidberg,Hermes8257,Hermes," I know how to settle this: We'll check last night's surveillance tapes.
",73,38,3,6,Bender,Fry8258,Fry," Huh?
",6,38,3,6,Hermes,Amy8259,Amy," What tapes?
",13,38,3,6,Fry,Leela8260,Leela," Surveillance?
",15,38,3,6,Amy,Zoidberg8261,Zoidberg," You've seen me naked?
",23,38,3,6,Leela,Hermes8262,Hermes," Ah. Last night's tape. It was right next to Bathroom Bloopers 4.
",66,38,3,6,Zoidberg,Bender8263,Bender," See? Nothing. Told you, losers.
",33,38,3,6,Hermes,Fry8264,Fry," Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are.
",51,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8265,Bender," I'm sleepwalking.
",19,38,3,6,Fry,Farnsworth8266,Farnsworth," Dear God! We've got robots on the ceiling.
",44,38,3,6,Bender,Fry8267,Fry," You weren't sleepwalking, you were sleep-bending!
",51,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Bender8268,Bender," This is quite a shock. On the other hand, it's not surprising in the least. After all, I've been bending since the day I was built.
",133,38,3,6,Fry,Bender8269,Bender,"  I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.
",61,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8270,Bender," Mama.  Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending.
",98,38,3,6,Bender,Amy8271,Amy," You remember your own birth?
",30,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8272,Bender," Sure. It was only four years ago.
",35,38,3,6,Amy,Fry8273,Fry," You're only four years old?
",29,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8274,Bender," Precocious little scamp, ain't I?
",35,38,3,6,Fry,Leela8275,Leela," Hmm. Bender must have a pent-up need to bend that's not being satisfied by his bend-free lifestyle.
",101,38,3,6,Bender,Farnsworth8276,Farnsworth," Then he can't stay here. He's a menace to every straight person in the company.  Go satisfy your bend lust and don't you come back to work until you do.
",154,38,3,6,Leela,Robot #1s8277,Robot #1s,"  No more bending, no more work. Give us a raise, you big fat jerk.
",68,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Sal8278,Sal,"  Nevers!
",10,38,3,6,Robot #1s,Joey8279,Joey," Yo! The Mafia supports you. But don't tell no one. Spread the word.
",69,38,3,6,Sal,Donbot8280,Donbot," As the duly-elected mobsters of this union, it's our duty to support the struggle of these proud, lazy slobs.
",111,38,3,6,Joey,Joey8281,Joey," Yeah, but what if management remains intragnizent?
",52,38,3,6,Donbot,Donbot8282,Donbot," From the context it is clear what you mean. In that case, Clamps may have a little surprise for them.
",103,38,3,6,Joey,Clamps8283,Clamps," The clamps!   Right?
",22,38,3,6,Donbot,Bender8284,Bender," Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything. Oh, woe is Bender.
",75,38,3,6,Clamps,Robot #1 #18285,Robot #1 #1," Hang tough, brother. Management refused our demand to switch casual Friday to Monday.
",87,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8286,Bender," What?
",7,38,3,6,Robot #1 #1,Robot #1 #28287,Robot #1 #2," And now they're hiring scabs at ten-times the normal wage.
",60,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8288,Bender," Ten-times normal wage?  I'll give those jerks what for!
",57,38,3,6,Robot #1 #2,Sal8289,Sal," Welcomes aboard, scab.
",24,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8290,Bender," Great to be here.
",19,38,3,6,Sal,Sal8291,Sal," Come on. I'll introduces you to your scab co-workers you'll be scabbing with.  This here's our scab foreman.
",110,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8292,Bender," Flexo?
",8,38,3,6,Sal,Flexo8293,Flexo," Bender?
",9,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8294,Bender," Hey, sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account of mistaken identity.
",110,38,3,6,Flexo,Flexo8295,Flexo," You bastard! They treated me like an animal and that's what I became!  Nah, you're alright. Good to see you, buddy!
",117,38,3,6,Bender,Sal8296,Sal," And here's another scab what also works here, Angle-ine.
",58,38,3,6,Flexo,Bender8297,Bender,"  Hello.
",9,38,3,6,Sal,Sal8298,Sal," Hey, yous guyses wanna move that things?
",42,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8299,Bender,"  Hello!
",9,38,3,6,Sal,Robot #1s8300,Robot #1s,"  Give us a raise, you big fat jerk.
",37,38,3,6,Bender,Sal8301,Sal,"  Nevers!
",10,38,3,6,Robot #1s,Bender8302,Bender," Ow!  Um, hi, Angle-ine. Whatcha up to?
",40,38,3,6,Sal,Angle-ine8303,Angle-ine," Making hangers. Guidance counsellor said I had a knack for it.
",64,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8304,Bender," That's cool, that's cool. So, um, uh, I was wondering if, y'know, it's cool if not, but, what are you doing after work?
",121,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8305,Angle-ine," What I always do. Jack squat.
",31,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8306,Bender," Me too.  Man, we have a lot in common, huh?
",45,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8307,Angle-ine," Well we are made of virtually identical components.
",53,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8308,Bender,"  Are you sure? Maybe I should sneak a peek at your access panel.
",66,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8309,Angle-ine," Hey, according to the scab handbook that's extremely inappropriate banter.  And that's just the way I like it.
",112,38,3,6,Bender,Hermes8310,Hermes," Haile H. Selassie!
",20,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Zoidberg8311,Zoidberg," There, little friend. Good as new.
",36,38,3,6,Hermes,Farnsworth8312,Farnsworth," What an exquisite day. That azure sky, the verdant treetops.  Those delightful birds with their chirp, chirp, chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat.
",148,38,3,6,Zoidberg,Fry8313,Fry," Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?
",77,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth8314,Farnsworth," Hmm. I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain, resulting in a mild delirium. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.
",255,38,3,6,Fry,Fry8315,Fry," I wish! It's a nickel.
",24,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Bender8316,Bender," Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera!
",68,38,3,6,Fry,Bender8317,Bender," I bet watching me bend girders like this turns your legs all rubbery.
",71,38,3,6,Bender,Angle-ine8318,Angle-ine," Well my legs are made of rubber.  And anyway, I am just as strong as you are, Mac.
",84,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8319,Bender," Oh, yeah?  Prove it.  Here, let me help you.
",46,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Farnsworth8320,Farnsworth," My new bent outlook has completely re-energised me. I'm even dating a young Brazilian retired actress.
",104,38,3,6,Bender,Fry8321,Fry," Alright!
",10,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth8322,Farnsworth," Some say I'm robbing the cradle but I say she's robbing the grave.
",68,38,3,6,Fry,Bender8323,Bender," Howdy, doodies. What's new?
",29,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth8324,Farnsworth," I was just regaling your former co-workers with a tale of bedroom antics, the likes of which--
",96,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8325,Bender," Yeah, yeah! Big whoop! No one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm in love and I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate.
",125,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Amy8326,Amy," Let's get liquored up!
",24,38,3,6,Bender,Elzar8327,Elzar," Hey, look at this crowd. You guys gotta try the pasta. It's got a real nice profit margin. Bam! So, special occasion tonight?
",127,38,3,6,Amy,Bender8328,Bender," Oh, Elzar, you'll never guess what's happened?
",48,38,3,6,Elzar,Elzar8329,Elzar," Bam?
",6,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8330,Bender," I met the most dynamite ladybot.
",34,38,3,6,Elzar,Elzar8331,Elzar," Hey, that's terrific. To celebrate, I'm gonna stick seven copies of my latest cookbook on your bill.
",102,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8332,Bender," Bless you, sir.
",17,38,3,6,Elzar,Farnsworth8333,Farnsworth," So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours.
",57,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8334,Bender," I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast.  To Angle-ine, she's got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot.
",137,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Fry8335,Fry," She sure does.
",16,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8336,Bender," Flexo!
",8,38,3,6,Fry,Elzar8337,Elzar,"  Careful, that's a week old!
",30,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8338,Bender," I finally meet a nice girl with a pair of legs that don't quit unexpectedly and that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, metal ass.  You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angle-ine.
",218,38,3,6,Elzar,Angle-ine8339,Angle-ine," Bender, it's-it's not what you think.
",39,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8340,Bender," Oh, God! Then it's worse than I think.
",40,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8341,Angle-ine," Now, look, there is no reason to be upset. Flexo and I are divorced.
",70,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8342,Bender," Div-- Huh?
",12,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Flexo8343,Flexo," We're just havin' dinner 'cause we wanna stay friends.
",56,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8344,Bender," Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine. Really, it's the steward's fault.
",106,38,3,6,Flexo,Steward8345,Steward," Excellent choice, sir.
",24,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8346,Bender,"  That Flexo, I'm knockin' him right on his butt. I can't believe this.
",72,38,3,6,Steward,Farnsworth8347,Farnsworth," Obsessing won't help, Bender. Take a lean back and enjoy life.
",64,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8348,Bender," I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot.
",56,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Leela8349,Leela," Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest way.
",74,38,3,6,Bender,Fry8350,Fry," Yeah. Either that or be a man.
",32,38,3,6,Leela,Bender8351,Bender," OK, I've constructed an elaborate lie: I'll call Angle-ine while pretending to be Flexo, arrange a date, show up disguised as him and catch her two-timing me with myself.
",172,38,3,6,Fry,Fry8352,Fry," That's thinkin' like a man.
",29,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8353,Bender,"  Hello? This is Flexo.
",24,38,3,6,Fry,Bender8354,Bender," Now we'll see who loves whom.
",31,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8355,Bender," Hey, hot stuff.
",17,38,3,6,Bender,Angle-ine8356,Angle-ine," Hey, Flexo.  So since when do you go to bars on work nights? It's not like you at all.
",88,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8357,Bender," Nonsense. It's exactly like me. Flexo: The fun-loving love machine Fembots love to love. Hey, barkeep, I'll have a Fuzzy Navel and she'll have the girliest drink in the house.
",177,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Bartender-bot8358,Bartender-bot," Two Fuzzy Navel's comin' up.
",30,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8359,Bender," I hope they can make change for a fortune.
",44,38,3,6,Bartender-bot,Joey8360,Joey," Yo. Get an eye-load of that filthy scab with the beard flashing his filthy scab money. It's an insult to you, boss.
",117,38,3,6,Bender,Donbot8361,Donbot," Yeah. That cash oughta be slushin' my fund and kicksing my back.
",66,38,3,6,Joey,Clamps8362,Clamps," I'm greasing up my whoozits!
",30,38,3,6,Donbot,Donbot8363,Donbot," Whoa, whoa, Clamps, not yet. Let's just keep an eye on him and see if he does it a couple more times.
",103,38,3,6,Clamps,Bender8364,Bender," You're lookin' good to Flexo tonight.
",39,38,3,6,Donbot,Angle-ine8365,Angle-ine," Quit makin' with the googly eyes. You know that I'm in love with Bender.
",74,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8366,Bender," Bender? That walking wuss factory?
",36,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8367,Angle-ine," Well he may be a walking factory but believe me he is no wuss. Now, look, you and me are through. I told you that when I divorced you.
",136,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8368,Bender," But going through a divorce together, you can't tell me that didn't bring us closer. Care to dance?
",101,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8369,Angle-ine," You know I love dancing but you always hated it.
",50,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8370,Bender," In that case it's something I've always wanted to make up to you.  Hey, scratchmo. How 'bout dropping me and the lady some rump-rattling beats?
",145,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Donbot8371,Donbot," I had hoped that by the second time he flashed his cash my rage would have subsided. Sadly that has not happened.
",115,38,3,6,Bender,Angle-ine8372,Angle-ine," You used to be so inflexible, Flexo. You have really loosened up!
",67,38,3,6,Donbot,Bender8373,Bender," I recently upgraded my funk card. C'mon!
",42,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8374,Angle-ine," Alright!
",10,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8375,Bender," C'mon now, what's new!  Ew!
",29,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8376,Angle-ine," Flexo? What-What's going on?
",30,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8377,Bender," Um...
",7,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8378,Angle-ine," Flexo!
",8,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8379,Bender," So the moral of the story is: If you want it to stay sunk, tie a weight to it!
",80,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8380,Angle-ine,"  You always were a kick in the teeth, man.
",44,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8381,Bender," Aw, shucks, thunder-buns! You make me feel like a million volts.
",66,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8382,Angle-ine," Flexo, Flexo, Flexo. I'm starting to remember why I fell for you in the first place.
",86,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8383,Bender,"  So, she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a little more, just to be sure.
",89,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8384,Angle-ine," Well, it's late. I should get home to my trailer.
",51,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8385,Bender," I'll walk you out. After all, a true gentleman tends to his date's every need.  Tiparillo?
",92,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Bender8386,Bender," Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way possible.
",79,38,3,6,Bender,Joey8387,Joey," He's flashin' his cash loaf again.
",36,38,3,6,Bender,Donbot8388,Donbot," How many times is that? Two or three?
",39,38,3,6,Joey,Clamps8389,Clamps," Three.
",8,38,3,6,Donbot,Donbot8390,Donbot," Alright. That's the necessary number of times. That scab's gonna have a little on-the-job accident.
",101,38,3,6,Clamps,Joey8391,Joey," With all due respect, Donbot, I don't think we should rely on an accident happening. Let's kill him ourselves.
",112,38,3,6,Donbot,Angle-ine8392,Angle-ine," Well, goodnight. I-I had a great time.
",40,38,3,6,Joey,Bender8393,Bender," How 'bout a lift? To your place.
",34,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8394,Angle-ine," What?
",7,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8395,Bender," Admit it. You felt something for me tonight. And by ""me"" I mean Flexo.
",72,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8396,Angle-ine," Hey, look, I had fun, but--
",29,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8397,Bender," But?
",6,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8398,Angle-ine," But--
",7,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8399,Bender," But?
",6,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8400,Angle-ine,"  But...  Huh? Bender! You tricked me.
",39,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8401,Bender," That's right, baby. I ain't your lover boy, Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anybody pretending to be him.
",122,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8402,Angle-ine," Well maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you're pretending to be.
",81,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8403,Bender," Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: Kill Flexo.  Ow!
",119,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8404,Angle-ine,"  Nooo!
",8,38,3,6,Bender,Flexo8405,Flexo," Thanks, I appreciate that.  Nah, I'm joshing you. That was quite annoying.
",76,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Bender8406,Bender," You call yourself divorced? You're making a mockery of one of our oldest institutions.
",88,38,3,6,Flexo,Flexo8407,Flexo," What?
",7,38,3,6,Bender,Clamps8408,Clamps," Alright, boss, give the word and I'll drop this unbendable girder. Clamp, clamp, ka-bamp!
",91,38,3,6,Flexo,Donbot8409,Donbot," Remember, only kill the one with the beard. That other filthy scab we got nothing against.
",92,38,3,6,Clamps,Flexo8410,Flexo," That's low!
",13,38,3,6,Donbot,Angle-ine8411,Angle-ine," Please stop! I'm not worth it!
",32,38,3,6,Flexo,Bender8412,Bender," Probably not. But I love you and I'm gonna kick his ass till I win you back.
",78,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Donbot8413,Donbot,"  OK, Clamps. Now!
",19,38,3,6,Bender,Clamps8414,Clamps," Ooh, that's gotta clamp!
",26,38,3,6,Donbot,Angle-ine8415,Angle-ine," Flexo? Are you OK?
",20,38,3,6,Clamps,Flexo8416,Flexo," Yeah, never better.  Nah, I'm yankin' your chain, I'm dying.
",62,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8417,Angle-ine," You can't die. Tonight Bender showed me that I love you.
",58,38,3,6,Flexo,Bender8418,Bender," But, I love you.
",18,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8419,Angle-ine," I know and I care for you too. But I could never love anyone as much as you made me realise I love Flexo.
",107,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8420,Bender," But ... but...  I love you so much, Angle-ine, I want you to be happy no matter what.
",87,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8421,Angle-ine," What, what are you saying?
",28,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8422,Bender," I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder to bend.
",51,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Angle-ine8423,Angle-ine," You can't bend that girder. It's unbendable!
",46,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8424,Bender," Well I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the one option.
",82,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Flexo8425,Flexo," Thanks, buddy. Another year under that and I'd have been a goner.
",67,38,3,6,Bender,Angle-ine8426,Angle-ine," I'll always remember this, Bender.
",36,38,3,6,Flexo,Bender8427,Bender,"  Me too. Me too.  Jerk.
",25,38,3,6,Angle-ine,Leela8428,Leela," So Flexo and Angle-ine had sex right there on the factory floor? Well, at least you got bending out of your system.
",117,38,3,6,Bender,Bender8429,Bender," Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time.
",60,38,3,6,Leela,Farnsworth8430,Farnsworth," Perhaps it's your outlook that needs a good bend. A 90-degree bend to a place where happiness is perpendicular to wonderment.
",127,38,3,6,Bender,Fry8431,Fry," Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat attitude.
",52,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Amy8432,Amy," I'll say.
",11,38,3,6,Fry,Zoidberg8433,Zoidberg," Believe it.
",13,38,3,6,Amy,Farnsworth8434,Farnsworth," Nonsense. It's just like in the song I wrote:
 We all need a new angle on life,
You gotta bend away all your trouble and your strife,
",135,38,3,6,Zoidberg,Leela8435,Leela," Bender, you've gotta help us.
",31,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Bender8436,Bender," I try to get out but they keep pulling me back in.
",52,38,3,6,Leela,Farnsworth8437,Farnsworth,"  You gotta dangle,
Have a new angle,
Wangle a new dangle on life,
",67,38,3,6,Bender,Amy8438,Amy," No, Bender! The other way.
",28,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Bender8439,Bender," I like him better this way.
",29,38,3,6,Amy,Farnsworth8440,Farnsworth," I'm sad now.
",14,38,3,6,Bender,Leela8441,Leela," Eh, it's fine.
",16,38,3,6,Farnsworth,Amy8442,Amy," Is Nibbler stoked for the big pet show?
",41,39,3,7,Leela,Leela8443,Leela," He ought to be with all the strict training I've been putting him through.  Nibbler, roll over and you get a ham.  Roll over. Roll over for the ham.  You are so adorable! Who wants a ham?
",189,39,3,7,Amy,Farnsworth8444,Farnsworth," Zooka barooka! First prize is $500 and a year's supply of dog food!
",69,39,3,7,Leela,Bender8445,Bender," ""$500"", you say?
",18,39,3,7,Farnsworth,Zoidberg8446,Zoidberg," ""Dog food"", you say?
",22,39,3,7,Bender,Fry8447,Fry," Man, that's dog's gonna be hard to beat. Look at him bring in the sheep! One sheep, two sheep ...  ... three sheep.
",117,39,3,7,Zoidberg,Leela8448,Leela," The dog's good, but our real competition is the Hypno-Toad.  Your turn, Nibbler, honey. Herd those sheep!
",107,39,3,7,Fry,Amy8449,Amy," Come on, Nibbler!
",19,39,3,7,Leela,Bender8450,Bender,"  Ma'am, I have a late entry: My hard-shelled wooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg.
",77,39,3,7,Amy,Bender8451,Bender," Faster! Faster.
",17,39,3,7,Bender,Zoidberg8452,Zoidberg," Ow!
",5,39,3,7,Bender,Bender8453,Bender," Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed?
",40,39,3,7,Zoidberg,Bender8454,Bender," Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!
",42,39,3,7,Bender,Bender8455,Bender," I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!
",39,39,3,7,Bender,Fry8456,Fry," I love these things!
",22,39,3,7,Bender,Leela8457,Leela," Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake.  He might be a little hungry. Shake, boy. Usually he's had more ham by now. Shake!
",121,39,3,7,Fry,Judge #1 #18458,Judge #1 #1," Third prize, a party-sized keg of guinea pigs, goes to Dave Spiegel and his owner, Fluffers.  Second prize, this lovely afghan made from an Afghan, goes to Bender and his wooping terrier.
",189,39,3,7,Leela,Bender8459,Bender," Second place?  That's a fancy word for losing.  You didn't stick your landing!
",80,39,3,7,Judge #1 #1,Zoidberg8460,Zoidberg," Forgive me, my friend.
",24,39,3,7,Bender,Bender8461,Bender," Never!
",8,39,3,7,Zoidberg,Judge #1 #18462,Judge #1 #1," And before we announce the winner we have a special award for a first-time contestant: Ms. Leela and her mystery pet, Nibbler!
",128,39,3,7,Bender,Leela8463,Leela," Me? Award? Him? Me? Good?
",27,39,3,7,Judge #1 #1,Judge #1 #18464,Judge #1 #1," That's just the kind of eloquence you'd expect from the owner of Dumbest Pet in Show.  And the grand prize winner ...   ... the Hypno-Toad.  All glory to the Hypno-Toad.
",171,39,3,7,Leela,Leela8465,Leela," Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb.
",45,39,3,7,Judge #1 #1,Fry8466,Fry," Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them.
",73,39,3,7,Leela,Farnsworth8467,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 12 but it's been completely destroyed.
",119,39,3,7,Fry,Leela8468,Leela," Why is that good news?
",24,39,3,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth8469,Farnsworth," They paid in advance.
",23,39,3,7,Leela,Bender8470,Bender," Excuse me.
",12,39,3,7,Farnsworth,Hermes8471,Hermes," This is mighty strange.  First, the civilisation of Space Rome collapsed, then Don Martin 3 went kaflooie and now Tweenis 12.
",127,39,3,7,Bender,Fry8472,Fry,"  Looks like this planet is next in line.
",42,39,3,7,Hermes,Leela8473,Leela," That's Earth.  The planet we live on.
",39,39,3,7,Fry,Fry8474,Fry," I'd hate to be those guys.
",28,39,3,7,Leela,Hermes8475,Hermes," What's got into him? He's twitching like Zoidberg when someone mentions the word ""food"".
",90,39,3,7,Fry,Zoidberg8476,Zoidberg,"  What, now?
",13,39,3,7,Hermes,Leela8477,Leela,"  No! Nibbler, come back!
",26,39,3,7,Zoidberg,Leela8478,Leela," Too bad Nibbler's not around. I guess I'll have to eat this raw, dripping ham by myself.  Nibbler?  Nibbler, you're scaring me.  Nibbler?  Am I going crazy? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me?   Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here.  Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little bit?
",316,39,3,7,Leela,Fry8479,Fry," Leela back yet?
",17,39,3,7,Leela,Bender8480,Bender," Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!
",41,39,3,7,Fry,Fry8481,Fry," You don't have a heart; you're a robot.
",41,39,3,7,Bender,Bender8482,Bender," Sure ... right. Robot!  Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky.
",64,39,3,7,Fry,Fry8483,Fry," Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal.
",39,39,3,7,Bender,Bender8484,Bender," Am I a robot?
",15,39,3,7,Fry,Fry8485,Fry," Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney.
",94,39,3,7,Bender,Bender8486,Bender," Fry!  My skin!
",16,39,3,7,Fry,Farnsworth8487,Farnsworth," Ow. Ow. Ow.  I'm a genius. Ow. Ow.
",36,39,3,7,Bender,Fry8488,Fry," Dr. Zoidberg, why is everyone acting so weird?
",48,39,3,7,Farnsworth,Zoidberg8489,Zoidberg," Zoidy want balloon! Want balloon now!  Zoidy want go outside!
",63,39,3,7,Fry,Fry8490,Fry,"  I just let you back in!
",26,39,3,7,Zoidberg,Leela8491,Leela," This is unbelievable. I thought you were a furry little moron. But here you are flying an adorable spaceship. If only you could talk.  Wait! I understood that!  You say you're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain.  You say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid?  Oh, stupider. And you go on to say that we're headed for your home planet where your race has lived since the beginning of the universe?  So, how did the universe begin?  Then the meaning of existence--  So every religion is wrong!
",531,39,3,7,Fry,Linda8492,Linda,"  You fell!  Hi! Today some bad things happened. One bad thing was a train got crashed in New Jersey. Wanna see?  People won't be late for work though, because the governor lady said,  ""I'm sending in more trains!""
",215,39,3,7,Leela,Woman #18493,Woman #1,"  Go!
",6,39,3,7,Linda,Man #18494,Man #1,"  Wait for me! Wait for me!
",28,39,3,7,Woman #1,Morbo8495,Morbo,"  Morbo can't understand his TelePrompTer. He forgot how you say that letter that looks like a man with a hat.
",111,39,3,7,Man #1,Linda8496,Linda,"  It's a ""T"". It goes ""tuh"".
",29,39,3,7,Morbo,Morbo8497,Morbo,"  Hello, little man. I will destroy you!
",41,39,3,7,Linda,Fry8498,Fry," Man, even the news monster is acting strange. What are we gonna do?
",69,39,3,7,Morbo,Farnsworth8499,Farnsworth," Duh, I know! Let's play the lottery!
",38,39,3,7,Fry,Amy8500,Amy," No. Let's buy Internet stock!
",31,39,3,7,Farnsworth,Zoidberg8501,Zoidberg," On margin! Zoidy wanna buy on margin!
",39,39,3,7,Amy,Hermes8502,Hermes," Look at me! I'm invisible!
",28,39,3,7,Zoidberg,Fry8503,Fry," Wait a minute! I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots!
",71,39,3,7,Hermes,Bender8504,Bender," Hey, let's all join the Reform Party!
",39,39,3,7,Fry,Hermes8505,Hermes," Oh, yeah!
",11,39,3,7,Bender,Ken8506,Ken," Welcome back, Lord Nibbler, Ambassador to Earth, homeworld of the pizza bagel.
",80,39,3,7,Hermes,Nibbler8507,Nibbler," Thank you. I bear many receipts for reimbursement.
",52,39,3,7,Ken,Fiona8508,Fiona," The four welcomes of friendship to you as well, Leela. We shall manipulate your mind so we appear to be speaking your language. Do not be afraid, my child.
",157,39,3,7,Nibbler,Leela8509,Leela," I'm not afraid.
",17,39,3,7,Fiona,Fiona8510,Fiona," Uh, good. Good.
",17,39,3,7,Leela,Leela8511,Leela," So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? That's a coincidence.
",59,39,3,7,Fiona,Nibbler8512,Nibbler," That name is for your sake. In the time it would take to pronounce one letter of my true name, a trillion cosmoses would flair into existence and sink into eternal night.
",172,39,3,7,Leela,Leela8513,Leela," Oh, you're all so cute!
",25,39,3,7,Nibbler,Ken8514,Ken," No, we're not.  We Nibblonians are an ancient and powerful race. Behold.  When the universe was forged in the crucible of the Big Bang, our mighty race was already 17 years old.
",179,39,3,7,Leela,Leela8515,Leela," Aww!
",6,39,3,7,Ken,Ken8516,Ken," For the first millisecond of time, things were OK. But then there arose a terrible enemy: The Brain Spawn.  Ever since, we have waged unceasing war against these dreadful--
",174,39,3,7,Leela,Nibblonian Chef8517,Nibblonian Chef," Lunch is ready.
",17,39,3,7,Ken,Ken8518,Ken," Then let the feast of a thousand hams begin.
",46,39,3,7,Nibblonian Chef,Leela8519,Leela," So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth, Nibbler?
",56,39,3,7,Ken,Nibbler8520,Nibbler," The Brain Spawn hate all consciousness. The thoughts of others screech at them like the forced laughs of a billion art house movie patrons.
",141,39,3,7,Leela,Ken8521,Ken," Thus, they travel from world to world making everyone stupid in order to wipe out all thought in the universe.
",112,39,3,7,Nibbler,Leela8522,Leela," Wipe out all thought? My God! They're like flying televisions.
",64,39,3,7,Ken,Fiona8523,Fiona," And even we are powerless to stop them, fearsome though we are.
",65,39,3,7,Leela,Nibbler8524,Nibbler," There is but one being who can resist them. A child of destiny whose bizarre brain wave pattern makes him immune to the Brain Spawn attack.  He is the hope of the universe.  The fate of your world, perhaps all worlds, rests in his special mind.
",246,39,3,7,Fiona,Leela8525,Leela," Now, when you say ""special""...
",32,39,3,7,Nibbler,Fry8526,Fry," Attention, New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!
",52,39,3,7,Leela,Ken8527,Ken,"  Nibblonian fleet holding at perimeter of moron zone, formerly known as ""Earth"".
",82,39,3,7,Fry,Leela8528,Leela," Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains? Because he doesn't shower?
",74,39,3,7,Ken,Fiona8529,Fiona," The Brain Spawn suppress intelligence by attacking the delta brain wave. Every animal and robot in the universe generates this wave, as do certain trees.
",155,39,3,7,Leela,Nibbler8530,Nibbler," Fry, however, does not.
",25,39,3,7,Fiona,Fiona8531,Fiona," Somehow he has cobbled together a random assortment of other brain waves into a working mind.
",95,39,3,7,Nibbler,Leela8532,Leela," Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants.
",46,39,3,7,Fiona,Nibbler8533,Nibbler," Yes, like your prom dress.
",28,39,3,7,Leela,Ken8534,Ken," The Brain Spawn are commanded by a giant, evil brain with a gooey centre of pure hate.
",88,39,3,7,Nibbler,Fiona8535,Fiona," Only Fry, with his superior, yet inferior mind, can approach him. You must tell him to disable it. We will do the rest.
",121,39,3,7,Ken,Leela8536,Leela," You can count on me.
",22,39,3,7,Fiona,Fiona8537,Fiona," No, we can't. Once on Earth, you will be too stupid to remember the message.
",78,39,3,7,Leela,Nibbler8538,Nibbler," That's why we wrote it down for you.
",38,39,3,7,Fiona,Ken8539,Ken," We've also prepared a bag lunch and some mittens.
",51,39,3,7,Nibbler,Fry8540,Fry," Time to re-educate you dunce-bags. We'll start with US presidents.  This was our first president, George Washington.  Let's review. Who was our first president?
",162,39,3,7,Ken,Amy8541,Amy," Um.

",49,39,3,7,Leela,Leela8556,Leela,"  I 'unno!
",11,39,3,7,Fry,Fry8557,Fry," Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be?  The libary!
",92,39,3,7,Leela,Big Brain8558,Big Brain," Pathetic human race. Arranging their knowledge by category just made it easier to absorb. Dewey, you fool, your decimal system has played right into my hands!  What do you want?
",179,39,3,7,Fry,Fry8559,Fry," I'm here to kick your ass.
",28,39,3,7,Big Brain,Big Brain8560,Big Brain," Wishful thinking. We have long since evolved beyond the need for asses.  Odd. My stupefaction field is having no effect on your ability to think.
",147,39,3,7,Fry,Fry8561,Fry," That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing!  OK, better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think!  Thinking ... thinking...
",165,39,3,7,Big Brain,Big Brain8562,Big Brain," Oh! Stop that!
",16,39,3,7,Fry,Fry8563,Fry," Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that.  Aha! Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic.
",122,39,3,7,Big Brain,Leela8564,Leela," Duh...
",8,39,3,7,Fry,Fry8565,Fry," Seriously, I can't think of anything.  Gotta find something to make me think. Hardy Boys, too easy. Nancy Drew, too hard. Aha! Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!

",54,39,3,7,Fry,Big Brain8583,Big Brain," Tom Sawyer, you tricked me. This is less fun than previously indicated. Let this corny slice of Americana be your tomb for all eternity.

",34,39,3,7,Fry,Fry8601,Fry,"  Leela cried for her lost love as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase. The Big Brain laughed in triumph...  Then, for no reason, he left Earth forever. The end.  There!  Now he's trapped in a book I wrote; a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors.
",259,39,3,7,Leela,Big Brain8602,Big Brain," The Big Brain am winning again. I am the greetest!  Now I am leaving Earth for no raeson!

",54,39,3,7,Nibbler,Fry8605,Fry,"  I did it!  And it's all thanks to the books at my local library.
",67,39,3,7,Leela,Nibbler8606,Nibbler,"  And so life returned to normal, or as normal as it gets on this primitive dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes.
",114,39,3,7,Fry,Nibbler8607,Nibbler,"  Thanks to the effect of the brain rays, the people of Earth had no memory of what had transpired, except Fry, and no one believed him or cared what he had to say.
",165,39,3,7,Nibbler,Nibbler8608,Nibbler,"  I, meanwhile, returned to my post, ever vigilant, lest Earth again come under Brain attack. And when that day comes, God help us. God help us all.

",75,40,3,8,Woman #1 #1,Zoidberg8621,Zoidberg," My whole life I worked on that act. And they hated it.
",56,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Hermes8622,Hermes," You're a crazy, penniless, lobster doctor. No combination of you should be a comedian.
",88,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8623,Zoidberg," But comedy is in my valves. My Uncle Harold was a big Hollywood star back in the era of silent holograms.
",107,40,3,8,Hermes,Leela8624,Leela," Your uncle was Harold Zoid?
",29,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8625,Zoidberg," This I cannot deny.
",21,40,3,8,Leela,Farnsworth8626,Farnsworth," Why, I've been a Harold Zoid fan since back when my hips were made of bone. As it happens, I still have some of my original 78s.
",130,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Hermes8627,Hermes," You're right, crabby. He's a hell of a lot funnier than you could ever be.
",76,40,3,8,Farnsworth,Zoidberg8628,Zoidberg," Maybe so, but perhaps if I wrote him and asked for a few hundred pointers...
",78,40,3,8,Hermes,Zoidberg8629,Zoidberg," This letter has to be very personal, so I'm writing it in my own ink.   Dear Uncle Zoid, greetings from your long-lost nephew. Norm and Sam and Sadie's boy, remember?
",168,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8630,Zoidberg,"  Now I am the most important doctor at the delivery company where I work. But, sadly, my life is bereft of laughter.
",118,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoid8631,Zoid,"  I beg of you, Mr. Funny Uncle, teach me the comedy business. Sincerely, Zoidberg.  Oy, isn't that nice? He took the time.
",124,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Woman #1 #28632,Woman #1 #2," What's that scribbledy-gook?
",30,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8633,Zoid," This is a fan letter from my rich doctor nephew, who just might be my ticket out of this flophouse, he might.  Yeah, you'd better run.  Dear Rich Doctor Nephew, I can help you be funny. The first funny thing you must do is put all your money in the form of a cashier's check and come to Hollywood.
",299,40,3,8,Woman #1 #2,Zoidberg8634,Zoidberg,"  Sincerely, Harold Zoid. P.S. Cashier's check.  Did you hear that? I'm going to Hollywood!
",92,40,3,8,Zoid,Tour Guide8635,Tour Guide," Welcome to Hollywood! I must warn you, there's no refund if you get discovered and leave the tour!  I'm just kidding, that never happens. Now, to your right, you'll see 30th Century Fox Studios.  Fox uses those searchlights to blind pilots, then film the resulting plane crashes.
",281,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Bender8636,Bender," Neat!
",7,40,3,8,Tour Guide,Tour Guide8637,Tour Guide," Ahead, you'll see the home of Mel Gibson, star of the hit film, Bravehead.  And do we have any fans of Calculon, star of the robot soap opera All My Circuits?
",160,40,3,8,Bender,Bender8638,Bender," Oh! I am! Me!  Bender is!
",27,40,3,8,Tour Guide,Tour Guide8639,Tour Guide," Then you'll wanna get a close look at his luxurious Bel-Air home.
",67,40,3,8,Bender,Bender8640,Bender," Yes, I will.
",14,40,3,8,Tour Guide,Calculon8641,Calculon," Are you my new hot water heater?
",34,40,3,8,Bender,Bender8642,Bender," No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?
",40,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8643,Calculon," Absolutely not.
",17,40,3,8,Bender,Bender8644,Bender," Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause it was a lot, you remember, right?
",110,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8645,Calculon," Look, I'm programmed to be very busy. Unless you can heat water to 212 degrees, I'm not interested.  Have you got an extra GOTO 10 line? I said I don't need a bender.
",168,40,3,8,Bender,Bender8646,Bender," Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.
",51,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8647,Calculon," Nice work, Boiler.
",20,40,3,8,Bender,Bender8648,Bender," Thanks. And call me Bender.
",29,40,3,8,Calculon,Zoidberg8649,Zoidberg," That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid for lunch to discuss my Hollywood dreams. Next time you see me, don't be surprised if I've eaten.
",135,40,3,8,Bender,Zoidberg8650,Zoidberg," Uncle Zoid, you're looking young enough to be thrown back!
",60,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoid8651,Zoid," Rich nephew, come over here and give your uncle a nice, big meal.  So, here we are: A still-famous film comedian.
",115,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8652,Zoidberg," And a rich, respected doctor with many surviving patients.
",60,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8653,Zoid," Eating real food in a restaurant, as we both often do. So, you want to be a comedian, is it?
",94,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8654,Zoidberg," It's my lifelong dream.
",25,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8655,Zoid,"  Well that dream dies now.  You're unfunny and untalented. That's why you're perfect for drama.
",97,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8656,Zoidberg," Hmm. Serious drama. Perhaps it is time to give up comedy.
",59,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8657,Zoid," I'm putting together a big drama picture right now, as we speak. The script is dynamite. I know because I wrote it myself. And with me directing and starring, I'll be back on top after 50 miserable years--  Uh, of fame.
",221,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8658,Zoidberg," Ah, fame. Where do I come in?
",31,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8659,Zoid," This fame film has a juicy part for you, if you completely finance it with your doctor money. So, are you in?
",111,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8660,Zoidberg," Uh, OK. How much do I have to invest?
",39,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8661,Zoid," Oh, not much, not much,  A million dollars.   Then it's settled. Another blockbuster Hollywood deal.
",102,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Waiter8662,Waiter," What can I get you gentlemen?
",31,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoidberg8663,Zoidberg," Is bread free?
",16,40,3,8,Waiter,Waiter8664,Waiter," Yeah.
",7,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8665,Zoidberg," We'll split an order.
",23,40,3,8,Waiter,Bender8666,Bender," What's with Monstro?
",22,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Fry8667,Fry," He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.
",71,40,3,8,Bender,Zoidberg8668,Zoidberg,"  I've only been here a day and already I'm a Hollywood phoney.
",64,40,3,8,Fry,Bender8669,Bender,"  Well, perhaps I could call on TV's Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz.
",80,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Fry8670,Fry," Since when have you been in the biz?
",38,40,3,8,Bender,Bender8671,Bender," Long enough, little man. Long enough.
",39,40,3,8,Fry,Bender8672,Bender," Calculon, as your hot water heater ...  ... I would be remiss if I didn't bring you scripts that could make you an international film star.
",141,40,3,8,Bender,Calculon8673,Calculon," Of course. Tell me about the project.
",39,40,3,8,Bender,Zoidberg8674,Zoidberg," It's a movie.
",15,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8675,Calculon," Interesting. Tell me more.
",28,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Bender8676,Bender," Get this: For a scant $1 million investment, you can be the star.
",67,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8677,Calculon," And?
",6,40,3,8,Bender,Bender8678,Bender," And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar.
",46,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8679,Calculon," An Oscar, you say? That would get me out of this festering rat's nest called ""television"" once and for all. Let me see the script.  No. No, I don't like the font.  Wait! Harold Zoid? Was this written by the Harold Zoid?
",221,40,3,8,Bender,Zoidberg8680,Zoidberg," Written and Xeroxed.
",22,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8681,Calculon," Good heavens! A chance to work with the legendary Harold Zoid. He's one of my great idols. And-And you say you can guarantee me the Oscar?
",140,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Bender8682,Bender," I can guarantee anything you want.
",36,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8683,Calculon," Then I'll do it!
",18,40,3,8,Bender,Zoidberg8684,Zoidberg," Hooray!
",9,40,3,8,Calculon,Bender8685,Bender," Here's your chequebook.
",25,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Calculon8686,Calculon," Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our director, the legendary Harold Zoid!
",75,40,3,8,Bender,Zoid8687,Zoid," Thank you. A more classic movie plot there isn't: A son who does not want to follow in his father's business. And that business is being President of Earth, no less. The son, as it happens, is Vice President.
",210,40,3,8,Calculon,Bender8688,Bender,"  That plot makes perfect sense. Wink, wink.
",45,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoidberg8689,Zoidberg," Bender, you said ""wink, wink"" out loud.
",41,40,3,8,Bender,Bender8690,Bender," No, I didn't. Raise middle finger.
",36,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoid8691,Zoid," Now remember, and I can't stress this enough, this is a talkie, so I want the full gamut of emotions from every actor in every scene.
",135,40,3,8,Bender,Zoidberg8692,Zoidberg," The Magnificent Three. Scene one, take one.
",45,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8693,Zoid," And, action!
",14,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Calculon8694,Calculon," Take back your gilded pen, Father. Signing bills into law was always your dream, not mine.
",92,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8695,Zoid," Cut! Cut! Cut it!  I said this is a talkie, damnit! You've got to emote more! And you extras, wave your arms and make faces. What is this, a morgue?
",150,40,3,8,Calculon,Zoidberg8696,Zoidberg," The Magnificent Three. Scene 10, take 95.
",43,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8697,Zoid," Action. And I mean circus-grade action.
",41,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Calculon8698,Calculon,"  Sir, I call upon you not as a President but as a father.
",59,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8699,Zoid," Cut, cut, cut it!  Would you show a little emotion?  People, people, please. Just because it's a dramatic scene, doesn't mean you can't do a little comedy in the background.  Throw a pie or two, for God's sake.
",212,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8700,Calculon,"  Nooo!
",8,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8701,Zoid," Cut, cut it! Eck! Look, look, it's alright, kid. We'll, uh, we'll get it in editing. Alright, that's a wrap, everybody. I'm gonna see you all at the premiere which, by the way, when is?
",187,40,3,8,Calculon,Zoidberg8702,Zoidberg," Well, editing is a long and expensive process but we spent all the money on pies, so it'll be ready Friday.
",109,40,3,8,Zoid,Bender8703,Bender," Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel.
",66,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Calculon8704,Calculon," I just pray they like me half as much as I do.
",48,40,3,8,Bender,Calculon8705,Calculon,"  I agreed to be your Vice President but I never agreed to be your son.  Thank you, Lieutenant Smith.
",102,40,3,8,Calculon,Zoidberg8706,Zoidberg,"  Good morning, Mr. Vice President!
",36,40,3,8,Calculon,Fry8707,Fry," Leela, we're missing the premiere.  My only goal in life was to attend a Hollywood shindig. Just pay the valet the two bucks.
",127,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Leela8708,Leela," No! It's the principle of the thing. Besides, I think I see a parking lot up ahead.
",85,40,3,8,Fry,Calculon8709,Calculon,"  Father, I've asked you to join me on the White House roof so we could have a heart-to-heart talk. I will never follow in your footsteps. Here is my resignation as Vice President.
",181,40,3,8,Leela,Zoid8710,Zoid,"  No! My son will not shame me like this. I would sooner die, I would!
",71,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8711,Calculon,"  Father! The ledge!
",21,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8712,Zoid,"  Oy!
",6,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8713,Calculon,"  Oh!
",6,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoidberg8714,Zoidberg,"  The President is dead. Congratulations, Mr. President!
",57,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8715,Calculon,"  Nooo!
",8,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Bender8716,Bender,"  Woo-hoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!
",35,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8717,Calculon," Everyone walked out. They hated it. I've seen plagues that had better opening nights than this. You said that Oscar was practically on my mantel.
",147,40,3,8,Bender,Bender8718,Bender," Now you know why I use the qualifier, ""practically"".
",54,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8719,Calculon," You listen to me. I'm out a million bucks here! You get me that Oscar or you're dead! You and these snivelling lobsters! Dead. You hear me? Dead!
",147,40,3,8,Bender,Zoid8720,Zoid," Oy, now he emotes!
",20,40,3,8,Calculon,Zoidberg8721,Zoidberg," Let's just hope Calculon breaks our legs; they'll grow back.
",62,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8722,Zoid," He's gonna kill us, you klutzel! Who told that under-acting stiff he was going to get an Oscar?
",97,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Bender8723,Bender," Me. It seemed like the least honest way to get him to pay for the movie.
",74,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8724,Zoid," He paid?  I though you paid, with your big-shot doctor money.
",63,40,3,8,Bender,Zoidberg8725,Zoidberg,"  I lied.
",10,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8726,Zoid," OK, enough with the blubbering, already. The way I directed the hell out of him, he may still very well get the nomination.
",125,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Bender8727,Bender," Wink.
",7,40,3,8,Zoid,Calculon8728,Calculon," 400 categories and not a single nomination for me.
",52,40,3,8,Bender,Zoidberg8729,Zoidberg," But you won this Golden Globe!
",32,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8730,Calculon," Piffle! That's the Emmy of movie awards!  I told you I want an Oscar.
",71,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Bender8731,Bender," Then maybe you should act better.
",35,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8732,Calculon," The Oscar isn't about acting. It's about earning the respect and admiration of the creative community.
",104,40,3,8,Bender,Zoid8733,Zoid," How 'bout we rig the awards?
",30,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8734,Calculon," That's fine too.
",18,40,3,8,Zoid,Leela8735,Leela," It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it.
",64,40,3,8,Calculon,Fry8736,Fry," Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy the sights.  Oh, my God! Sylvester Stallone!
",119,40,3,8,Leela,Zoidberg8737,Zoidberg," This is where you live? I though you were a big-shot Hollywood movie star.
",76,40,3,8,Fry,Zoid8738,Zoid," No, I'm not. I'm an even bigger liar than you. My career went down the tubes the day they invented smell-a-vision.
",116,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Bender8739,Bender," Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.
",69,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8740,Zoid," Oy. All I wanted was for people to think of me one last time before I die.
",76,40,3,8,Bender,Zoidberg8741,Zoidberg," What are you talking about, Uncle? Everybody remembers Harold Zoid!
",69,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8742,Zoid," As a pathetic has-been, they remember me. As a forgotten relic, they remember me. Bah! It's better to die now.
",112,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8743,Zoidberg," No. This is one death Dr. Zoidberg won't be responsible for. Zoidberg away!
",77,40,3,8,Zoid,Rivers8744,Rivers," Hi, I'm Joan Rivers' head. I tell you, I've had so many face-lifts, they finally lifted it right off my body! It's true, it's true! Oh, oh, oh! Here comes Jack Nicholson's DNA reconstituted in a gorilla body.
",210,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Bender8745,Bender," Catering.
",11,40,3,8,Rivers,Rivers8746,Rivers," Oh, and here's washed-up actor, whatshisname, Harold Zoid. Are you presenting one of those tacky honorary awards, or just getting one?
",136,40,3,8,Bender,Zoid8747,Zoid," I'm a seat-filler, Joan's head. My only marketable skill is to occupy space.
",78,40,3,8,Rivers,Calculon8748,Calculon," You know, the second I don't win that award, you're cat food. Right, Boxy?
",76,40,3,8,Zoid,Announcer #18749,Announcer #1," And now, the host of the 1074th Academy Awards, Billy Crystal.
",64,40,3,8,Calculon,Crystal8750,Crystal," Now I know how a Pez dispenser feels.  Oh, you like that one, Jack?  Alright, we're already one hour behind.  Our first award tonight: Best Cinematography in a Non-Visible Spectrum.
",183,40,3,8,Announcer #1,Fry8751,Fry," It's been two weeks. You wanna play tic-tac-toe again before we eat our shoes?
",80,40,3,8,Crystal,Leela8752,Leela," Oh, I always knew I'd die at the bottom of a pit. But a pit full of tar?
",74,40,3,8,Fry,Fry8753,Fry," What was that? A tar dolphin or a tar shark?
",46,40,3,8,Leela,Leela8754,Leela," It's some kind of hollow tube, devoid of human life.  The Los Angeles subway! We can blast our way in and escape!
",115,40,3,8,Fry,Fry8755,Fry," Alright, but I still feel like having a shoe.
",47,40,3,8,Leela,Zoidberg8756,Zoidberg," What category are they on?
",28,40,3,8,Fry,Bender8757,Bender," They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to writing.
",79,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8758,Zoidberg," That just leaves Best Soft-Drink Product Placement and then Best Actor. We don't have much time.
",98,40,3,8,Bender,Crystal8759,Crystal," And the nominees for Best Soft-Drink Product Placement are:
",61,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Slurm Machine8760,Slurm Machine," Star Trek: The Pepsi Generation, They Call Me Mr. Pibb and Snow White and the 7 Ups.
",86,40,3,8,Crystal,Bender8761,Bender," And now to present the award for Best Actor ...  ... a bit player in the flop movie The Magnificent Three ...  ... Dr. Zoidberg.
",130,40,3,8,Slurm Machine,Calculon8762,Calculon,"  OK, Boxy, keep your prong on the trigger.
",44,40,3,8,Bender,Zoidberg8763,Zoidberg," And the nominees for Best Actor are: Sir Lawrence--  ... in The Merchant of Venus, Hive Mind Gamma 7X in Bikini Party Summer, the Soda Machine Robot in Bikini Party Summer, Mark Jones in How Beige Was My Jacket and, instead of the fifth guy, Calculon, for his powerhouse performance in The Magnificent Three.
",310,40,3,8,Calculon,Man #18764,Man #1," Uh-oh, he read the wrong name.
",32,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Man #1 #28765,Man #1 #2,"  Shh, just play along, like they did for Marisa Tomei.
",56,40,3,8,Man #1,Zoid8766,Zoid," Hooray, I won't be murdered. I'll live another day. Another day of ... pathetic, forgotten misery.
",100,40,3,8,Man #1 #2,Zoidberg8767,Zoidberg," And the winner is...  And the winner, instead of any of the nominees, is the legendary Harold Zoid!
",101,40,3,8,Zoid,Zoid8768,Zoid," Thank you. Thank you so much! You know, through all my ups and downs, I always thought the most important thing in life was to win an Oscar. But tonight I realise what's really important is to win two Oscars. Ha! Ha! I'm kidding, I'm kidding. What really matters in life is that people care about you, whether it's a whole crowd ...  ... or just one die-hard fan.
",365,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoid8769,Zoid," Thank you, nephew.  Now I can die happy. 10 seconds from now, when Calculon kills us.
",87,40,3,8,Zoid,Calculon8770,Calculon," Harold Zoid!
",14,40,3,8,Zoid,Bender8771,Bender," Hit the deck!
",15,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8772,Calculon," Where's that Oscar?
",21,40,3,8,Bender,Zoid8773,Zoid," Here, enjoy. What are you getting upset? It's slightly less fraudulent for you to have it.
",92,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8774,Calculon," Yes. Yes, it's a real beauty. Someday I hope to win one of my own.
",68,40,3,8,Zoid,Bender8775,Bender," Then you're not going to kill us, Your Majesty?
",49,40,3,8,Calculon,Calculon8776,Calculon," Nay. I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.
",89,40,3,8,Bender,Zoidberg8777,Zoidberg," Earthquake!
",13,40,3,8,Calculon,Bender8778,Bender," Hit the deck!
",15,40,3,8,Zoidberg,Zoid8779,Zoid," Let the earth quake, I've got somebody's Oscar!
",49,40,3,8,Bender,Fry8780,Fry," We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!
",39,40,3,8,Zoid,Doorman8781,Doorman," I'm sorry, sir, this is a private-- Oh, pardon me, I see you're with Mr. Stallone.
",84,40,3,8,Fry,Morbo8782,Morbo," So I gave the cookies you made to Fawn and the kids and they couldn't believe it -- they were delicious. But, I digress.   Tremble, puny earthlings! One day my race will destroy you all!
",188,41,3,9,Doorman,Leela8783,Leela," Could one of you guys get that?
",33,41,3,9,Morbo,Leela8784,Leela," It's a doorbell baby!  Hello, little guy. You know, I was abandoned as a baby too, so--
",89,41,3,9,Leela,Bender8785,Bender," Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it.
",37,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8786,Leela," Bender, stop! It's a baby!
",28,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8787,Bender,"  A baby what?  Ow!
",20,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8788,Leela," Oh, it's just a card. From the orphanarium I grew up in.
",58,41,3,9,Bender,Card8789,Card," Leela, you're invited to a reunion at Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium.  Please stand clear of self-destructing basket.
",129,41,3,9,Leela,Bender8790,Bender," A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? You gonna go?
",54,41,3,9,Card,Leela8791,Leela," No way, Jose-bot. I never wanna see those other orphans again! Not after the way they used to pick on me.
",107,41,3,9,Bender,Kids8792,Kids,"  One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
",29,41,3,9,Leela,Kirk8793,Kirk," Nice depth-perception, one-eye!
",33,41,3,9,Kids,Leela8794,Leela," How can you make fun of me, Kirk? You're blind!
",49,41,3,9,Kirk,Kirk8795,Kirk," My eyes may not work, but at least I got two of them!
",55,41,3,9,Leela,Fry8796,Fry," Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine the look on their faces when you show up with two friends who eat all the hors d'Oeuvres.
",132,41,3,9,Kirk,Leela8797,Leela," Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success in a few choice faces.
",65,41,3,9,Fry,Bender8798,Bender," Set a course for adventure!
",29,41,3,9,Leela,Fry8799,Fry," Ew!
",5,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8800,Bender," What a dump!
",14,41,3,9,Fry,Leela8801,Leela," Just like old times. Gosh! The bars on the windows seemed so much thicker back then.  Mr. Vogel? Remember me?
",111,41,3,9,Bender,Vogel8802,Vogel," Leela! You're worthless and no one will ever love you!
",56,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8803,Leela," You used to say that all the time!
",36,41,3,9,Vogel,Vogel8804,Vogel," Oh, those were happier days.
",30,41,3,9,Leela,Fry8805,Fry," Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't half bad.
",47,41,3,9,Vogel,Bender8806,Bender," And try one of these Popsicle sticks. They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour.
",80,41,3,9,Fry,Leela8807,Leela," Hey, look. It's our old group picture.
",40,41,3,9,Bender,Fry8808,Fry," I don't see you anywhere.
",27,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8809,Leela," That's me over in Cootietown.
",31,41,3,9,Fry,Bender8810,Bender," Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking guy!
",47,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8811,Leela," That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have kind of a crush on him.
",61,41,3,9,Bender,Kids8812,Kids,"  One-eye! One-eye!
",20,41,3,9,Leela,French Guy8813,French Guy," Stupid as a French guy!
",25,41,3,9,Kids,Kids8814,Kids,"  One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
",74,41,3,9,French Guy,Leela8815,Leela," Well, it's time to say hello to the old gang.
",47,41,3,9,Kids,Man #18816,Man #1," So, whatcha been up to since you left the orphanarium?
",56,41,3,9,Leela,Man #1 #28817,Man #1 #2," Uh, living in a box, fighting the shakes. You?
",48,41,3,9,Man #1,Man #18818,Man #1," Selling kidneys, teeth, whatever falls out of me.
",51,41,3,9,Man #1 #2,Leela8819,Leela," And what am I up to, you ask? Why, I'm a very successful space captain.
",73,41,3,9,Man #1,Man #1 #28820,Man #1 #2," Oh.
",5,41,3,9,Leela,Man #18821,Man #1," Wow.
",6,41,3,9,Man #1 #2,Man #1 #38822,Man #1 #3," How nice for you, Leela.
",26,41,3,9,Man #1,Woman #18823,Woman #1," That's so good for a person with one eye.
",43,41,3,9,Man #1 #3,Leela8824,Leela," Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm a space captain and you're a bunch of losers.
",85,41,3,9,Woman #1,Man #18825,Man #1," Uh, right, right. We're the losers!
",37,41,3,9,Leela,Kirk8826,Kirk," Well, if it isn't old one-eye!
",32,41,3,9,Man #1,Leela8827,Leela," Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!
",36,41,3,9,Kirk,Man #1 #38828,Man #1 #3," He can't hear you. He's deaf now.
",35,41,3,9,Leela,Adlai8829,Adlai," Leave Leela alone. She's leading a perfectly normal life. She's not gussied up, duded out, getting down or where it's at. Now run along.
",138,41,3,9,Man #1 #3,Leela8830,Leela," Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really outgrow being an eyeball-- Oddball!
",77,41,3,9,Adlai,Adlai8831,Adlai," Nonsense. You're a space captain. That's a fine, conventional profession.
",75,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8832,Leela," Well, you know, it's just for a package delivery service.
",59,41,3,9,Adlai,Adlai8833,Adlai," Ah-ah. A package is just a box until it's delivered.
",54,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8834,Leela," Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. So what do you do these days?
",70,41,3,9,Adlai,Adlai8835,Adlai," Oh, I'm a doctor.
",19,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8836,Leela," A tall doctor, you say?
",25,41,3,9,Adlai,Vogel8837,Vogel," Sir, you seem pretty stable. Have you thought about adopting one of our kids?
",79,41,3,9,Leela,Fry8838,Fry," Sure haven't.
",15,41,3,9,Vogel,Vogel8839,Vogel," Well keep adoption in mind. It's a great way to have a kid without having sex.
",80,41,3,9,Fry,Fry8840,Fry,"  Really?
",10,41,3,9,Vogel,Vogel8841,Vogel," Plus, the government will help out with a small stipend of $100 a week.
",73,41,3,9,Fry,Bender8842,Bender," $100 a week?
",14,41,3,9,Vogel,Adlai8843,Adlai," I'm so sorry I teased you back then. Let me make it up to you. I can fix it so no one ever makes fun of you again.
",116,41,3,9,Bender,Leela8844,Leela," You mean by beating them up? Because I've broken that blind kid's nose like 10 times and it doesn't make any difference.
",122,41,3,9,Adlai,Adlai8845,Adlai," No, I specialise in phaser eye surgery. I can build you a paraffin eye and graft it on with skin from your foot. It won't be able to see but you'll look like a perfectly normal two-eyed person.
",195,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8846,Leela," Me? Perfectly normal?
",23,41,3,9,Adlai,Bender8847,Bender," Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry.
",34,41,3,9,Leela,Fry8848,Fry," Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your ass?
",77,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8849,Bender," No. It's called ""parenting"". Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends to collect.
",95,41,3,9,Fry,Boy8850,Boy," Our daddy's a giant toy!
",26,41,3,9,Bender,Farnsworth8851,Farnsworth," Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping at her eye all the time.
",104,41,3,9,Boy,Amy8852,Amy," I think cosmetic surgery's great, Leela. I used to be too cute, so I had cuteness-reduction surgery here ...  ... and here.
",125,41,3,9,Farnsworth,Fry8853,Fry," You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need surgery. You look great the way you are.
",81,41,3,9,Amy,Leela8854,Leela," Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once in my life, I just wanna look normal.
",78,41,3,9,Fry,Fry8855,Fry," But you're better than normal, you're abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't care what other people think.
",108,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8856,Leela," You're right! I'll start by not caring what you think!  I'm getting the surgery.
",82,41,3,9,Fry,Farnsworth8857,Farnsworth," That a girl!
",14,41,3,9,Leela,Amy8858,Amy," Right on!
",11,41,3,9,Farnsworth,Zoidberg8859,Zoidberg," Wonderful. And while you're under the knife, you could also get an ink pouch to help you escape your enemies.
",111,41,3,9,Amy,Farnsworth8860,Farnsworth," That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard, you imbecile!
",58,41,3,9,Zoidberg,Adlai8861,Adlai," Now we'll find out if the operation was a success. Hold on to your hats.  Oh, I'm sorry, this is the wrong patient.  Oops.
",124,41,3,9,Farnsworth,Amy8862,Amy," Leela, those eyes look so great on you.
",41,41,3,9,Adlai,Fry8863,Fry," Bah! I think she looked fine before.
",38,41,3,9,Amy,Farnsworth8864,Farnsworth," No.
",5,41,3,9,Fry,Zoidberg8865,Zoidberg," No.
",5,41,3,9,Farnsworth,Amy8866,Amy," Uh-uh.
",8,41,3,9,Zoidberg,Hermes8867,Hermes," Wrong.
",8,41,3,9,Amy,Leela8868,Leela," Wow, look at me. Although I don't have the hang of blinking yet.
",66,41,3,9,Hermes,Adlai8869,Adlai," You'll get it. Personally, I try not to blink too much because it seems flashy. But when I do, I enjoy it.
",108,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8870,Leela," I did it! I blunk!
",20,41,3,9,Adlai,Hermes8871,Hermes," And just in time to screw up this picture I took!
",51,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8872,Leela," Hooray!
",9,41,3,9,Hermes,Walt8873,Walt," Ow!
",5,41,3,9,Leela,Igner8874,Igner," Ow!
",5,41,3,9,Walt,Larry8875,Larry," Ow!
",5,41,3,9,Igner,Leela8876,Leela," I've never felt so unremarkable! Today I actually blended in with a crowd!
",76,41,3,9,Larry,Bender8877,Bender," Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with.
",38,41,3,9,Leela,Kids8878,Kids,"  Hello, jerkbags!
",19,41,3,9,Bender,Amy8879,Amy," Oh, they're so cute! What are their names?
",44,41,3,9,Kids,Bender8880,Bender," Kids have names?
",18,41,3,9,Amy,Nina8881,Nina," My name's Nina, and his name's Albert--
",41,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8882,Bender," And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.!  Lookie here! My first government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!
",130,41,3,9,Nina,Sally8883,Sally," Daddy Bender, we're hungry.
",29,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8884,Bender," What is it with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food!  Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food.
",108,41,3,9,Sally,Albert8885,Albert," Can we have Bender burgers again?
",35,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8886,Bender," No. The cat shelter's on to me!
",33,41,3,9,Albert,Adlai8887,Adlai," Hello, Leela. I was in a nearby tailor getting one of my Hawai'ian shirts toned down, so I thought I'd drop in for your follow-up exam.
",137,41,3,9,Bender,Leela8888,Leela," Oh. That's so handsome of you.
",32,41,3,9,Adlai,Adlai8889,Adlai," Just follow the light with your eyes.  Perfect! You know, a guy could fall head-over-heels for a gal like you.  As for me, I'm somewhat interested myself.
",156,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8890,Leela," What are you saying?
",22,41,3,9,Adlai,Adlai8891,Adlai," I've never been good with words, which is why I'm in such a delicate conundrum. Will you go out with me this Sunday?
",118,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8892,Leela," Sure!
",7,41,3,9,Adlai,Adlai8893,Adlai," I don't know what else to say, so I'll just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then.
",79,41,3,9,Leela,Fry8894,Fry," This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's only interested now that you have two eyes.
",117,41,3,9,Adlai,Leela8895,Leela," You're just jealous!
",22,41,3,9,Fry,Fry8896,Fry," No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!
",58,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8897,Leela," Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with him no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life.
",139,41,3,9,Fry,Zoidberg8898,Zoidberg," Be careful with that Adlai, Leela, he's a doctor, they're very poor.
",70,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8899,Leela," Actually, most doctors are rich.
",34,41,3,9,Zoidberg,Zoidberg8900,Zoidberg," What? When did this happen? You're joking, right?  That's not funny!
",70,41,3,9,Leela,Bender8901,Bender," OK, they've got everything you need here: Booze, a couple of peanuts, they got a crapper in the back. That's one of the things you kids do, right?
",148,41,3,9,Zoidberg,Albert8902,Albert," Yeah.
",7,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8903,Bender," Then knock yourself out.  Hey! Hey! Only eat and drink enough to barely keep yourselves alive! I'm trying to make a profit here.
",130,41,3,9,Albert,Nina8904,Nina," Daddy! Bethany's hitting me!
",30,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8905,Bender," Here.
",7,41,3,9,Nina,Fembot #18906,Fembot #1," These kids yours?
",19,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8907,Bender," Yeah.
",7,41,3,9,Fembot #1,Fembot #18908,Fembot #1," Ooh. I'm attracted to a man with responsibility!
",50,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8909,Bender," That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some fun.
",86,41,3,9,Fembot #1,Boy8910,Boy," Daddy Bender?
",15,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8911,Bender," Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!
",103,41,3,9,Boy,Boy8912,Boy," I love you, Daddy Bender!
",27,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8913,Bender," Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!
",52,41,3,9,Boy,Fembot #18914,Fembot #1," I guess you're busy. I'll catch you later.
",44,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8915,Bender," You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull but I got half a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it!   Oh, come on!
",148,41,3,9,Fembot #1,Adlai8916,Adlai," I thought I'd take you someplace ordinary, a place no one could object to.
",76,41,3,9,Bender,Leela8917,Leela," That sounds wonderful.
",24,41,3,9,Adlai,Man #1 #48918,Man #1 #4," I'd like an extra-beautiful bouquet for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart.
",71,41,3,9,Leela,Adlai8919,Adlai," Average, please.
",18,41,3,9,Man #1 #4,Leela8920,Leela," Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or avoided staring at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird.
",144,41,3,9,Adlai,Adlai8921,Adlai," Leela, you're 999,999 in a million!
",37,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8922,Leela," Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?
",69,41,3,9,Adlai,Zoidberg8923,Zoidberg,"  Totally.
",11,41,3,9,Leela,Adlai8924,Adlai," Uh, listen. I just want you all to know your Leela's one standard lady.
",73,41,3,9,Zoidberg,Leela8925,Leela," Oh, Adlai, stop!
",18,41,3,9,Adlai,Fry8926,Fry," What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren't normal and that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg: He's a weird monster who smells like he eats garbage and does.
",190,41,3,9,Leela,Zoidberg8927,Zoidberg," Damn right!
",13,41,3,9,Fry,Fry8928,Fry," And the Professor's a senile, amoral crackpot.  Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.
",85,41,3,9,Zoidberg,Hermes8929,Hermes," Tally me banana.
",18,41,3,9,Fry,Fry8930,Fry," Amy's a klutz from Mars.
",26,41,3,9,Hermes,Amy8931,Amy," Sploops!
",10,41,3,9,Fry,Farnsworth8932,Farnsworth," And, Fry, you've got that brain thing.
",40,41,3,9,Amy,Fry8933,Fry," I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?
",135,41,3,9,Farnsworth,Leela8934,Leela," That's the dumbest question I ever heard!
",43,41,3,9,Fry,Farnsworth8935,Farnsworth," She's right!
",14,41,3,9,Leela,Zoidberg8936,Zoidberg," No doubt about it.
",20,41,3,9,Farnsworth,Amy8937,Amy," Duh!
",6,41,3,9,Zoidberg,Hermes8938,Hermes," Daylight come!
",16,41,3,9,Amy,Bender8939,Bender," Coming through, watch your heads!
",35,41,3,9,Hermes,Zoidberg8940,Zoidberg," Help! I'm under attack!
",25,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8941,Bender," Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right.
",80,41,3,9,Zoidberg,Elzar8942,Elzar," Which one of you cutie muffins gets the children's spicy squab?
",65,41,3,9,Bender,Sam8943,Sam," Me!
",5,41,3,9,Elzar,Bender8944,Bender," Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?
",60,41,3,9,Sam,Sam8945,Sam," 'Bout time!
",13,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8946,Bender," That's my boy!
",16,41,3,9,Sam,Elzar8947,Elzar," And here's your check. Bam!
",29,41,3,9,Bender,Albert8948,Albert," I gotta go poopy!
",19,41,3,9,Elzar,Bender8949,Bender," Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!
",111,41,3,9,Albert,Elzar8950,Elzar,"  You little crooks! If I catch you I'm going to make cutie-muffin gumbo!
",74,41,3,9,Bender,Adlai8951,Adlai," You know, seeing that strange robot force 12 children to do his bidding makes me think about kids of our own.
",111,41,3,9,Elzar,Leela8952,Leela," Us? Me? You? Kids?
",20,41,3,9,Adlai,Adlai8953,Adlai," That's correct. It's time to stop living this vida bachelor loca, settle down and have kids.
",94,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8954,Leela," Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!
",58,41,3,9,Adlai,Albert8955,Albert," Daddy Bender, I want a piggy back ride.
",41,41,3,9,Leela,Bender8956,Bender," Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog-pile on Fry.
",57,41,3,9,Albert,Sally8957,Sally," Tell us a story, Daddy Bender.
",32,41,3,9,Bender,Kids8958,Kids,"  Story! Story! Story!
",23,41,3,9,Sally,Bender8959,Bender," Alright, fine, gather round.
",30,41,3,9,Kids,Nina8960,Nina," We wanna hear this one again!
",31,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8961,Bender,"  ""Bender's Arrest Record"" by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was caught shoplifting.
",94,41,3,9,Nina,Albert8962,Albert," Yeah, show us the picture!  There he is!
",42,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8963,Bender," OK, kids. It's 9.00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking at you so go to bed.  The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma.
",135,41,3,9,Albert,Bender8964,Bender," Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps!  Oh! I need a calculator.
",92,41,3,9,Bender,Fry8965,Fry," You are a calculator.
",23,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8966,Bender," I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper--  I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing me 110!
",129,41,3,9,Fry,Fry8967,Fry," There goes my new kitchen cabinets.
",37,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8968,Bender," I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!
",72,41,3,9,Fry,Sam8969,Sam," Daddy, how do I flush you?
",28,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8970,Bender,"  Just go to bed!
",18,41,3,9,Sam,Adlai8971,Adlai," You know, doing this jigsaw puzzle of a pacifier factory makes me want to have children with you all the more.
",112,41,3,9,Bender,Leela8972,Leela," Adlai, I was thinking, since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt a child.
",81,41,3,9,Adlai,Adlai8973,Adlai," Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable. Heck, it's more than acceptable, it's adequately satisfactory!
",98,41,3,9,Leela,Bender8974,Bender," Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale. Let me check.  Oh, aren't you a cutie?  About 35lbs.  What?
",140,41,3,9,Adlai,Leela8975,Leela," Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child.
",41,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8976,Bender," Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans today?
",177,41,3,9,Leela,Adlai8977,Adlai," Uh, I'm afraid we only want one.
",34,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8978,Bender," Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock.
",61,41,3,9,Adlai,Leela8979,Leela," I remember this from when we were kids: The warden would trot you out in front of prospective parents and they'd judge you like a piece of meat.
",146,41,3,9,Bender,Albert8980,Albert," I'm Albert.
",13,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8981,Leela," Kind of fatty.
",16,41,3,9,Albert,Bender8982,Bender," Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.
",74,41,3,9,Leela,Leela8983,Leela," Uh, um.
",9,41,3,9,Bender,Adlai8984,Adlai," Hmm.
",6,41,3,9,Leela,Bender8985,Bender," If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit.  Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion I understand is called ""love"".
",160,41,3,9,Adlai,Sally8986,Sally," One time, I did a hundred jump ropes.
",39,41,3,9,Bender,Leela8987,Leela," Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it.
",57,41,3,9,Sally,Bender8988,Bender," OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk now, time for bed.
",51,41,3,9,Leela,Albert8989,Albert," But it's 10 in the morning!
",29,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8990,Bender," I said hit the hay!
",21,41,3,9,Albert,Leela8991,Leela," Oh, they're all so adorable.
",30,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8992,Bender," Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England.
",135,41,3,9,Leela,Smitty8993,Smitty," You're under arrest for child cruelty, child endangerment, depriving children of food, selling children as food and misrepresenting the weight of livestock.
",158,41,3,9,Bender,Bender8994,Bender," If you had kids of your own, you'd understand!
",48,41,3,9,Smitty,Leela8995,Leela," Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?
",61,41,3,9,Bender,Smitty8996,Smitty," Might as well. They're just gonna rot in the evidence locker.
",63,41,3,9,Leela,Orphan #18997,Orphan #1," Nice ear!
",11,41,3,9,Smitty,Orphan #28998,Orphan #2," Hey, freaky ears!
",19,41,3,9,Orphan #1,Orphan #38999,Orphan #3," How's you hearing?
",20,41,3,9,Orphan #2,Leela9000,Leela," I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.
",40,41,3,9,Orphan #3,Adlai9001,Adlai," Her? But there's plenty of normal ones.
",41,41,3,9,Leela,Leela9002,Leela," Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad.
",53,41,3,9,Adlai,Kids9003,Kids,"  Ear-face! Ear-face! Sally won the ugly race!
",47,41,3,9,Leela,Adlai9004,Adlai," On the other hand, the children bring up a good point. She does have an ear on her face.
",90,41,3,9,Kids,Leela9005,Leela," Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home.
",73,41,3,9,Adlai,Adlai9006,Adlai," Oh, alright. If you really want that one, I can give her an operation to make her acceptable.
",95,41,3,9,Leela,Leela9007,Leela," She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!
",59,41,3,9,Adlai,Adlai9008,Adlai," Oh, and I suppose you were fine the way you were?
",51,41,3,9,Leela,Leela9009,Leela," Damn right I was!
",19,41,3,9,Adlai,Fry9010,Fry," Yay!
",6,41,3,9,Leela,Leela9011,Leela," Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just wished I'd realised that when I was her age.
",115,41,3,9,Fry,Sally9012,Sally," I also have a tail!
",21,41,3,9,Leela,Leela9013,Leela," Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right now!
",76,41,3,9,Sally,Adlai9014,Adlai," Why should I do that?
",23,41,3,9,Leela,Leela9015,Leela," Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is gonna have one eye.
",72,41,3,9,Adlai,Vogel9016,Vogel," In recognition of Bender's generous gift of 12 orphans and a government cheque for 1200 wing-wangs, I hereby rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez Orphanarium!
",168,41,3,9,Leela,Fry9017,Fry," It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back.
",53,41,3,9,Vogel,Leela9018,Leela," Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little weird.
",90,41,3,9,Fry,Fry9019,Fry," Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything.
",45,41,3,9,Leela,Albert9020,Albert," We'll miss you, Daddy Bender.
",31,41,3,9,Fry,Nina9021,Nina," We know robots don't have emotions but we drawed you this picture.
",68,41,3,9,Albert,Sally9022,Sally," So if you ever miss us, even just a teeny bit, you can look at it.
",68,41,3,9,Nina,Bender9023,Bender," Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh!  Hey! What the-- Get away! Come on! I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey!  I hate you! I hate you all!
",161,41,3,9,Sally,Leo9024,Leo,"  Yes?
",7,42,3,10,Bender,Amy9025,Amy," Hi, Dad. It's me and my co-workers.
",37,42,3,10,Leo,Mrs. Wong9026,Mrs. Wong,"  Open up, Leo. It's Amy and her weirdos.
",42,42,3,10,Amy,Mrs. Wong9027,Mrs. Wong," Howdy, friends! Welcome to Mars!
",34,42,3,10,Mrs. Wong,Leela9028,Leela," Thanks so much for inviting us, Mr. Wong. I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue.
",83,42,3,10,Mrs. Wong,Leo9029,Leo," Oh, Mars Day much better than Earth Day. Dump trash wherever you want! Big, empty planet!
",91,42,3,10,Leela,Mrs. Wong9030,Mrs. Wong," OK, then. Make yourselves at home.
",36,42,3,10,Leo,Zoidberg9031,Zoidberg," Don't mind if I already did. By the way, do you have anymore of this Dom Perignon bubble bath? There was only enough to fill the tub halfway.
",143,42,3,10,Mrs. Wong,Farnsworth9032,Farnsworth," This is quite a large ranch you have.
",39,42,3,10,Zoidberg,Leo9033,Leo," 17.9 billion acres. We own entire western hemisphere.  That the best hemisphere!
",82,42,3,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth9034,Farnsworth," It's the same on Earth.
",25,42,3,10,Leo,Leo9035,Leo," Here is most number one product of all: The mighty buggalo. They used for everything; meat, milk and their shells make good row boat.
",135,42,3,10,Farnsworth,Zoidberg9036,Zoidberg,"  I broke your television.
",27,42,3,10,Leo,Hermes9037,Hermes," Mon, it must take forever to brand all those cattle.
",54,42,3,10,Zoidberg,Leo9038,Leo," Not really. We own so much stuff it easier just to brand everything that not ours.
",84,42,3,10,Hermes,Hermes9039,Hermes," Please don't do that.
",23,42,3,10,Leo,Amy9040,Amy," Betsy!  This is my sweet, little Betsy. I raised her from a larva that ate one of my sweaters.
",96,42,3,10,Hermes,Leo9041,Leo," Yes, everybody love Betsy. We going to eat her at Amy's wedding. If she ever get married!
",91,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9042,Amy," Dad! Gleesh! Please don't say things like that when you meet my boyfriend tonight.
",84,42,3,10,Leo,Leo9043,Leo," Oh, that right. We finally get to spend some time with this Mr. Kif.
",70,42,3,10,Amy,Mrs. Wong9044,Mrs. Wong," I just hope he's a nice man who can make us lot of grandchildren. This not some parallel universe where you getting any younger.
",130,42,3,10,Leo,Zapp9045,Zapp," Now remember, Kif, the quickest way to a girl's bed is through her parents. Have sex with them and you're in.
",111,42,3,10,Mrs. Wong,Kif9046,Kif," Actually, sir, I'm-I'm a little nervous about meeting her family.
",67,42,3,10,Zapp,Zapp9047,Zapp," Well that's natural. After all you're meek and uninteresting. Until now you've gotten by on my left-over charisma, scrounging off it like a tiny charisma parasite.
",165,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9048,Kif," I just hope they like me.
",27,42,3,10,Zapp,Zapp9049,Zapp," And why wouldn't they? Yes, yes, I know. Tiny, meek, uninteresting. Spare me your tedious life story, Kif. And above all have fun!
",132,42,3,10,Kif,Bender9050,Bender," Yeah, yeah, get on down!  Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!
",85,42,3,10,Zapp,DJ9051,DJ," Yo, fool, it's Mixmaster Festus!
",34,42,3,10,Bender,Fry9052,Fry," So what's Mars Day about, anyway?
",35,42,3,10,DJ,Mrs. Wong9053,Mrs. Wong," It commemorate the day centuries ago when our ancestor, Sir Reginald Wong, bought Mars from stupid natives.
",109,42,3,10,Fry,Leela9054,Leela," How can you call the Native Martians ""stupid""?
",48,42,3,10,Mrs. Wong,Leo9055,Leo," They sell whole planet for one bead. Sound stupid to me!
",58,42,3,10,Leela,Farnsworth9056,Farnsworth," That is stupid!
",17,42,3,10,Leo,Leela9057,Leela," I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud, bead-loving people.
",92,42,3,10,Farnsworth,Fry9058,Fry," Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!
",32,42,3,10,Leela,Leela9059,Leela," Of course it is. But you don't have to laugh!
",47,42,3,10,Fry,Kif9060,Kif," Amy, no! Not on your parents' planet!
",39,42,3,10,Leela,RJ9061,RJ," Howdy, Amy. Glad to see you've come back to the country. It's where the flavour is.
",85,42,3,10,Kif,Amy9062,Amy," RJ, this is my boyfriend, Kif.
",32,42,3,10,RJ,RJ9063,RJ," This wimp? You've gone a long way, baby.  Cigarette, partner?
",63,42,3,10,Amy,Kif9064,Kif," Oh, I don't--
",15,42,3,10,RJ,RJ9065,RJ," I haven't even lit it yet!
",28,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9066,Kif," Oh. Is it lit now?
",20,42,3,10,RJ,RJ9067,RJ," Yep.  You're pathetic!
",24,42,3,10,Kif,Zoidberg9068,Zoidberg," Host-man! Host-woman! I'm having a wonderful time!
",52,42,3,10,RJ,Leo9069,Leo," You here five hours and already you tear up couch, draw moustache on priceless painting and fill pool with brine shrimp.
",122,42,3,10,Zoidberg,Zoidberg9070,Zoidberg,"  Not bad for a city boy, huh?  By the way, I took the liberty of fertilising your caviar.
",91,42,3,10,Leo,Amy9071,Amy," Just relax. I'm sure my parents will love you.
",48,42,3,10,Zoidberg,Kif9072,Kif," You don't understand. When I get nervous, I can't control my camouflage reflex.  Oh, dear!  Oh, goodness! Oh, odds and bodkins!
",129,42,3,10,Amy,Fry9073,Fry," I'll have a thorax and some feelers.
",38,42,3,10,Kif,Leo9074,Leo," You want some salad with that?
",32,42,3,10,Fry,Fry9075,Fry," Yuck!
",7,42,3,10,Leo,Amy9076,Amy," Mom? Dad? You remember Kif?
",29,42,3,10,Fry,Leo9077,Leo," This your boyfriend? I have instant dislike of him!
",53,42,3,10,Amy,Mrs. Wong9078,Mrs. Wong," He too scrawny to father grandchildren.
",41,42,3,10,Leo,Amy9079,Amy," He's not scrawny, he's just small-boned.
",42,42,3,10,Mrs. Wong,Kif9080,Kif," Actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--
",89,42,3,10,Amy,Leo9081,Leo," Yes, yes! You a big squishy wuss! Amy should be dating real man. Like him!
",76,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9082,Kif," I can be manly too. I think I'll, uh, light up a smoke.
",57,42,3,10,Leo,Amy9083,Amy,"  Wrong way!
",13,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9084,Kif,"  Smooth!
",10,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9085,Amy," Look on the bright side: My parents left after you passed out so they didn't even see you barf.
",97,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9086,Kif," Oh, now they'll never think I'm manly enough to date their daughter.
",70,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9087,Amy," It's OK, Kif.  I'll go get you a tissue from your tote.
",57,42,3,10,Kif,RJ9088,RJ," Hey there, Amy. Like you to meet my buddy, Joe.
",49,42,3,10,Amy,Joe9089,Joe," Sorry I'm late. My pool game ran long at the jazz club!
",57,42,3,10,RJ,RJ9090,RJ," Kids love him!
",16,42,3,10,Joe,Fry9091,Fry," What's that weird sound?
",26,42,3,10,RJ,Leo9092,Leo," Dust storm! Oh, dust storm! Everybody into house. Hurry, before we die. And wipe your damn feet!
",98,42,3,10,Fry,Mrs. Wong9093,Mrs. Wong," Phew! Everyone OK? No one considering lawsuit?
",48,42,3,10,Leo,Farnsworth9094,Farnsworth," Hmm. I might have mental anguish.
",35,42,3,10,Mrs. Wong,Leo9095,Leo," I'll have you know I'm friends with every judge on planet.
",60,42,3,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth9096,Farnsworth," I'm OK then.
",14,42,3,10,Leo,Mrs. Wong9097,Mrs. Wong," Storm dying down. Leo, check if buggalo herd is OK.
",53,42,3,10,Farnsworth,Leo9098,Leo," Oh!
",5,42,3,10,Mrs. Wong,Leela9099,Leela," What happened to the buggalo?
",31,42,3,10,Leo,Leo9100,Leo," They been rustled under cover of storm. We ruined!
",52,42,3,10,Leela,Zoidberg9101,Zoidberg,"  Nooo!
",8,42,3,10,Leo,Amy9102,Amy," Don't worry, Daddy. It'll be OK.
",34,42,3,10,Zoidberg,Leo9103,Leo," Oh, really? Who gonna save us?  One-eye?  Lobster mooch?  Drunken garbage can?
",80,42,3,10,Amy,Hermes9104,Hermes," This sounds like a job for--
",30,42,3,10,Leo,Kif9105,Kif," Lieutenant Kif Kroker!
",24,42,3,10,Hermes,Hermes9106,Hermes," Alright then.
",15,42,3,10,Kif,Leo9107,Leo," Aye-ah! Those buggalo are what made Wong family so rich and powerful. Oh, Inez, with them stolen, we ruined!
",110,42,3,10,Hermes,Mrs. Wong9108,Mrs. Wong," OK. I want a divorce.
",23,42,3,10,Leo,Zoidberg9109,Zoidberg," Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!
",35,42,3,10,Mrs. Wong,Amy9110,Amy," They're not your parents, I'm not your sister and that's not your golf cart.
",78,42,3,10,Zoidberg,Zoidberg9111,Zoidberg," Aw!
",5,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9112,Amy," Everybody just calm down. Kif promised he'd catch the rustlers.
",65,42,3,10,Zoidberg,Kif9113,Kif," Mrs. Wong, do you have a neckerchief I could borrow?
",54,42,3,10,Amy,Kif9114,Kif," My plan is to take all the remaining buggalo and lead them on a rough, tough cattle drive. Then, when the rustlers attack, I'll make a citizen's arrest!
",154,42,3,10,Kif,Farnsworth9115,Farnsworth," It sounds dangerous. Someone could get killed. Fry, Leela, Bender, I want you to go with him.
",95,42,3,10,Kif,Fry9116,Fry," Aw, man!
",10,42,3,10,Farnsworth,Kif9117,Kif," Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Wong. I'll get your cattle back or die trying.
",74,42,3,10,Fry,Leo9118,Leo," Hey, we can't lose!
",21,42,3,10,Kif,Amy9119,Amy," No, Kif! It's too risky. You don't have to do this to prove your manliness.
",77,42,3,10,Leo,Mrs. Wong9120,Mrs. Wong," Oh, yes he does!
",18,42,3,10,Amy,RJ9121,RJ," Here are your mounts!
",23,42,3,10,Mrs. Wong,Leela9122,Leela," She's got a fine coat.
",24,42,3,10,RJ,Kif9123,Kif," Now, we need buggalo to lure the rustlers. How many are left?
",63,42,3,10,Leela,Amy9124,Amy," You're lookin' at her. Betsy's the only one left. She was curled up in my hamper when the storm hit.  Aw, she likes you!
",122,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9125,Kif," Saddle up, men. We got some no good rustlers to ... catch!
",60,42,3,10,Amy,Bender9126,Bender," Â : We've got a right to pick a little fight with rustlers,
Somebody wants to pick a fight with us,
He'd better bite my ass!
",125,42,3,10,Kif,Fry9127,Fry," Yee-haw!
",10,42,3,10,Bender,Leela9128,Leela," Wow, look at that: Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system.
",75,42,3,10,Fry,Fry9129,Fry," Where?
",8,42,3,10,Leela,Leela9130,Leela," Right in front of you.
",24,42,3,10,Fry,Fry9131,Fry," Oh. Oh!
",9,42,3,10,Leela,Kif9132,Kif," We'll camp near the top. The rustlers will be sure to spot us there.
",70,42,3,10,Fry,Fry9133,Fry," Where?
",8,42,3,10,Kif,Bender9134,Bender," And even though the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen. It was ... the Windows logo!
",113,42,3,10,Fry,Fry9135,Fry," Pft, that's not scary!
",24,42,3,10,Bender,Bender9136,Bender," It is if you're a laser printer.
",34,42,3,10,Fry,Leela9137,Leela," OK, my turn to tell a ghost story. Once, there was this woman driving--
",73,42,3,10,Bender,Fry9138,Fry," Hook on the hand!
",19,42,3,10,Leela,Kif9139,Kif," OK, I've got one. This family--
",33,42,3,10,Fry,Fry9140,Fry," Man in the attic!
",19,42,3,10,Kif,Leela9141,Leela," Fine, Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!
",66,42,3,10,Fry,Fry9142,Fry," With pleasure.  Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive--
",82,42,3,10,Leela,Bender9143,Bender,"  Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer!  Sorry, go on.
",63,42,3,10,Fry,Fry9144,Fry," And then, while they sat helplessly around the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding escaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant snuck up and--
",144,42,3,10,Bender,Amy9145,Amy,"  Surprise!
",12,42,3,10,Fry,Kif9146,Kif," Amy? What are you doing here?
",31,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9147,Amy," I forgot to give you something before you left.
",49,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9148,Kif," What?
",7,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9149,Amy," Is that your camouflage reflex or are you just happy to see me?
",65,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9150,Kif," I love it out here, Amy. I feel so manly. I have a blister, I-I spit! A-And of course, I tell no one my feelings.
",115,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9151,Amy," But you still have them, right?
",33,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9152,Kif," Oh, yes. But I keep them inside until I can write them in my diary.
",69,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9153,Amy," Ah, it's a wonderful night.
",29,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9154,Kif," It sure is. I could just lie here beside you staring at the sky all night.
",76,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9155,Amy," I can't!  What's that?
",24,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9156,Kif," Maybe we just made love.
",26,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9157,Amy," The buggalo! They're in the crater.
",37,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9158,Kif," The rustlers must have seen me coming and run off, scared.
",60,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9159,Amy," Oh, Kif! You're so brave!
",27,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9160,Kif,"  Sh! They'll hear us!
",23,42,3,10,Amy,Kif9161,Kif," OK, the dynamite's in place.
",30,42,3,10,Kif,Amy9162,Amy," Are you sure there's no other way to get the buggalo out?
",59,42,3,10,Kif,Leela9163,Leela," Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal.
",74,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9164,Amy," Well, actually--
",18,42,3,10,Leela,Bender9165,Bender," Too late! This is more fun!
",29,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9166,Amy," Kif! You did it! But how did you know the dynamite would work?
",64,42,3,10,Bender,Kif9167,Kif," I once took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune. The principle is essentially the same.
",101,42,3,10,Amy,Fry9168,Fry," Hey, it's that ""barbecue's over"" sound again.
",47,42,3,10,Kif,Leela9169,Leela,"  Sandstorm!  We're in the eye of the storm!
",45,42,3,10,Fry,Fry9170,Fry," Where?
",8,42,3,10,Leela,Bender9171,Bender," What's that?
",14,42,3,10,Fry,Fry9172,Fry," My God!
",9,42,3,10,Bender,Leela9173,Leela," Who are they?
",15,42,3,10,Fry,Singing Wind9174,Singing Wind," Fehk! We are the Native Martians.
",35,42,3,10,Leela,Fry9175,Fry," Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly.
",40,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Singing Wind9176,Singing Wind," Only those who revere Mother Mars can fly buggalo. And only they shall have buggalo. And they're us.
",102,42,3,10,Fry,Kif9177,Kif," But your, um, Martian-ness, these buggalo aren't yours. They belong to the Wong family.
",89,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Singing Wind9178,Singing Wind," You mean family that took all Martian land and gave us one lousy bead?
",72,42,3,10,Kif,Amy9179,Amy," Uh-huh! Amy Wong.  And you are?
",33,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Singing Wind9180,Singing Wind," Mad at Wong family! We plan to ruin them by stealing buggalo. But now we take girl instead.
",93,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9181,Amy," Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped!
",37,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Kif9182,Kif," Amy! Nooo!
",12,42,3,10,Amy,Bender9183,Bender," Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you.
",88,42,3,10,Kif,Leo9184,Leo," Hooray! You bring back cattle.
",32,42,3,10,Bender,Kif9185,Kif," Yes ... but ... I'm afraid I've got some bad news as well.
",60,42,3,10,Leo,Mrs. Wong9186,Mrs. Wong," Let Amy tell us. That way it soften the blow.  Why Amy being so quiet?
",72,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9187,Kif," Um ... well, um ... that is, um...
",36,42,3,10,Mrs. Wong,Leo9188,Leo," Oh, no! Martians kidnap Amy!  I know it them 'cause they no use good grammar.
",79,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9189,Kif," I'll get your daughter back, sir. I swear.
",44,42,3,10,Leo,Leo9190,Leo," Forget it, squishy. You the one lose her in first place. You done enough.
",75,42,3,10,Kif,Mrs. Wong9191,Mrs. Wong," Yeah. This time we get most decorated law man in the whole universe!
",70,42,3,10,Leo,Kif9192,Kif," You mean-- Oh, no, please. I beg you! Oh, for the love of--
",61,42,3,10,Mrs. Wong,Zapp9193,Zapp," I am the man with no name. Zapp Brannigan, at your service!
",61,42,3,10,Kif,Mrs. Wong9194,Mrs. Wong," Please, Mr. Brannigan, we need you go get our daughter back.
",62,42,3,10,Zapp,Zapp9195,Zapp," Very well. I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go bargain with the Martian's personally.  Your gasps intrigue me. Explain.
",122,42,3,10,Mrs. Wong,Leo9196,Leo," Martians have no land. They been gently encouraged to live on reservation deep underground. No one ever dare go there.
",120,42,3,10,Zapp,Farnsworth9197,Farnsworth," This mission is incredibly dangerous. Someone's sure to be killed. Fry, Leela, Bender--
",89,42,3,10,Leo,Bender9198,Bender," Damn you, old man!
",20,42,3,10,Farnsworth,Leela9199,Leela," Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif!
",36,42,3,10,Bender,Zapp9200,Zapp," I didn't realise you were bringing your girlfriend, lieutenant!
",65,42,3,10,Leela,Kif9201,Kif," She won't leave me alone.
",27,42,3,10,Zapp,Zapp9202,Zapp," Did I say ""girlfriend""? She sounds more like a wife!
",54,42,3,10,Kif,Zapp9203,Zapp," Behold: The Great Stone Face of Mars.
",39,42,3,10,Zapp,Fry9204,Fry," Hm.
",5,42,3,10,Zapp,Zapp9205,Zapp," The only known entrance to the Martian reservation.
",53,42,3,10,Fry,Leela9206,Leela," What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?
",41,42,3,10,Zapp,Zapp9207,Zapp," Well, yeah, but it's way over the other side of the planet.
",61,42,3,10,Leela,Zapp9208,Zapp," Nose-ward, ho!
",16,42,3,10,Zapp,Singing Wind9209,Singing Wind," Fehk! I am Singing Wind, chief of the Martian tribe.
",54,42,3,10,Zapp,Zapp9210,Zapp," Take me to your leader.
",25,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Singing Wind9211,Singing Wind," Moving along. Why you trespass on our land?
",45,42,3,10,Zapp,Zapp9212,Zapp," We come to negotiate the release of Amy Wong. And just to clarify: Land is the stuff that has sky over it.
",108,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Leela9213,Leela," They have such respect for the planet.
",40,42,3,10,Zapp,Martian #19214,Martian #1," Cynthia used to drink Slurm.
",30,42,3,10,Leela,Singing Wind9215,Singing Wind," We will give back girl when we get back planet surface.
",57,42,3,10,Martian #1,Zapp9216,Zapp," How do we even know she's alive?
",34,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Amy9217,Amy," I'm fine.
",11,42,3,10,Zapp,Zapp9218,Zapp," Sh! You're weakening our bargaining position. How about instead you give us the girl and we carve a bunch of our presidents into your sacred mountain?
",152,42,3,10,Amy,Singing Wind9219,Singing Wind," You waste words. We want return of land that was taken from us.
",65,42,3,10,Zapp,Bender9220,Bender," Uh, actually you traded it for a bead.
",40,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Singing Wind9221,Singing Wind," Tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse. We want land back!
",59,42,3,10,Bender,Zapp9222,Zapp," Chief, my people are a people of law. And that law is ...  ... no backsies!
",77,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Singing Wind9223,Singing Wind," The time for stupid statements is over!
",41,42,3,10,Zapp,Zapp9224,Zapp," Oh, boy!
",10,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Leela9225,Leela," Ow, ow, ow, ow! My eye!
",25,42,3,10,Zapp,Zoidberg9226,Zoidberg,"  Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch!
",30,42,3,10,Leela,Kif9227,Kif," Amy, no! It's too windy!  Stay calm, dearest! I'll save you!
",62,42,3,10,Zoidberg,Amy9228,Amy," Kif!  You're flying Betsy!
",28,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9229,Kif," Need a lift?
",14,42,3,10,Amy,Singing Wind9230,Singing Wind," Great Mother Mars! He has the gift!
",37,42,3,10,Kif,Leela9231,Leela," Yay, Kif!
",11,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Zapp9232,Zapp," Kroker, that was one Brannigan-esque feat of heroism!
",55,42,3,10,Leela,Singing Wind9233,Singing Wind," We have misjudged you, green one. You fly the buggalo like us. You have true reverence for Mother Mars. Let there be peace between us.
",136,42,3,10,Zapp,Martian #29234,Martian #2," Yes. Let us smoke-em peace pipe.
",34,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Kif9235,Kif," Smoke-em?
",11,42,3,10,Martian #2,Singing Wind9236,Singing Wind," Here, take.
",13,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9237,Kif," Ooh, no thanks. I'm on the peace patch.
",41,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Singing Wind9238,Singing Wind," You must smoke peace pipe, and you must do it peacefully. Or we'll kill you.
",78,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9239,Kif," Well, it's just really that I don't feel that--
",49,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Zapp9240,Zapp," Don't be such a chicken, Kif. Teenagers all smoke and they seem pretty on-the-ball.
",85,42,3,10,Kif,Fry9241,Fry," Yeah!
",7,42,3,10,Zapp,Zapp9242,Zapp," Yes, sir!
",11,42,3,10,Fry,Bender9243,Bender," Way to suck it!
",17,42,3,10,Zapp,Kif9244,Kif," Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest!  Oh, monkey trumpets!
",59,42,3,10,Bender,Singing Wind9245,Singing Wind," You have coughed at our offer of peace. So you must die!
",58,42,3,10,Kif,Martian #39246,Martian #3," The very bead used to crush our dreams shall be used to crush your bones.
",75,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Kif9247,Kif," Well, actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--
",95,42,3,10,Martian #3,Fry9248,Fry," Wait. That's the bead you traded your land for?
",49,42,3,10,Kif,Leela9249,Leela," It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune.
",62,42,3,10,Fry,Singing Wind9250,Singing Wind," Really?
",9,42,3,10,Leela,Bender9251,Bender," Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!
",59,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Amy9252,Amy," Y'know, if you still want your land, we could just trade back for it.
",71,42,3,10,Bender,Singing Wind9253,Singing Wind," Hmm. We always thought bead was worthless. We assumed our ancestors were cheated because they not have concept of ownership.
",126,42,3,10,Amy,Bender9254,Bender," So we can have the diamond?
",29,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Singing Wind9255,Singing Wind," No. We do have concept of ownership. You are free to go. Sorry about all the rustling and kidnapping.
",103,42,3,10,Bender,Leela9256,Leela," But what about your sacred land?
",34,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Singing Wind9257,Singing Wind," Land shmand! We don't wanna live on this planet. It's a dump. We'll buy new planet and act like it's sacred. With cash like this, who's going to argue? Nobody, that's who!
",173,42,3,10,Leela,Amy9258,Amy," Then Kif flew Betsy, rescued me from the tornado and made peace with the Martians.
",84,42,3,10,Singing Wind,Leo9259,Leo," Please! He too much of a wimp.
",32,42,3,10,Amy,Mrs. Wong9260,Mrs. Wong," Yeah. I'm sure it was all Mr. Zapp Brannigan here.
",52,42,3,10,Leo,Zapp9261,Zapp," Please, you give me too little credit.
",40,42,3,10,Mrs. Wong,Zoidberg9262,Zoidberg," Captain Brannigan, you're always welcome here at Rancho Zoidberg!
",67,42,3,10,Zapp,Zoidberg9263,Zoidberg," Money doesn't make good people, no, siree!
",44,42,3,10,Zoidberg,Amy9264,Amy," Thanks for saving my life, Kif. You're my hero.
",49,42,3,10,Zoidberg,Kif9265,Kif," Oh, you're kind. But your parents still don't like me.
",56,42,3,10,Amy,Amy9266,Amy," Well globviously! But if they liked you then I wouldn't. Don't you know anything about girls?
",95,42,3,10,Kif,Kif9267,Kif,"  Dear diary, I just made love for the second time!
",52,42,3,10,Amy,Announcer #19268,Announcer #1,"  Futurama is brought to you by ...  ... Thompson's Teeth: The only teeth strong enough to eat other teeth.
",108,43,3,11,Kif,Farnsworth9269,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Today marks our dear friend Dr. Zoidberg's 10th year with Planet Express. Huzzahs are in order.
",118,43,3,11,Announcer #1,Fry9270,Fry,"  Huzzah!
",10,43,3,11,Farnsworth,Leela9271,Leela,"  Huzzah!
",10,43,3,11,Fry,Amy9272,Amy,"  Huzzah!
",10,43,3,11,Leela,Zoidberg9273,Zoidberg," Hooray for me! Hooray for Zoidberg!
",37,43,3,11,Amy,Hermes9274,Hermes," I will now read the mandatory speech.   Dear employee. Has it really been five, 10 or 15 years? If not, please disregard this and get back to work. Distribute token of appreciation and applaud.
",195,43,3,11,Zoidberg,Zoidberg9275,Zoidberg," Look! Coupons! I can get two oil changes for the price of one! Now if I could only afford the one ... and the car. Ah, the years! So many memories, so many strange fluids gushing out of patients' bodies--
",206,43,3,11,Hermes,Hermes9276,Hermes," Yes, yes. Now here's your pension statement.  It's empty because you haven't paid into it, you dumb stinkbug!
",111,43,3,11,Zoidberg,Zoidberg9277,Zoidberg," You kept track of it all these years!
",39,43,3,11,Hermes,Fry9278,Fry," Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?
",88,43,3,11,Zoidberg,Bender9279,Bender," I thought you were retired.
",29,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9280,Fry," Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age.
",49,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9281,Bender," I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to ""off"".
",56,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9282,Fry," Well I'm gonna take action. It's time to check on my retirement fund.  Damn! Still only $100.
",95,43,3,11,Bender,Franklin9283,Franklin,"  A penny saved is a penny earned. Also, could you get some athlete's foot cream for my face?
",94,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9284,Fry," He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely.
",48,43,3,11,Franklin,Fry9285,Fry," Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket.  Cherry.  Cherry!  Mule. Crud!
",74,43,3,11,Fry,Bender9286,Bender," So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles.
",70,43,3,11,Fry,Teller9287,Teller," You're opening a retirement account for $6? I'm sure a wealthy ...  ... mule farmer like yourself is aware that we charge a $10 monthly fee.
",142,43,3,11,Bender,Fry9288,Fry,"  You gotta spend money to make money.
",39,43,3,11,Teller,Teller9289,Teller," Here you are, sir. Your account is now overdrawn by $4.
",57,43,3,11,Fry,Robot #19290,Robot #1," Gee, I've seen lines move faster in a sperm bank.
",51,43,3,11,Teller,Bender9291,Bender," That's for sure--  Roberto! Is that you?
",42,43,3,11,Robot #1,Roberto9292,Roberto," Bender! Hey, man!
",19,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9293,Bender," You old lunatic! How you been?
",32,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9294,Roberto," Not bad, not bad.  Everybody on the floor! This is a stick-up!
",64,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9295,Bender," Yeah, I'm doing OK too.  I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex.
",84,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9296,Roberto," Cool. Ca-Can you give me a hand here?
",39,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9297,Bender," Sure thing, pal.
",18,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9298,Roberto," Hey, you! Red!  Quit watering that plant and get the door!
",60,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9299,Bender," Well, nice talking to you.
",28,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9300,Roberto," Same here.  You guys are alright! Here's something for your trouble.
",70,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9301,Bender," Hey, thanks, buddy!
",21,43,3,11,Roberto,Smitty9302,Smitty," Freeze, punks! You're under arrest!
",37,43,3,11,Bender,Nixon9303,Nixon,"  Shoot them in the back! Quick! While they're not looking!
",60,43,3,11,Smitty,Bailiff9304,Bailiff," Court is in session. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding.
",61,43,3,11,Nixon,Whitey9305,Whitey," The charge is bank robbery. Now, my caddie chauffeur informs me that a bank is a place where people put money that isn't properly invested. Therefore, robbing a bank is tantamount to that most heinous of crimes, theft of money.
",229,43,3,11,Bailiff,Hyper-Chicken9306,Hyper-Chicken," As the surveillance camera for the bank what all the judge was a-jawing about, could y'all tell us what you done seen the day of the crime?
",141,43,3,11,Whitey,Camera9307,Camera," Well, let's see. My memory's a little fuzzy, but it went exactly like this:
",77,43,3,11,Hyper-Chicken,Hyper-Chicken9308,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, I move that I be disbarred for introducing this evidence against my own clients.
",95,43,3,11,Camera,Hyper-Chicken9309,Hyper-Chicken," Mr. Fry, do you recognise the robot a-huggin' on you in this here hologram?
",77,43,3,11,Hyper-Chicken,Fry9310,Fry," I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as long as I live. And that name is--
",104,43,3,11,Hyper-Chicken,Leela9311,Leela,"  Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!
",66,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9312,Fry," You're right. You're right. It was--
",38,43,3,11,Leela,Whitey9313,Whitey," Yes? What? You say if I testify I'll be killed? Oh. It's for you.
",67,43,3,11,Fry,Roberto9314,Roberto,"  ...and the other hamburger will...
",37,43,3,11,Whitey,Roberto9315,Roberto," ...also be made of your lungs. So long, pal.
",46,43,3,11,Roberto,Fry9316,Fry," I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patty.
",84,43,3,11,Roberto,Whitey9317,Whitey," Ah, the 67th Amendment.
",25,43,3,11,Fry,Hyper-Chicken9318,Hyper-Chicken," I may be a simple country Hyper-Chicken but I know when we're finger-licked. Whattya say we plead insanity?
",109,43,3,11,Whitey,Bender9319,Bender," A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.
",72,43,3,11,Hyper-Chicken,Hyper-Chicken9320,Hyper-Chicken," If you start now, it might help our case.
",43,43,3,11,Bender,Whitey9321,Whitey," Counselor, what evidence do you offer to support this new plea of insanity?
",77,43,3,11,Hyper-Chicken,Hyper-Chicken9322,Hyper-Chicken," Well, for one, they done hired me to represent them.
",54,43,3,11,Whitey,Whitey9323,Whitey," Insanity plea is accepted. Mr. Bender, I hereby commit you to the asylum for criminally insane robots until such time as you are deemed cured.
",144,43,3,11,Hyper-Chicken,Bender9324,Bender," Yahoo! The system fails again!
",32,43,3,11,Whitey,Whitey9325,Whitey," And, Mr. Fry, I sentence you to the home for criminally insane humans.
",72,43,3,11,Bender,Bailiff9326,Bailiff," Your Honour, that facility has been full ever since you ruled that being poor is a mental illness.
",100,43,3,11,Whitey,Whitey9327,Whitey,"  Order! Order! The only poor people I want to hear about are the people who tend to my pores at the spa. Just send them both to the robot loony bin and let's go.
",163,43,3,11,Bailiff,Fry9328,Fry,"  Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!
",54,43,3,11,Whitey,Farnsworth9329,Farnsworth," Keep your chin up!
",20,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9330,Fry,"  Ow! My chin!
",15,43,3,11,Farnsworth,Fry9331,Fry," I don't belong here, Bender. This is an asylum for insane robots!
",67,43,3,11,Fry,Bender9332,Bender," Well, you meet half the qualifications.
",41,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9333,Fry," Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine my fragile, naked, pink body, they'll see I'm not a--
",95,43,3,11,Bender,Fry9334,Fry," What the--
",12,43,3,11,Fry,Bender9335,Bender,"  I find that offensive!
",25,43,3,11,Fry,Dr. Perceptron9336,Dr. Perceptron," Greetings. I am Dr. Perceptron. Let me give you something to help you relax.
",78,43,3,11,Bender,Fry9337,Fry," Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See?  I'm all squishy and flabby. Also, I complain a lot.
",117,43,3,11,Dr. Perceptron,Dr. Perceptron9338,Dr. Perceptron," Yes, you do. You need to relax more.  Terrific. Now, consider the following: You were admitted to this robot asylum. Therefore, you must be a robot. Diagnosis complete.
",170,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9339,Fry," I do other human stuff! I age! See?
",37,43,3,11,Dr. Perceptron,Nurse Ratchet9340,Nurse Ratchet," I'm Nurse Ratchet. Please come with me, won't you?
",52,43,3,11,Fry,Nurse Ratchet9341,Nurse Ratchet," We'll meet your roommate next, shall we? His name is Malfunctioning Eddie.
",76,43,3,11,Nurse Ratchet,Fry9342,Fry," The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices really were insane.
",61,43,3,11,Nurse Ratchet,Nurse Ratchet9343,Nurse Ratchet," He's very excitable.  So don't say anything to surprise him.
",62,43,3,11,Fry,Malfunctioning Eddie9344,Malfunctioning Eddie," Pleased to meet you.
",22,43,3,11,Nurse Ratchet,Fry9345,Fry,"  Actually, we've met once before.
",35,43,3,11,Malfunctioning Eddie,Malfunctioning Eddie9346,Malfunctioning Eddie," What?
",7,43,3,11,Fry,Hairbot9347,Hairbot," I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl.
",58,43,3,11,Malfunctioning Eddie,Bender9348,Bender," Whoa! Someone had a busy day.
",31,43,3,11,Hairbot,Fry9349,Fry," My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm human?
",81,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9350,Bender," You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.
",39,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9351,Fry," I don't wanna!
",16,43,3,11,Bender,Unit 39352,Unit 3," Hey, man. I believe you're a human.
",37,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9353,Fry," You do?
",9,43,3,11,Unit 3,Unit 39354,Unit 3," Sure. They don't believe I'm a human either. Name's Unit 2013. C'mon. Lemme introduce you around.  Fry, meet Norm. How's it going, pal? Still picking up transmissions from the CIA on your teeth?
",196,43,3,11,Fry,Norm9355,Norm," They just won't stop!
",23,43,3,11,Unit 3,Woman #19356,Woman #1,"  The CIA cafeteria menu for the week of May 15th is as follows: Monday, shepherd's pie. Tu--
",94,43,3,11,Norm,Unit 39357,Unit 3,"  Cuckoo!
",10,43,3,11,Woman #1,Fry9358,Fry," Let me guess, he thinks he's Lincoln?
",39,43,3,11,Unit 3,Unit 39359,Unit 3," Well, he's supposed to. Problem is he's got multiple personalities -- all of them Lincoln.
",92,43,3,11,Fry,Lincolnbot9360,Lincolnbot," I was born in 200 log cabins.
",31,43,3,11,Unit 3,Unit 39361,Unit 3," And this here is Frankie. He's convinced he's a lunchroom worker, so they put him to work in the lunchroom.  How is work in the lunchroom, Frankie?
",149,43,3,11,Lincolnbot,Frankie9362,Frankie,"  It's alright.
",16,43,3,11,Unit 3,Unit 39363,Unit 3," Poor Frankie!
",15,43,3,11,Frankie,Mad Hatterbot9364,Mad Hatterbot," Change places!
",16,43,3,11,Unit 3,Fry9365,Fry," Bender, I can't take much more of this! I want outta here!
",60,43,3,11,Mad Hatterbot,Bender9366,Bender," Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it, two Lincolns for every Napoleon.  Ah! Sweet light crude!
",129,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9367,Fry," But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos -- and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die here!
",168,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9368,Bender," Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot.
",53,43,3,11,Fry,Mad Hatterbot9369,Mad Hatterbot," Change places!
",16,43,3,11,Bender,Victor9370,Victor," The doctor says you are making great strides with your exploding problem.
",75,43,3,11,Mad Hatterbot,Malfunctioning Eddie9371,Malfunctioning Eddie," Well, the way I see it--
",26,43,3,11,Victor,Fry9372,Fry," You gotta get me out of here. I would have starved to death if not for that sick vending machine robot.  Gimme! Gimme!
",120,43,3,11,Malfunctioning Eddie,Hermes9373,Hermes," Poor Fry! He's got the munchies for freedom!
",46,43,3,11,Fry,Leela9374,Leela," We're all trying to help you. We've petitioned the governor but he doesn't want to appear soft on people who've been falsely imprisoned.
",138,43,3,11,Hermes,Fry9375,Fry," At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all.
",71,43,3,11,Leela,Bender9376,Bender," Je suis Napoleon!  No, seriously, I'm not.
",44,43,3,11,Fry,Amy9377,Amy," Bender! You should be more ashamed of yourself than usual.
",60,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9378,Bender," Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time using humour.
",86,43,3,11,Amy,Nurse Ratchet9379,Nurse Ratchet," Visiting hours are over. Time for our medication disks.
",57,43,3,11,Bender,Fry9380,Fry,"  Help me! For God's sake, help me!
",36,43,3,11,Nurse Ratchet,Farnsworth9381,Farnsworth," Oh, don't worry, Fry. I too once spent a nightmare-ish time in a robot asylum. But now it's nearly over. So long.
",115,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9382,Fry,"  Thirty days hath September, April, June and ... wonder ... is that peanut butter ... what am I gonna do?   Oh, God! What? What? What is it now?
",146,43,3,11,Farnsworth,Dr. Perceptron9383,Dr. Perceptron," You are being released.
",25,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9384,Fry," Finally! Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy justice!
",47,43,3,11,Dr. Perceptron,Dr. Perceptron9385,Dr. Perceptron," Not you. Him.
",15,43,3,11,Fry,Malfunctioning Eddie9386,Malfunctioning Eddie," Me? What a surprise.  Look!
",29,43,3,11,Dr. Perceptron,Malfunctioning Eddie9387,Malfunctioning Eddie," I barely exploded at all.
",27,43,3,11,Malfunctioning Eddie,Dr. Perceptron9388,Dr. Perceptron," We can control that with medication.
",38,43,3,11,Malfunctioning Eddie,Nurse Ratchet9389,Nurse Ratchet," Fry? Are we ready to meet our new roommate?
",45,43,3,11,Dr. Perceptron,Roberto9390,Roberto," Hi, Red!
",10,43,3,11,Nurse Ratchet,Fry9391,Fry," Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?
",41,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9392,Roberto," I got busted robbing that bank again.
",39,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9393,Fry,"  Why would you hold up the same bank twice?
",45,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9394,Roberto," Ah, that first time was just to case the joint and rob it a little.  What's the matter? You scared?
",101,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9395,Fry," N-- N-- N--
",13,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9396,Roberto," Noticeably? I'll say! Now stand back, I gotta practise my stabbing.
",69,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9397,Fry," No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!
",36,43,3,11,Roberto,Bender9398,Bender,"  Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!
",51,43,3,11,Fry,Roberto9399,Roberto," Jeez, Red. Quit cowering. You call yourself a robot?
",54,43,3,11,Bender,Fry9400,Fry," I'm not a robot!  I'm not a robot!
",36,43,3,11,Roberto,Dr. Perceptron9401,Dr. Perceptron," In answer to your question, Hermes, yes, your friend is cured.
",64,43,3,11,Fry,Hermes9402,Hermes," Oh!
",5,43,3,11,Dr. Perceptron,Farnsworth9403,Farnsworth," What a relief!
",16,43,3,11,Hermes,Leela9404,Leela," Thank God!
",12,43,3,11,Farnsworth,Dr. Perceptron9405,Dr. Perceptron," You'll notice he no longer suffers delusions of humanity.
",59,43,3,11,Leela,Fry9406,Fry,"  Affirmative. I feel nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep ...
",66,43,3,11,Dr. Perceptron,Leela9407,Leela," You've made a terrible mistake. He's a human being, not a machine. Oh, Fry!
",77,43,3,11,Fry,Bender9408,Bender,"  Gonna sing a little tale about a battle called Waterloo.  Bonjour, y'all!
",76,43,3,11,Leela,Zoidberg9409,Zoidberg," Listen to me, Fry. Just because you think you're a robot, doesn't make you a robot. After all, I think I'm a doctor but that doesn't make me a doctor. These fancy clothes do!
",176,43,3,11,Bender,Fry9410,Fry,"  Negative. I must be a robot. Why else would human women refuse to date me?
",77,43,3,11,Zoidberg,Leela9411,Leela," Oh, lots of reasons.
",22,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9412,Fry,"  Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment.
",100,43,3,11,Leela,Bender9413,Bender," Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!
",33,43,3,11,Fry,Commentator9414,Commentator,"  And down the stretch, it's Daddy's Little Grandpa, followed by Perennial Loser, and bringing up the rear, it's Lasty!
",120,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9415,Bender," Come on, Lasty!
",17,43,3,11,Commentator,Roberto9416,Roberto," Hey, Bender.
",14,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9417,Bender," Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do you?
",162,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9418,Roberto," Yeah, yeah. Now lie down and play dead. And don't ham it up!
",62,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9419,Bender," Uh, sure.  Anything for you, buddy.
",37,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9420,Roberto," Wait here, Bender. I need to get a disguise.
",46,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9421,Bender," Uh, what's with the get-up?
",29,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9422,Roberto," I'm in disguise 'cause I'm thinking of escaping. You in? Or do I gotta kill you so you don't squeal?
",102,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9423,Bender," I'm in! I'm in!  So when were you planning the breakout?
",58,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9424,Roberto," I'm thinking maybe a few seconds ago.
",39,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9425,Bender," Quick! Let's keep escaping!
",29,43,3,11,Roberto,Hermes9426,Hermes," Times two, carry the one...
",29,43,3,11,Bender,Fry9427,Fry," Oh, you sad, worthless human.
",31,43,3,11,Hermes,Hermes9428,Hermes," What are ya-- Sacred hog of Prague! That was my anniversary gift to LaBarbara!
",80,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9429,Fry," Fear not! For I shall assist ye!
",34,43,3,11,Hermes,Hermes9430,Hermes," Robots don't say ""ye""!
",24,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9431,Fry," Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs.  What is the meaning of this symbol?
",108,43,3,11,Hermes,Hermes9432,Hermes," That's a plus sign, you pointy-haired loony! Quit thinking you're a robot!
",76,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9433,Fry," I'll show ye!
",15,43,3,11,Hermes,Fry9434,Fry," Stand back. I'm a tool-bot.
",29,43,3,11,Fry,Leela9435,Leela," You're not a tool-bot. You're not a food-motron. You're not a robot of any kind.
",82,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9436,Fry," Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet.
",65,43,3,11,Leela,Leela9437,Leela," OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
",92,43,3,11,Fry,Farnsworth9438,Farnsworth," You're going to do his laundry?
",33,43,3,11,Leela,Leela9439,Leela,"  Fry, this is for you.
",24,43,3,11,Farnsworth,Fry9440,Fry," Beep.
",7,43,3,11,Leela,Leela9441,Leela," Oh, for God's sake!
",21,43,3,11,Fry,Zoidberg9442,Zoidberg," By a scallop's forelocks! What's with all the beer, Fry?
",58,43,3,11,Leela,Fry9443,Fry,"  Alcohol fuels my power cells.  And as a mighty robot, I--  Beep.
",67,43,3,11,Zoidberg,Roberto9444,Roberto," Thanks for helping me escape, Bender.
",39,43,3,11,Fry,Bender9445,Bender," Oh, it was nothing.
",21,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9446,Roberto,"  It was not nothing!  I wanna repay you. Let me get you something in here.
",76,43,3,11,Bender,Roberto9447,Roberto,"  Hands up! This is a stick-up again!
",38,43,3,11,Roberto,Bender9448,Bender," Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto.
",72,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9449,Roberto," Gimme the remaining dough. And the calendars ... and that pen. Try to tear it so most of the beads are on my end!
",115,43,3,11,Bender,URL9450,URL," Police! You're busted!
",24,43,3,11,Roberto,Smitty9451,Smitty," And don't try anything. This glass here is laser-proof.  Fire lasers!  Duck! Lasers!
",86,43,3,11,URL,Bender9452,Bender," Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.
",59,43,3,11,Smitty,Amy9453,Amy," Aw! He looks like a little insane drunken angel.
",50,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9454,Bender,"  Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto.
",45,43,3,11,Amy,Hermes9455,Hermes," Hey, mon.
",11,43,3,11,Bender,Roberto9456,Roberto," Nice to meet you.
",19,43,3,11,Hermes,Smitty9457,Smitty,"  Come out with your hands up.
",31,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9458,Roberto,"  Hostages!
",12,43,3,11,Smitty,Roberto9459,Roberto," Back off! I got hostages!
",27,43,3,11,Roberto,Zoidberg9460,Zoidberg," Hooray! I'm helping!
",22,43,3,11,Roberto,Smitty9461,Smitty,"  Do you have any better hostages?
",35,43,3,11,Zoidberg,Roberto9462,Roberto," To show them who's crazy, I'm gonna execute some of you. How 'bout you?
",73,43,3,11,Smitty,Farnsworth9463,Farnsworth," Ouch! That's going to bleed when my heart beats.
",50,43,3,11,Roberto,Leela9464,Leela," Wait! Take me first!
",22,43,3,11,Farnsworth,Bender9465,Bender," Yes! Take her first.

",42,43,3,11,Bender,Zoidberg9467,Zoidberg," Oh, the fear!
",15,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9468,Roberto," I'm thinking of a number between one and ten. Guess it and you die first. Go!
",79,43,3,11,Zoidberg,Bender9469,Bender," Um ... OK. Fifty ... six ... ish?
",35,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9470,Roberto," 56? 56? Oh, man! Now that's all I can think about! I'm gonna kill you, you ... no good ... 56-ing--

",21,43,3,11,Bender,Roberto9473,Roberto," Hey, Red. You're just in time to join the hostage situation. Which side you wanna be on?
",90,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9474,Fry," The side that kicks your twisted, metal ass!
",46,43,3,11,Roberto,Leela9475,Leela," Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful.
",36,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9476,Fry," Negative, bossy meat creature. I know now what my primary function is: I am a battle-droid. Sworn to protect the weak from crazy robots.
",138,43,3,11,Leela,Roberto9477,Roberto," I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy! I'm just not user-friendly!
",65,43,3,11,Fry,Hermes9478,Hermes," Fry! Don't be a hero! It's not covered by the health plan!
",60,43,3,11,Roberto,Roberto9479,Roberto," Let's see how much of a robot you really are!
",47,43,3,11,Hermes,Fry9480,Fry," No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armour.

",43,43,3,11,Roberto,URL9483,URL," Hey, baby. Wash that off before you put it back.

",18,43,3,11,Zoidberg,Bender9488,Bender," Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race.
",53,43,3,11,Leela,Fry9489,Fry,"  It was nothing. I--   Blood? Robots don't have blood. I must be a, a--
",73,43,3,11,Bender,Zoidberg9490,Zoidberg," A squid?
",10,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9491,Fry," A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!
",35,43,3,11,Zoidberg,Zoidberg9492,Zoidberg," Also good.
",12,43,3,11,Fry,Leela9493,Leela," Thanks for saving us, Fry.
",28,43,3,11,Zoidberg,Fry9494,Fry," I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again.

",88,43,3,11,Fry,Fry9496,Fry," Aw. Thanks, Bender.
",21,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9497,Bender," Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human.  What?
",60,43,3,11,Fry,Bender9498,Bender,"  What?
",8,43,3,11,Bender,Bender9499,Bender," Ah, beer! So many choices, and it makes so little difference.
",63,44,3,12,Bender,Fry9500,Fry," How 'bout LÃ¶brau? It has dots on it.
",38,44,3,12,Bender,Bender9501,Bender," Overruled. The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot!
",57,44,3,12,Fry,Fry9502,Fry," I can't drink that! The metal shavings make my throat bloody.
",63,44,3,12,Bender,Bender9503,Bender," Baby wants a Zima!
",20,44,3,12,Fry,Leela9504,Leela," Hey, hey! We can all fight when we're drunk. Now, listen, why don't we just brew our own beer?
",96,44,3,12,Bender,Bender9505,Bender," You can brew your own beer?
",29,44,3,12,Leela,Leela9506,Leela," Sure. The kids at the orphanarium used to do it all the time.
",63,44,3,12,Bender,Hermes9507,Hermes," Cursed bacteria of Liberia. My own son, suspended from boarding school.
",73,44,3,12,Leela,Dwight9508,Dwight," It's not my fault, Dad.
",25,44,3,12,Hermes,Farnsworth9509,Farnsworth," And you, Cubert! I cloned you from one of my warts and I can send you straight back in there.
",95,44,3,12,Dwight,Cubert9510,Cubert," Nuh-uh!
",9,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Zoidberg9511,Zoidberg," What's going on? Is this angry yelling or busted-hearing-aid yelling?
",71,44,3,12,Cubert,Hermes9512,Hermes," I'm afraid it's both.
",23,44,3,12,Zoidberg,Farnsworth9513,Farnsworth,"  What?
",8,44,3,12,Hermes,Labarbara9514,Labarbara," Now hold on. Everyone, cool your daiquiris! Let's give the little vermin a chance to explain themselves.
",106,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Dwight9515,Dwight," It was self defence, Mom. Just look at this letter the principal sent.  We were in science class and we had just finished building a miniature black hole.
",156,44,3,12,Labarbara,Cubert9516,Cubert,"  That was easy.
",17,44,3,12,Dwight,Brett9517,Brett,"  Pretty scrawny black hole. It must be hungry.
",48,44,3,12,Cubert,Cubert9518,Cubert,"  Duh! Black holes don't need food.
",36,44,3,12,Brett,Brett9519,Brett,"  Neither do nerds!
",20,44,3,12,Cubert,Dwight9520,Dwight,"  My Manwich!
",14,44,3,12,Brett,Cubert9521,Cubert,"  That's it, Bret. You've compressed our lunches to a singularity for the last time! Salt him, Dwight!
",103,44,3,12,Dwight,Brett9522,Brett,"  When I re-solidify, I'm gonna put you in a world of goop!
",60,44,3,12,Cubert,Cubert9523,Cubert," See? That bully started it. We couldn't fight back with brawn so we used our brains!
",86,44,3,12,Brett,Farnsworth9524,Farnsworth," I've warned you not to use those things!
",42,44,3,12,Cubert,Leela9525,Leela," Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops. We just need a big disposable tub to mix it in.
",90,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Bender9526,Bender," Yo!
",5,44,3,12,Leela,Leela9527,Leela," Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.
",42,44,3,12,Bender,Hermes9528,Hermes," Dwight, you remember the crew.
",32,44,3,12,Leela,Dwight9529,Dwight,"  Eh.
",6,44,3,12,Hermes,Farnsworth9530,Farnsworth," Crew, you remember Cubert?  Wonderful! Then I'm sure you won't mind being their legal guardians for a month!
",110,44,3,12,Dwight,Cubert9531,Cubert," Well, well.  If it isn't my old friend, stretch pants ...  ... no pants and ...  ... idiot!
",93,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Bender9532,Bender," We're making beer. I'm the brewery.
",37,44,3,12,Cubert,Dwight9533,Dwight," I heard alcohol makes you stupid.
",35,44,3,12,Bender,Fry9534,Fry," No I'm ... doesn't.
",21,44,3,12,Dwight,Leela9535,Leela," Actually, Dwight, you're right. Alcohol is very, very bad ... for children. But once you turn 21 it becomes very, very good. So scram!
",136,44,3,12,Fry,Dwight9536,Dwight," Aw, man!
",10,44,3,12,Leela,Cubert9537,Cubert," I'm sick of this.
",19,44,3,12,Dwight,Cubert9538,Cubert," Hey, Dad. What useless contraption are you half-baking today?
",63,44,3,12,Cubert,Farnsworth9539,Farnsworth," Eh, wha? Oh! This is my latest invention; a device that lets anyone sound exactly like me!
",92,44,3,12,Cubert,Cubert9540,Cubert,"  Good news, everyone! I'm a horse's butt!
",43,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth9541,Farnsworth," I am? That's not good news at all, you little--
",49,44,3,12,Cubert,Dwight9542,Dwight," What's this devices marketability? Who's the target consumer?
",63,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth9543,Farnsworth," There is no target consumer! Only targets. Targets that will tremble in fear as their new master hands down edicts in my glorious, booming voice!  Now quit pestering me, you scoundrels!
",187,44,3,12,Dwight,Hermes9544,Hermes,"  Stamp it, file it. Oh, yeah! Send it overnight!
",50,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Dwight9545,Dwight," Can I collate that?
",21,44,3,12,Hermes,Hermes9546,Hermes," No!
",5,44,3,12,Dwight,Cubert9547,Cubert," Can I shred these contracts?
",30,44,3,12,Hermes,Hermes9548,Hermes," No!
",5,44,3,12,Cubert,Dwight9549,Dwight," Wow! A power-stamper!
",23,44,3,12,Hermes,Hermes9550,Hermes," Now look at all the work I gotta do!  Ow!
",43,44,3,12,Dwight,Leela9551,Leela," Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your natural robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast.
",119,44,3,12,Hermes,Bender9552,Bender," Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me?  It's so beautiful.
",77,44,3,12,Leela,Leela9553,Leela," Talk to me.
",13,44,3,12,Bender,Farnsworth9554,Farnsworth,"  This is Professor Farnsworth. I have an important delivery for you and your dumb crew. You must deliver a pizza to Dogdoo 8, a planet at the edge of the universe.
",165,44,3,12,Leela,Cubert9555,Cubert,"  Sorry I can't come down to say goodbye, but I'm busy inventing useless junk.
",79,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Dwight9556,Dwight,"  And I smell bad.
",19,44,3,12,Cubert,Cubert9557,Cubert," Hey!
",6,44,3,12,Dwight,Leela9558,Leela," If you were my kids, you'd get quite a talking to ... from your father ... when he got home from the Senate.
",110,44,3,12,Cubert,Farnsworth9559,Farnsworth," Oh, bother! What have they done now?
",38,44,3,12,Leela,Bender9560,Bender," Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake pizza delivery.
",56,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Fry9561,Fry," The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7.
",73,44,3,12,Bender,Hermes9562,Hermes," Child man, is this true?
",26,44,3,12,Fry,Dwight9563,Dwight," Yeah, but why are you mad at us? Your dummy brigade wasted a week on an obviously fake mission.
",97,44,3,12,Hermes,Cubert9564,Cubert,"  Plus, they're making bootleg beer inside company property!
",61,44,3,12,Dwight,Bender9565,Bender,"  Lies! Lies and slander!
",26,44,3,12,Cubert,Farnsworth9566,Farnsworth," Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys have been underfoot long enough!
",103,44,3,12,Bender,Hermes9567,Hermes," You jerked the words right outta my mouth. We're their fathers and it's high times we acted like it.
",102,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Bender9568,Bender," Ooh-hoo! Here comes violence!
",31,44,3,12,Hermes,Hermes9569,Hermes," Get a job, you lazy kids!
",27,44,3,12,Bender,Bender9570,Bender," I guess if you want children beaten ...  ... you have to do it yourself.
",74,44,3,12,Hermes,Cubert9571,Cubert," Come on, Dad, shuffle faster!
",31,44,3,12,Bender,Dwight9572,Dwight," You don't wanna miss the unveiling of our new company, do you?
",64,44,3,12,Cubert,Hermes9573,Hermes," Company?  How cute! What will you be pedalling? Lemonade? Shoe shines? Cootie insurance?
",90,44,3,12,Dwight,Farnsworth9574,Farnsworth," Perhaps they've constructed a teddy bear hospital!
",52,44,3,12,Hermes,Cubert9575,Cubert," Actually, we're starting a competing delivery company.
",56,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Hermes9576,Hermes," Welcome to the world of business!
",35,44,3,12,Cubert,Farnsworth9577,Farnsworth," Who's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign? Nobody, that's who!
",79,44,3,12,Hermes,Dwight9578,Dwight," But we already have a client signed up. We're delivering the Daily Supernova.
",79,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Hermes9579,Hermes," So your delivery company is just a cute, harmless paper route?
",64,44,3,12,Dwight,Farnsworth9580,Farnsworth," Phew!
",7,44,3,12,Hermes,Dwight9581,Dwight," No! It's a serious business.
",30,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth9582,Farnsworth," Yes it's a tremendous responsibility, alright!  What if a paper were to land in a puddle?
",91,44,3,12,Dwight,Hermes9583,Hermes," Civilisation as we know it might get splashed!
",48,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Dwight9584,Dwight," Why do they always treat us like dumb kids? We're practically old enough to find the Fox Network infantile!
",109,44,3,12,Hermes,Cubert9585,Cubert," We'll show 'em. All Awesome Express needs is a sturdy interstellar delivery craft.  VoilÃ ! You got a quarter?
",111,44,3,12,Dwight,Dwight9586,Dwight," Man, the ad said to allow four to six seconds for delivery.
",61,44,3,12,Cubert,Cubert9587,Cubert," More like seven!
",18,44,3,12,Dwight,Bender9588,Bender," I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.
",68,44,3,12,Cubert,Fry9589,Fry," No, you have a healthy glow.
",30,44,3,12,Bender,Bender9590,Bender," Oh, my God! I just felt it ferment!
",37,44,3,12,Fry,Leela9591,Leela," Ooh! Let me feel.  Have you thought about what to name it?
",60,44,3,12,Bender,Bender9592,Bender," I was thinking ""Benderbrau"" if it's an ale, ""Botweiser"" if it's a lager.
",74,44,3,12,Leela,Fry9593,Fry," I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game.  Ooh, I felt that one!
",77,44,3,12,Bender,Cubert9594,Cubert," Uh, there's a crack in the hull here. That could cause explosive decompression.
",81,44,3,12,Fry,Dwight9595,Dwight," Put a sticker on it.
",22,44,3,12,Cubert,Hermes9596,Hermes," Off on your first delivery, eh? You be careful, my little tinkler.  Remember we used to call you that, huh? Tinkler?
",118,44,3,12,Dwight,Sal9597,Sal," Gets movin'! Those newspapers won'ts deliver themselveses! Only the Sunday edition can dos that.
",98,44,3,12,Hermes,Farnsworth9598,Farnsworth," Goodness, there must be 50 papers in that bundle! That's a big number, 50.
",76,44,3,12,Sal,Cubert9599,Cubert," Yeah, if you're an idiot!
",27,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Dwight9600,Dwight," Three, two, one.
",18,44,3,12,Cubert,Cubert9601,Cubert," All systems go.
",17,44,3,12,Dwight,Dwight9602,Dwight," Blast-off!
",12,44,3,12,Cubert,Hermes9603,Hermes,"  See you at din-din!
",22,44,3,12,Dwight,Farnsworth9604,Farnsworth,"  I'm blowing you a kiss.
",26,44,3,12,Hermes,Cubert9605,Cubert," Take evasive action!
",22,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth9606,Farnsworth,"  It's closing in! You can't avoid it! It's a cheek-seeker. And ... gotcha!
",76,44,3,12,Cubert,Cubert9607,Cubert,"  Nooo!
",8,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Hermes9608,Hermes," Business is down, so I filed papers to have you all reclassified as slaves.
",77,44,3,12,Cubert,Farnsworth9609,Farnsworth," Well, well. If it isn't our little munchkin moguls!
",53,44,3,12,Hermes,Hermes9610,Hermes," What's the trouble, men? Need some penny rolls for your profits?
",66,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Cubert9611,Cubert," Actually, thanks to Dwight's brilliant accounting and my unaccountable brilliance ...  ... our paper route now has over a million customers!
",142,44,3,12,Hermes,Dwight9612,Dwight," We're finally making more money than you guys! Aren't you impressed now, Pops? Aren'tcha? Aren'tcha?
",102,44,3,12,Cubert,Hermes9613,Hermes," Uh, in a small way, yes. But you still don't have your own building or conference table or ... or one of those things!
",120,44,3,12,Dwight,Zoidberg9614,Zoidberg," Hello!
",8,44,3,12,Hermes,Dwight9615,Dwight," Our dads are never impressed, no matter what we do.
",53,44,3,12,Zoidberg,Cubert9616,Cubert," Maybe we should start a fire.
",31,44,3,12,Dwight,Dwight9617,Dwight," If we really wanna impress them we'll have to crush them with strategy ... Dwight Lightning!
",94,44,3,12,Cubert,Cubert9618,Cubert," Very well. But I get to name the next strategy.
",49,44,3,12,Dwight,Announcer #19619,Announcer #1,"  This week on The Real World: The Sun.
",40,44,3,12,Cubert,Man #19620,Man #1,"  I'm burning to death!
",24,44,3,12,Announcer #1,Leela9621,Leela," You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun?
",64,44,3,12,Man #1,Hermes9622,Hermes," People, as you know, our young sons have become great successes in the very same field as us.
",95,44,3,12,Leela,Bender9623,Bender,"  Alright!
",11,44,3,12,Hermes,Fry9624,Fry,"  That's great!
",16,44,3,12,Bender,Leela9625,Leela,"  That's good!
",15,44,3,12,Fry,Hermes9626,Hermes," Naturally, we're humiliated.
",30,44,3,12,Leela,Farnsworth9627,Farnsworth," That's why we need you, our loyal crew, to make Planet Express 800% more profitable.
",86,44,3,12,Hermes,Hermes9628,Hermes," We'll start by slashing salaries, and this time I mean really slashing.
",73,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Leela9629,Leela," Uh, guys, I don't know how to tell you this, so I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly.
",95,44,3,12,Hermes,Fry9630,Fry," We don't work for you anymore!
",32,44,3,12,Leela,Farnsworth9631,Farnsworth," What?
",7,44,3,12,Fry,Leela9632,Leela," Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. We're paperboys now.
",64,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Cubert9633,Cubert," Incoming! We got papers to stuff, team! Hup two, hup two!
",59,44,3,12,Leela,Fry9634,Fry," Yes, sir.
",11,44,3,12,Cubert,Bender9635,Bender," Right away!
",13,44,3,12,Fry,Leela9636,Leela," We're on it, Mr. Farnsworth.
",30,44,3,12,Bender,Farnsworth9637,Farnsworth," Folks, the situation is grim but we shall prevail, thanks to you, our crack team of loyal dregs!
",98,44,3,12,Leela,Hermes9638,Hermes," I don't even know who this guy is!
",36,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Scruffy9639,Scruffy," I'm Scruffy, the janitor.
",27,44,3,12,Hermes,Farnsworth9640,Farnsworth," Yes, of course you are. Now we've got to buckle down and save Planet Express.
",79,44,3,12,Scruffy,Scruffy9641,Scruffy," I'm on break.
",15,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Cubert9642,Cubert," Sorry to interrupt this whirlwind of activity but we have an announcement.
",76,44,3,12,Scruffy,Dwight9643,Dwight," I direct your attention to these forms, which I'm presently engaged in handing to you.
",88,44,3,12,Cubert,Hermes9644,Hermes," Sweet guinea pig of Winnipeg! They've taken over our company!
",63,44,3,12,Dwight,Farnsworth9645,Farnsworth," Balderdash! I never agreed to that!
",37,44,3,12,Hermes,Dwight9646,Dwight," No. But you did declare yourself dead three years ago as a tax dodge.
",71,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth9647,Farnsworth," Tax dodge, nothing! You take one nap in a ditch at the park and they start declaring you this and that.
",105,44,3,12,Dwight,Cubert9648,Cubert," Either way, I technically inherit your building and your spaceship, which means Planet Express is now ...  ... Awesome Express!
",129,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Hermes9649,Hermes,"  You rotten kids!  Will you be hiring?
",40,44,3,12,Cubert,Dwight9650,Dwight," No.
",5,44,3,12,Hermes,Hermes9651,Hermes,"  You rotten kids!
",19,44,3,12,Dwight,Fry9652,Fry," There. One million papers, folded and loaded!
",47,44,3,12,Hermes,Cubert9653,Cubert," Hey, Leela, help me apply these flame decals I got in my cereal. They'll make the ship go faster.
",99,44,3,12,Fry,Leela9654,Leela," And what's your scientific basis for thinking that?
",53,44,3,12,Cubert,Cubert9655,Cubert," I'm 12.
",9,44,3,12,Leela,Farnsworth9656,Farnsworth," Oh, did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship?
",54,44,3,12,Cubert,Zoidberg9657,Zoidberg," There but for the grace of God.
",33,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Bender9658,Bender,"  Hush, little brewski,
Don't you leak,
Daddy wants to drink for at least a week.  Oh, my God! I think it's time!
",114,44,3,12,Zoidberg,Fry9659,Fry," Hurry, Leela! Get some coasters and cold mugs.
",48,44,3,12,Bender,Fry9660,Fry," Push, Bender, push!
",21,44,3,12,Fry,Leela9661,Leela," You're doing great!
",21,44,3,12,Fry,Bender9662,Bender," It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed outta me.
",56,44,3,12,Leela,Fry9663,Fry," Almost there. Just two more bottles.
",38,44,3,12,Bender,Bender9664,Bender," Is it OK? I can't hear anything.
",34,44,3,12,Fry,Fry9665,Fry," It's an ale! Five gallons, six ounces!
",40,44,3,12,Bender,Dwight9666,Dwight," Hey, what's goin' on? This is a delivery company not a delivery room!
",71,44,3,12,Fry,Cubert9667,Cubert," We just busted our bums delivering a million papers and this is how you greet us, with a bunch of frosty, cold beers?
",119,44,3,12,Dwight,Fry9668,Fry," Hey, wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?
",71,44,3,12,Cubert,Cubert9669,Cubert," Uh ... we just did, OK? 'Cause we're awesome! Yeah! Awesome.
",62,44,3,12,Fry,Dwight9670,Dwight," Yeah, awesome!
",16,44,3,12,Cubert,Leela9671,Leela," Hello, Awesome Express; the rude, crude delivery dudes. How may I direct your call? What's that? You haven't gotten your paper? In how long?
",142,44,3,12,Dwight,Farnsworth9672,Farnsworth," Uh, might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon? And another tequila slammer?  Please?
",104,44,3,12,Leela,Labarbara9673,Labarbara," Don't you sweet talk me, you wrinkly, old tube sack!
",54,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Hermes9674,Hermes," Might I have one too, wife?
",29,44,3,12,Labarbara,Labarbara9675,Labarbara," Oh, you're both pathetic, being jealous of your own offspring. Now you should be happy they became successes, instead of following in your foot stamps.
",153,44,3,12,Hermes,Hermes9676,Hermes," Oh, it's true. But they grow up so fast. We just wanted a few more years of being better than them.
",101,44,3,12,Labarbara,Farnsworth9677,Farnsworth," They're so stinking talented, they don't even need their fathers anymore.
",75,44,3,12,Hermes,Cubert9678,Cubert," Dad! We screwed up!
",21,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth9679,Farnsworth," You did? Tough luck, suckers!
",31,44,3,12,Cubert,Dwight9680,Dwight," Please, help us, Pops. We agreed to deliver way more papers than we can handle.
",81,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Cubert9681,Cubert,"  But we couldn't handle them, so we started dumping the extras in a crater on the Moon.
",89,44,3,12,Dwight,Dwight9682,Dwight,"  And now everyone's yelling at us about our missing papers!
",61,44,3,12,Cubert,Cubert9683,Cubert,"  And we don't know what to do!
",32,44,3,12,Dwight,Farnsworth9684,Farnsworth," Why did you boys do all this?
",31,44,3,12,Cubert,Dwight9685,Dwight,"  We just wanted you to be proud of us.
",40,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Hermes9686,Hermes," Proud of you? You ruined us with sleazy business practices and a complete disregard for human decency. Of course we're proud of you!
",134,44,3,12,Dwight,Farnsworth9687,Farnsworth," Damn right we are! Now come on, let's go do a little father-son weaselling out of this.
",89,44,3,12,Hermes,Farnsworth9688,Farnsworth,"  Good thing I had this net installed for catching giraffes.
",61,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Hermes9689,Hermes," OK, boys, let me show you how a paper man does it.
",52,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Little Prince9690,Little Prince," Au revoir!
",12,44,3,12,Hermes,Dwight9691,Dwight," Can I use the gun, Dad?
",25,44,3,12,Little Prince,Hermes9692,Hermes," Aw, what kind of father would I be if I said no?
",50,44,3,12,Dwight,Dwight9693,Dwight," Only one house to go. We did it!  Run away! That bully, Bret Blob, lives there!
",81,44,3,12,Hermes,Cubert9694,Cubert," He's ugly mean stupid stink mucus! And last week we sort of ... broke his window.
",83,44,3,12,Dwight,Hermes9695,Hermes," Alright, alright. What do we do when we break somebody's window?
",66,44,3,12,Cubert,Dwight9696,Dwight,"  Pay for it?
",14,44,3,12,Hermes,Hermes9697,Hermes," Oh, heavens, no! We apologise, with nice, cheap words!
",56,44,3,12,Dwight,Brett9698,Brett," I thought I heard the doorbell but I see it was the dorkbell!
",63,44,3,12,Hermes,Dwight9699,Dwight," Man, you're funny. Good one, Bret.
",36,44,3,12,Brett,Farnsworth9700,Farnsworth," Now, now, no need to give us the business. We'd like a word with you daddy.
",77,44,3,12,Dwight,Brett9701,Brett," Whatever.  Dad!
",17,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Hermes9702,Hermes," Don't worry, boys. I'm sure his father is a perfectly normal, reasonable man.
",79,44,3,12,Brett,H.G. Blob9703,H.G. Blob," What the hell do you want?
",28,44,3,12,Hermes,Farnsworth9704,Farnsworth," Mr. Blob, our sons have come to apologise for damaging your window. They've learned their lesson and they want to make amends.
",128,44,3,12,H.G. Blob,Cubert9705,Cubert," Sorry, sir.
",13,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Dwight9706,Dwight," Yeah, sorry.
",14,44,3,12,Cubert,H.G. Blob9707,H.G. Blob," You can shove your apology into the bottom of your one-way digestive system.
",78,44,3,12,Dwight,Farnsworth9708,Farnsworth," Now see here. We assured our sons that you'd accept their apology.
",68,44,3,12,H.G. Blob,H.G. Blob9709,H.G. Blob," Aww. Tell you what, I'll accept their apology when they kiss my ass! Which I don't have!
",90,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth9710,Farnsworth," No one gives my boy that option!
",34,44,3,12,H.G. Blob,Hermes9711,Hermes," Bring it on, Jello-pop!
",25,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Cubert9712,Cubert," Yeah, get him, Dad!
",21,44,3,12,Hermes,Dwight9713,Dwight," Show 'em who's boss!  Get 'em ... Pops!
",41,44,3,12,Cubert,Cubert9714,Cubert," Right.
",8,44,3,12,Dwight,Cubert9715,Cubert," That was incredible! You are the bravest dads in the entire trauma centre!
",76,44,3,12,Cubert,Dwight9716,Dwight," You guys almost had him ... until he digested you.
",52,44,3,12,Cubert,Hermes9717,Hermes," Oh, you're good kids.  If I could feel anything right now, it would be pride.  I was wrong! I can still feel pain!
",116,44,3,12,Dwight,Farnsworth9718,Farnsworth," He's come to finish the job! Someone toss me out the window!
",62,44,3,12,Hermes,H.G. Blob9719,H.G. Blob," No, no, wait. I-I feel terrible about what happened. I-I've just been under a lot of stress lately down at the plant, y'know. They're-They're bringing in computers to ""improve productivity"" and, well, that's no excuse for how I acted. But the boy needs to see that real men solve their disagreements with words, not violence, so, uh, if you'll accept my apology, well, I hope we can put this embarrassing incident behind us.
",426,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth9720,Farnsworth," I suppose.
",12,44,3,12,H.G. Blob,Bender9721,Bender," Hey, chumps, I heard you were on the ass-end of an ass-kicking so I figured you could use a couple these little babies.
",121,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Hermes9722,Hermes," Oh, why not? Might as well live it up as long as I've got this catheter in me!
",80,44,3,12,Bender,Farnsworth9723,Farnsworth," Won't you join us, Mr. Blob?
",30,44,3,12,Hermes,H.G. Blob9724,H.G. Blob," Sounds like a plan!
",21,44,3,12,Farnsworth,Hermes9725,Hermes," This is what makes life worth clinging to; three fathers enjoying a day out with their sons.
",94,44,3,12,H.G. Blob,Farnsworth9726,Farnsworth," It would seem we've taught our boys a lesson about life: Man or Blob, it's what's inside that counts.
",103,44,3,12,Hermes,Bender9727,Bender,"  Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh
Well, Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride,
Blah, blah, blah, something, Bender is great!
Froggy went a-courtin' and Bender is great, uh-huh--
",202,45,3,13,Farnsworth,Fry9728,Fry," Oh, my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time!  There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there.
",120,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9729,Bender," What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?
",67,45,3,13,Fry,Fry9730,Fry," No, it's an old Volkswagen van.   Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old van?
",77,45,3,13,Bender,Sal9731,Sal,"  Sure. You wanna dump the corpses out of theres, it's yourses.
",64,45,3,13,Fry,Fry9732,Fry," Yeah, yeah, I've gotten used cars before.
",43,45,3,13,Sal,Leela9733,Leela," What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?
",73,45,3,13,Fry,Fry9734,Fry," It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite you to come a-knockin'!
",103,45,3,13,Leela,Amy9735,Amy," Wow, neat.
",12,45,3,13,Fry,Hermes9736,Hermes," It's a triumph of free-spirited German engineering.
",53,45,3,13,Amy,Amy9737,Amy," Hey, the speedometer only goes up to 80. This thing can't go faster than 80,000 miles an hour?
",96,45,3,13,Hermes,Fry9738,Fry," No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player with genuine mono sound.
",97,45,3,13,Amy,Farnsworth9739,Farnsworth," Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?
",69,45,3,13,Fry,Fry9740,Fry," Under the seat.
",17,45,3,13,Farnsworth,Leela9741,Leela," Why won't it start?
",21,45,3,13,Fry,Fry9742,Fry," It just needs some gas.
",25,45,3,13,Leela,Farnsworth9743,Farnsworth," Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038.
",74,45,3,13,Fry,Leela9744,Leela," Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels.
",74,45,3,13,Farnsworth,Fry9745,Fry," Like what?
",12,45,3,13,Leela,Leela9746,Leela," Whale oil.  Bender, lift it up to the can opener.
",51,45,3,13,Fry,Bender9747,Bender," Oh, no! I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off.
",88,45,3,13,Leela,Fry9748,Fry," Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs.
",91,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9749,Bender," What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.
",88,45,3,13,Fry,Fry9750,Fry," Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing that can opener could ever do would be worse than that.
",139,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9751,Bender," OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans.
",60,45,3,13,Fry,Leela9752,Leela," Come on!
",10,45,3,13,Bender,Hermes9753,Hermes," You can do it!
",16,45,3,13,Leela,Amy9754,Amy," Bender!
",9,45,3,13,Hermes,Farnsworth9755,Farnsworth," Go on, you dummy.
",19,45,3,13,Amy,Bender9756,Bender,"  Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,
Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,
",76,45,3,13,Farnsworth,Fry9757,Fry," Oh, no!
",9,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9758,Bender,"  Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,
Cause the master's gone away.
",69,45,3,13,Fry,Zoidberg9759,Zoidberg,"  It's toe-tapping-ly tragic.
",30,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9760,Bender," Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?
",59,45,3,13,Zoidberg,Doctor9761,Doctor," This is the worst part of the job.
",36,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9762,Bender," What is it, good news?
",24,45,3,13,Doctor,Doctor9763,Doctor," Bender, your hydraulics are shot. You'll never move again.
",60,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9764,Bender," You mean--
",12,45,3,13,Doctor,Doctor9765,Doctor," I'm sorry, you'll have to get a new one.
",42,45,3,13,Bender,Fry9766,Fry," Oh, no! This is terrible.
",27,45,3,13,Doctor,Zoidberg9767,Zoidberg," Poor Bender.
",14,45,3,13,Fry,Farnsworth9768,Farnsworth," Well, let's drag him to the kerb.
",35,45,3,13,Zoidberg,Fry9769,Fry," Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes.
",101,45,3,13,Farnsworth,Bender9770,Bender,"  Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again.
",56,45,3,13,Fry,Robot #19771,Robot #1," Ho, ho! Hello there!
",22,45,3,13,Bender,Leela9772,Leela," Look, Bender! It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter.
",75,45,3,13,Robot #1,Patch Cord Adams9773,Patch Cord Adams," Come on, take it. What's the matter, can't move your arms?
",60,45,3,13,Leela,Bender9774,Bender," Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now.
",52,45,3,13,Patch Cord Adams,Patch Cord Adams9775,Patch Cord Adams," Hey, here's a giggle!  Did you hear why they're using Windows 3000 as a prison guard?
",87,45,3,13,Bender,Fry9776,Fry," No, why?
",10,45,3,13,Patch Cord Adams,Patch Cord Adams9777,Patch Cord Adams," 'Cause it always locks up.
",28,45,3,13,Fry,Bender9778,Bender," For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!
",45,45,3,13,Patch Cord Adams,Patch Cord Adams9779,Patch Cord Adams," Well, so long. Get well soon.  Oh, well, so long anyway.
",58,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9780,Bender," Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way.
",75,45,3,13,Patch Cord Adams,Fry9781,Fry," Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?
",68,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9782,Bender," Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people's suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up.  Wow, that was great.
",114,45,3,13,Fry,Beck9783,Beck," Hey, thanks. You a fan?
",25,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9784,Bender," I dunno. Let me see.  Oh, my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me.
",138,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9785,Beck," Don't take it so hard. I used to miss my body too but then I fished this mannequin out of the 92c Store dumpster.
",115,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9786,Bender," Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you.
",151,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9787,Beck," So do it, robot. It's easier than it looks.
",45,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9788,Bender," Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now.
",62,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9789,Beck," Or maybe you'll be the best musician ever.
",44,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9790,Bender," What's this for?
",18,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9791,Beck," Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast.  Come on, move those arms. Use the power of mental thinking. Make it dynamic.  Yeah-ee! Alright, congratulations, my friend.
",191,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9792,Bender," Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?
",41,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9793,Beck," Exactly. I use those all the time in my music. Bender, I want you to become my new washboard player.
",102,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9794,Bender," Alright!  Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
",44,45,3,13,Beck,Bender9795,Bender," Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm off to rock a series of mid-level venues.
",82,45,3,13,Bender,Hermes9796,Hermes," Kudos, Bender. You got mangled and now you're a singer. Both our dreams came true.
",84,45,3,13,Bender,Fry9797,Fry," Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on tour and live there, in the van?
",104,45,3,13,Hermes,Zoidberg9798,Zoidberg," Oh, I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too poor to follow a band around in a van.
",79,45,3,13,Fry,Beck9799,Beck,"  Come on, move it! We gotta get to the concert and make the audience wait for it at the start.
",96,45,3,13,Zoidberg,Zoidberg9800,Zoidberg," Bad news, friends. My shell ran.
",34,45,3,13,Beck,Amy9801,Amy," Zoidberg, you idiot, my outfit. It's, it's--
",46,45,3,13,Zoidberg,Leela9802,Leela," Kinda cool.
",13,45,3,13,Amy,Fry9803,Fry," Yeah, I like it.
",18,45,3,13,Leela,Amy9804,Amy," Me too, now that I'm used to it.
",34,45,3,13,Fry,Zoidberg9805,Zoidberg," Then it was all on purpose! You're lucky to have Zoidberg as a friend. But cross me, and I'll turn on you like that!
",118,45,3,13,Amy,Beck9806,Beck,"  There's a destination a little up the road,
From the habitations and the towns we know,
A place we saw the lights turn low,
The jigsaw jazz and the get-fresh glow,
Pullin' out jives and jamboree handouts,
Two turntables and a microphone,
Bottles and cans just clap your hands,
Just clap your hands.
",301,45,3,13,Zoidberg,All9807,All,"  Where it's at!
",17,45,3,13,Beck,Bender9808,Bender,"  Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.
",44,45,3,13,All,Beck9809,Beck," That was a washboard break.
",29,45,3,13,Bender,Fry9810,Fry," Oh, yeah!
",11,45,3,13,Beck,Amy9811,Amy," Yeah!  One bowl of Jell-O knuckles, please.
",45,45,3,13,Fry,Barman9812,Barman," That'll be three pick-e-tures of George Washington.
",53,45,3,13,Amy,Amy9813,Amy," Oh, no! My beautiful money.
",29,45,3,13,Barman,Leela9814,Leela," It got ruined in the wash.
",28,45,3,13,Amy,Fry9815,Fry," Mine too, even my change.
",27,45,3,13,Leela,Barman9816,Barman," Get lost, you money-less hippies!
",35,45,3,13,Fry,Horrible Gelatinous Hick9817,Horrible Gelatinous Hick," You heard him, freaks. We don't like your type around here. These are the types we like.
",90,45,3,13,Barman,Beck9818,Beck," Bender, that was the best 40-minute washboard solo I've ever heard. And the parts when I was awake blew my mind.
",114,45,3,13,Horrible Gelatinous Hick,Bender9819,Bender," Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!
",57,45,3,13,Beck,Robot #1 #19820,Robot #1 #1," I don't believe my broken eyes! It's Bender, the washboard player! Hey, man, we caught your concert from here.
",112,45,3,13,Bender,Robot #1 #29821,Robot #1 #2," You rock!
",11,45,3,13,Robot #1 #1,Fembot #19822,Fembot #1," Oh, oh, Bender! Sign my chest! It's in that bin behind me.
",60,45,3,13,Robot #1 #2,Robot #1 #39823,Robot #1 #3," Yo, brother, thanks for showing that broken robots are still useful.
",70,45,3,13,Fembot #1,Bender9824,Bender," Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be--  That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass.
",172,45,3,13,Robot #1 #3,Beck9825,Beck," Whoa, dog. Just cold chill.  You know, when I'm upset, I write a song about it. Like when I wrote Devil's Haircut, I was feeling really-- What's that song about?
",163,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9826,Bender," Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phoney ones like ""odelay"".
",82,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9827,Beck," ""Odelay"" is a word. Just look it up in the Becktionary.
",57,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9828,Bender," Ooh!
",6,45,3,13,Beck,Bender9829,Bender," I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary.  No, no, the rhyming Becktionary.
",84,45,3,13,Bender,Beck9830,Beck," I wish I could help raise awareness about broken robots. But what can I do? I only weigh eight pounds.
",104,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9831,Bender," Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look like they care about things!
",104,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9832,Beck," We can all get together for a big benefit concert in San Francisco!
",69,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9833,Bender," And we could call it ""Bend-Aid"", after me, Bender!
",52,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9834,Beck," And you can sing that song you're writing!
",44,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9835,Bender," And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me: Bender.
",73,45,3,13,Beck,Bender9836,Bender," Alright. ""Hands in the air"" rhymes with ""Just don't care"" and ... finished!  Eck! Smells like something died in the wall!
",123,45,3,13,Bender,Fry9837,Fry," Surprise!
",11,45,3,13,Bender,Leela9838,Leela," Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake.
",77,45,3,13,Fry,Bender9839,Bender," Alright, but hands off the minibar.
",37,45,3,13,Leela,Fry9840,Fry," Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much better life is without it. Well, let's see what's on.
",125,45,3,13,Bender,Announcer #1 #19841,Announcer #1 #1,"  Tuesday, Golden Gate Park, the monsters of vaguely-folkish alterna-rock will strum your brains out at Bend-Aid! Featuring Beck, Wailing Fungus and special guest, Bender!
",172,45,3,13,Fry,Announcer #1 #29842,Announcer #1 #2,"  A portion of the proceeds might go to help broken robots.
",60,45,3,13,Announcer #1 #1,Fry9843,Fry," Yeah!
",7,45,3,13,Announcer #1 #2,Zoidberg9844,Zoidberg," Hooray, robot!
",16,45,3,13,Fry,Amy9845,Amy," Bender, you're famous!
",24,45,3,13,Zoidberg,Bender9846,Bender," Yeah.
",7,45,3,13,Amy,Leela9847,Leela," This coming-together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?
",83,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9848,Bender,"  Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now: I've got fame, money, groupies, and it's all thanks to being completely immobilised.  That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage tomorrow and say, ""Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!"".
",379,45,3,13,Leela,Fry9849,Fry," Bender, you can move! You're cured!
",37,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9850,Bender," Oh, crap! It's a miracle!
",27,45,3,13,Fry,Bender9851,Bender," I can move again.  My music career is over.
",45,45,3,13,Bender,Fry9852,Fry," Bender, I don't claim to understand ""the biz"" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?
",103,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9853,Bender,"  No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish.  Wait, that's it! I'll fake it!
",211,45,3,13,Fry,Amy9854,Amy," You'd better not do that at the concert.
",42,45,3,13,Bender,Zoidberg9855,Zoidberg," I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, I get stuff in my throat.
",67,45,3,13,Amy,Amy9856,Amy," You are so disgusting, I--
",28,45,3,13,Zoidberg,Leela9857,Leela," They're beautiful.
",20,45,3,13,Amy,Zoidberg9858,Zoidberg," Ew, you're touching them!
",27,45,3,13,Leela,Amy9859,Amy," I've never seen pearls like this. Dr. Zoidberg, you're amazing.
",65,45,3,13,Zoidberg,Zoidberg9860,Zoidberg," I am? At last! Recognition!
",29,45,3,13,Amy,Emcee9861,Emcee,"  Gentle hippies, put your filthy hands together for the folk stylings of Cylon and Garfunkel!
",95,45,3,13,Zoidberg,Garfunkel9862,Garfunkel," Here's a song that was beautiful when performed by my ancestor, Art.
 Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
",106,45,3,13,Emcee,Cylon9863,Cylon," and   Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.
",42,45,3,13,Garfunkel,Garfunkel9864,Garfunkel,"  Remember me to one who loves there.
",38,45,3,13,Cylon,Cylon9865,Cylon," and   She once was a true love of mine.
",41,45,3,13,Garfunkel,Leela9866,Leela," We're home.
",13,45,3,13,Cylon,Amy9867,Amy," Well, let's earn some bread.
",30,45,3,13,Leela,Fry9868,Fry," Brothers and sisters, get your love beads. Can't journey to the centre of your mind without love beads!
",105,45,3,13,Amy,Hippie #19869,Hippie #1," Wow, look at the colours. These'll go great with my soul.
",59,45,3,13,Fry,Zoidberg9870,Zoidberg," Glad you like them. I've been making fine jewellery for years, apparently.
",76,45,3,13,Hippie #1,Hippie #29871,Hippie #2," I'll take three.
",18,45,3,13,Zoidberg,Hippie #39872,Hippie #3," Give me one, man!
",19,45,3,13,Hippie #2,Hippie #49873,Hippie #4," I'll trade you a bad poem!
",28,45,3,13,Hippie #3,Emcee9874,Emcee,"  And now, stand up and turn on your hidden tape recorders for ... Beck! With special guest, Bender, the broken robot.
",119,45,3,13,Hippie #4,Fry9875,Fry,"  Bender rules!
",16,45,3,13,Emcee,Hippie #59876,Hippie #5," Groove on, man!
",17,45,3,13,Fry,Leela9877,Leela," Rock it, Bender!
",18,45,3,13,Hippie #5,Zoidberg9878,Zoidberg," Play that thing!
",18,45,3,13,Leela,Beck9879,Beck,"  Can't you hear those cavalry drums,
Hijacking your equilibrium...
",68,45,3,13,Zoidberg,Bender9880,Bender," Whoa-oh, yeah!
",16,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9881,Beck,"  ...Midnight hags in the mausoleum,
",37,45,3,13,Bender,Beck9882,Beck," Thank you. That song doesn't usually last three hours, but we got into a serious thing ... and then I forgot how it ended. Anyway, one last item of business before we go.
",172,45,3,13,Beck,Garfunkel9883,Garfunkel," Bender, to start your foundation for broken robots, here's a big, cardboard cheque for $14,000.
",97,45,3,13,Beck,Cylon9884,Cylon," It's been an emotional day for me.
",36,45,3,13,Garfunkel,Bender9885,Bender,"  I don't know what to say.
",28,45,3,13,Cylon,Beck9886,Beck," Then maybe you should sing it. Lay it down, boys.
",51,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9887,Bender," Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery ...  ... this is a song called My Broken Friend.
 People say my broken friend is useless,
But I say his mind is free,
There's lots of things my mangled robot friend could be,
",222,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9888,Beck," Kick it!
",10,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9889,Bender,"  He could make a good...
",26,45,3,13,Beck,Bender9890,Bender," and   ...hat-rack
",19,45,3,13,Bender,Beck9891,Beck,"  He only has to stand there,
",30,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9892,Bender,"  Or a cheap...
",16,45,3,13,Beck,Bender9893,Bender," and   ...doorstop,
",20,45,3,13,Bender,Beck9894,Beck,"  He doesn't need to move
",26,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9895,Bender,"  Or a great big...
",20,45,3,13,Beck,Bender9896,Bender," and   ...giant Thermos,
",25,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9897,Bender,"  With a twist-off top,
",24,45,3,13,Bender,Beck9898,Beck,"  That would be good for soup,
",31,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9899,Bender,"  He could be a storage closet...
",34,45,3,13,Beck,Bender9900,Bender," and   ...for outdated pants,
",30,45,3,13,Bender,Beck9901,Beck," I like 'em tight!
",19,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9902,Bender,"  My broken friend could do it all,
",36,45,3,13,Beck,Bender9903,Bender," and   Just give him a chance!
",31,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9904,Bender,"  That robot has a tragic secret,
That I'd like to share...
",60,45,3,13,Bender,Beck9905,Beck," For real?
",11,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9906,Bender,"  ...My broken friend is closer to me,
Than an ass to a chair...
",65,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9907,Beck," Hm.
",5,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9908,Bender,"  ...That robot's name I never told you...
",43,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9909,Beck," Who's that?
",13,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9910,Bender,"  ...You could not foresee...
",30,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9911,Beck," C'mon, give it up.
",20,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9912,Bender,"  ...I'll say it loud and sing it proud...
",43,45,3,13,Beck,Bender9913,Bender," and   His name is you and me.
",31,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9914,Bender,"  Don't melt me down into a crowbar,
",37,45,3,13,Bender,Beck9915,Beck,"  It suffers alone,
",20,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9916,Bender,"  Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs,
",45,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9917,Beck," Hey.
",6,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9918,Bender,"  Or toss me into a trash can...
",33,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9919,Beck," Bender, what are you doing?
",29,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9920,Bender,"  ...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs...
",50,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9921,Beck," What are you doing?
",21,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9922,Bender,"  ...Don't crush me into an anchor...
",38,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9923,Beck," Yo! What's the dealy-o?
",25,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9924,Bender,"  ...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing...
",52,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9925,Beck," Hold it! What? No!
",20,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9926,Bender,"  ...I'm telling you, my broken friend...
",42,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9927,Beck," B-Bender.
",11,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9928,Bender,"  ...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!
",57,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9929,Beck," No!
",5,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9930,Bender,"  I'm telling you, my broken friend...
",39,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9931,Beck," Cut it!
",9,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9932,Bender,"  ...Can do 'most anything!
",28,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9933,Beck," Cut it!
",9,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9934,Bender," Yeah!
",7,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9935,Beck," Cut it!
",9,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9936,Bender," Curse my natural showmanship!
",31,45,3,13,Beck,Robot #1 #49937,Robot #1 #4,"  You big, fat fraud! You're not really broken!
",48,45,3,13,Bender,Robot #1 #59938,Robot #1 #5,"  But you will be in a minute! Bum-rush the stage!
",51,45,3,13,Robot #1 #4,Robot #1 #69939,Robot #1 #6," Get him!
",10,45,3,13,Robot #1 #5,Hippie #69940,Hippie #6," Oh, harsh! I didn't get my beads.
",35,45,3,13,Robot #1 #6,Beck9941,Beck," You, minion, lift up my arm.  After him!
",42,45,3,13,Hippie #6,Bender9942,Bender," Well, everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers.
",70,45,3,13,Beck,Caterpillar Alien9943,Caterpillar Alien," What is this? The Year of the Jerk?
",37,45,3,13,Bender,Fry9944,Fry," Hurry! The Golden Gate Bridge! Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal.
",79,45,3,13,Caterpillar Alien,Bender9945,Bender," Oh, no! I forgot this is a hoverbridge.
",41,45,3,13,Fry,Leela9946,Leela," And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.
",37,45,3,13,Bender,Fry9947,Fry," Is any of that a problem?
",27,45,3,13,Leela,Zoidberg9948,Zoidberg," Not if you've lived a life without regret.
",44,45,3,13,Fry,Bender9949,Bender," I'll save me!
",15,45,3,13,Zoidberg,Leela9950,Leela," Quick, grab his footcups.
",27,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9951,Bender," Hey? What? No.
",16,45,3,13,Leela,Fry9952,Fry," Phew!
",7,45,3,13,Bender,Leela9953,Leela," Bummer.
",9,45,3,13,Fry,Bender9954,Bender,"  Someone fat get in my way!   I'm broken again. I can't move any part of me.
",78,45,3,13,Leela,Beck9955,Beck," Good.
",7,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9956,Bender," I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with you. I never meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone.
",124,45,3,13,Beck,Beck9957,Beck," Bender, that's some played-out, new-jack, horse crap-- But I know you don't mean it so apology accepted.
",106,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9958,Bender," So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?
",33,45,3,13,Beck,Garfunkel9959,Garfunkel," Over my dead career!
",22,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9960,Bender," Well, it was worth a shot.
",28,45,3,13,Garfunkel,Fry9961,Fry,"  C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home.
",67,45,3,13,Bender,Bender9962,Bender," Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up.
Fry cracked corn,
And I don't care,
Leela cracked corn,
I still don't care,
Bender cracked corn,
And he is great!
Take that, you stupid corn!
",206,45,3,13,Fry,Hermes9963,Hermes," Go get it, boy!
",17,46,3,14,Bender,Fry9964,Fry," So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're kinda dangerous but I finally mastered them.
",119,46,3,14,Hermes,Leela9965,Leela," Those aren't swan boats, they're swans.
",41,46,3,14,Fry,Fry9966,Fry," Oh. That explains these boat eggs.
",36,46,3,14,Leela,Farnsworth9967,Farnsworth," Wha?
",6,46,3,14,Fry,Tate9968,Tate," Pitiful ballplayers of Earth, I am Ethan ""Bubblegum"" Tate, commander of the Harlem Globetrotters.  For generations, your puny planet has lived in peace with the Globetrotter Homeworld. But now, for no reason, we challenge you to defend your honour on the basketball court.  Will no one meet our challenge? Have none of you pathetic Earthlings game?
",350,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Fry9969,Fry,"  What happens if we lose?
",27,46,3,14,Tate,Tate9970,Tate," Nothing. There's nothing at stake and no threat, beyond the shame of defeat!
",78,46,3,14,Fry,Farnsworth9971,Farnsworth," This will not stand!  I'll take you on, you air-balling bozos.
",64,46,3,14,Tate,Tate9972,Tate," You, old man? Sweet Clyde, laugh derisively at him.
",53,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth9973,Farnsworth," I may be an old man. In fact, I'm fairly sure I am. But I'll put you Globetrotters in your place with my team of mutant atomic supermen!
",138,46,3,14,Tate,Hermes9974,Hermes," Hooray, Professor!
",20,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth9975,Farnsworth," Behold: My mutant atomic supermen.
",36,46,3,14,Hermes,Leela9976,Leela," They're only a foot high, Professor.
",38,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth9977,Farnsworth," Well, they're still young. Mere atomic super boys, really. We'll need to speed up their growth with time particles called Chronitons.
",135,46,3,14,Leela,Bender9978,Bender," Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisa--
",64,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth9979,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! You're off to the Tempus Nebula to gather Chronitons.
",76,46,3,14,Bender,Fry9980,Fry," Hey, Leela, look at me!
",25,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Leela9981,Leela," Your face can take a lot of punishment. That's good to know.
",62,46,3,14,Fry,Fry9982,Fry," There's a lot about my face you don't know! Perhaps you and it could get better acquainted over dinner.
",105,46,3,14,Leela,Leela9983,Leela," Alright! Cool your jets, hotshot.
",35,46,3,14,Fry,Fry9984,Fry," C'mon, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there.
",83,46,3,14,Leela,Leela9985,Leela," No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face.
",59,46,3,14,Fry,Bender9986,Bender,"  Ow! Oh, my God! Ow!
",22,46,3,14,Leela,Leela9987,Leela," Here you go. Hot off the nebula.
",34,46,3,14,Bender,Farnsworth9988,Farnsworth," None too soon. While you were gone the Trotters held a news conference to announce that I was a jive sucker.  Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants.
",150,46,3,14,Leela,Amy9989,Amy," Hi!
",5,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Arachneon9990,Arachneon,"  Hello!
",9,46,3,14,Amy,Albert9991,Albert," Marv Albert here at Madison Cube Garden where the Harlem Globetrotters take on a squad of atomic supermen in what promises to be a by-the-numbers athletic contest with no surprises whatsoever.  Here's the tip-off. Globetrotter ball. Sweet Clyde Dixon to Bubblegum Tate. Drives down-court-- And Curly Joe from the rear.
",320,46,3,14,Arachneon,Zoidberg9992,Zoidberg," That one grabbed his behindus!
",32,46,3,14,Albert,Leela9993,Leela," Sh!
",5,46,3,14,Zoidberg,Hermes9994,Hermes," Quiet!
",8,46,3,14,Leela,Tate9995,Tate," Who dares laugh at the Jesters of Dunk? We came to terrify and humiliate you, not tickle your funnybones. Watch as I embarrass your civilisation by passing the ball to Curly Joe.  Only to have it remain in my hands with elastic.  And perhaps this will wipe the smiles from your faces.
",286,46,3,14,Hermes,Albert9996,Albert," Goosh goes up.  Rejected! Grotrian from half-court.  Yes!
",59,46,3,14,Tate,Albert9997,Albert," Supermen lead 45-42. Arachneon with the steal, to Thorias. Thorias from downtown!  Yes! He's really showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest can do!
",158,46,3,14,Albert,Farnsworth9998,Farnsworth," No showboarding, you atomic hotdog!
",37,46,3,14,Albert,Albert9999,Albert," And that's the half, with the Supermen up 48-42. Surprisingly dull, so far.  Bubblegum, the Trotters are down by six. Reactions?
",130,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Tate10000,Tate," It was always our plan to trail at the half, thus deepening Earth's eventual humiliation. Also, what game were the refs watching?
",131,46,3,14,Albert,Albert10001,Albert," Curly Joe, easily amused by his own antics ...  ... continues to wreak havoc on--
",83,46,3,14,Tate,Farnsworth10002,Farnsworth," What the--  Did everything just jump around, or did my brain just stroke off there for a second?
",98,46,3,14,Albert,Albert10003,Albert," Ladies and gentlemen, something very strange has just happened in this basketball game between space clowns and atomic monsters.
",130,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10004,Farnsworth," Time-out! Time-out!
",21,46,3,14,Albert,Fry10005,Fry," What's happening?
",19,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10006,Farnsworth," We seem to be lurching forward randomly in time, like a needle skipping on a record player.
",93,46,3,14,Fry,Amy10007,Amy," What's causing it? Is it my outfit?
",37,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10008,Farnsworth," No. It must have something to do with those time particles I used to grow the Supermen. Time and space are ripping apart at the seams.
",136,46,3,14,Amy,Thorias10009,Thorias," Oops!
",7,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10010,Farnsworth," Oh, great! Now, on top of everything, we need a new fifth man.
",64,46,3,14,Thorias,Fry10011,Fry," Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Put me in, Professor. I wanna show Leela my skills.
",68,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10012,Farnsworth," Hmm. Will said skills pay the bills?
",38,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10013,Fry," Who cares? We're 35 points ahead with two minutes left. What could possibly--
",79,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Albert10014,Albert," Globetrotters win, 244-86. A dark day for humanity, folks. We have been beaten ... in basketball.
",99,46,3,14,Fry,Curly Joe10015,Curly Joe," Yeah, that's how we do it!
",28,46,3,14,Albert,Sweet Clyde10016,Sweet Clyde," How's that?
",13,46,3,14,Curly Joe,Tate10017,Tate," You are all fools of the highest calibre.
",43,46,3,14,Sweet Clyde,Leela10018,Leela," I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again you screwed up. Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
",131,46,3,14,Tate,Hermes10019,Hermes," I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.
",62,46,3,14,Leela,Farnsworth10020,Farnsworth," Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes. We have bigger problems. This time disruption is extremely serious.
",115,46,3,14,Hermes,Tate10021,Tate," Damn right, brother man. This chronological wang-dang-doodle could destroy the very matrix of reality.
",104,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10022,Farnsworth," Tate? What do you know about this?
",36,46,3,14,Tate,Tate10023,Tate," Not much, yet. But I am senior lecturer of physics at Globetrotter U. And I'd like to help you investigate.
",109,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10024,Farnsworth," You're that Bubblegum Tate?
",29,46,3,14,Tate,Tate10025,Tate," Well I sure ain't his grandma. Now look here, Prof.  I think we got ourselves an excess of Chronitons in the subatomic interstices.
",133,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10026,Farnsworth," Yes, I see. Something involving that many big words could easily destabilise time itself.
",91,46,3,14,Tate,Fry10027,Fry," Is that a problem?
",20,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10028,Farnsworth," Indeed so. At this rate, by Tuesday it will be Thursday; by Wednesday, it will be August; and by Thursday, it will be the end of existence as we know it.
",155,46,3,14,Fry,Man #110029,Man #1," I'll have to ask you to clear out now. The circus need to set up for tomorrow's big--
",87,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Linda10030,Linda,"  Time continues to skip forward randomly. Details at 11.

",35,46,3,14,Linda,Linda10034,Linda,"  --found dead in her bathtub.
",31,46,3,14,Linda,Farnsworth10035,Farnsworth," Interesting. It's as if we behave normally during the time skips, but then we have no memory of it.
",101,46,3,14,Linda,Fry10036,Fry," You mean we just--
",20,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10037,Farnsworth," My, yes. Ooh, just like that. Any luck, Bubblegum?
",52,46,3,14,Fry,Tate10038,Tate," Not yet. Listen, I hope you don't mind if I dribble a little while I work.
",76,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10039,Farnsworth," Not if you'll grant me the same liberty.
",42,46,3,14,Tate,Bender10040,Bender," Ooh! Ooh! Bubblegum? My name's Bender and I'm a huge fan of your work, both on and off the court. Can I be a Globetrotter?
",124,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Tate10041,Tate," Shut up, turkey.
",18,46,3,14,Bender,Farnsworth10042,Farnsworth," Bubblegum, look at this. The background time radiation is fluctuating wildly.
",79,46,3,14,Tate,Tate10043,Tate," Good Lord! That sucker's shaking around like some fine, imported booty.
",73,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Hermes10044,Hermes," Say, I'm no physicist, but I think I know how to stop the skipping. We'll just--
",82,46,3,14,Tate,Hermes10045,Hermes," I don't know how this was suppose to work.

",22,46,3,14,Amy,Amy10048,Amy," Hooray! Look at all these presents!
",37,46,3,14,All,Zoidberg10049,Zoidberg," I hope we all have as much tomorrow at my birth--
",51,46,3,14,Amy,Zoidberg10050,Zoidberg," What?
",7,46,3,14,Zoidberg,Fry10051,Fry," Psst! Leela. I've set up a time-proof shelter in the closet. There's only room for two, and you're the one I wanna share it with.
",131,46,3,14,Zoidberg,Leela10052,Leela," Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see.
",35,46,3,14,Fry,Leela10053,Leela," How exactly will this protect us from time jumps?
",51,46,3,14,Leela,Fry10054,Fry,"  Because when we're together in here, baby, time will stand still.
",68,46,3,14,Leela,Fry10055,Fry," Ow!
",5,46,3,14,Fry,Zoidberg10056,Zoidberg," Hmm.  Hmm.
",12,46,3,14,Fry,Leela10057,Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?
",44,46,3,14,Zoidberg,Zoidberg10058,Zoidberg," Leela, I would be honoured.
",29,46,3,14,Leela,Leela10059,Leela," --does the worst W.C. Fields imitation I've ever seen. Zoidberg!
",66,46,3,14,Zoidberg,Zoidberg10060,Zoidberg," Sorry, you must have been boring me.
",38,46,3,14,Leela,Leela10061,Leela," The thing is, Fry is very sweet, but he's so immature. I love his boyish charm but I hate his childishness.
",109,46,3,14,Zoidberg,Zoidberg10062,Zoidberg," So he's not perfect. You don't wanna end up old and lonely like Zoidberg!  You were saying?
",93,46,3,14,Leela,Farnsworth10063,Farnsworth," Ah, there is it. The Tempus Nebula. Take a whiff through the Smellescope.
",75,46,3,14,Zoidberg,Tate10064,Tate," What's that funky jazz?
",25,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10065,Farnsworth," The odour of pure time leaking. When my crew removed the Chronitons, it destabilised the nebula, causing time skips throughout the universe.
",142,46,3,14,Tate,Bender10066,Bender," Ooh! Let Bubblegum tell it.
",29,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Tate10067,Tate," Pretend these basketballs are time particles, my silver honky. As the nebula bounce-passes them off us ...  ... they cause these dents, or ""time skips"".
",154,46,3,14,Bender,Bender10068,Bender," You are so smart!
",19,46,3,14,Tate,Tate10069,Tate," Hold up. What if we were to move this cluster of starts to these algebraic co-ordinates?
",90,46,3,14,Bender,Farnsworth10070,Farnsworth," Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of the universe.
",83,46,3,14,Tate,Tate10071,Tate," Yeah. But is it possible? Moving stars would require one bad-ass gravity pump. And we'd need all the money on Earth to--
",122,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Tate10072,Tate," What the--
",12,46,3,14,Tate,Farnsworth10073,Farnsworth," Wha?
",6,46,3,14,Tate,Nixon10074,Nixon," Here's the funding for your gravity pump. But it damn well better work! We can't spend all of Earth's money every day. Now, how long will it take to build?
",157,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Tate10075,Tate," It won't be easy, Nixon. A jim-jam this complex might take months or even--
",77,46,3,14,Nixon,Farnsworth10076,Farnsworth," Ah, there we are. One gravity pump.  Powerful enough to move the stars themselves. Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th--
",150,46,3,14,Tate,Farnsworth10077,Farnsworth,"  Off you go, apparently.
",26,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Tate10078,Tate,"  Easy, Leela. Just finger-roll that star to the cosmic basket.
",64,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Leela10079,Leela," Just a few ... more ... hundred ... thousand ... miles. There!
",64,46,3,14,Tate,Tate10080,Tate,"  Nothing but nebula!
",22,46,3,14,Leela,Leela10081,Leela," We'll have to run some tests back on Earth, but I think we've stopped the time skips.
",87,46,3,14,Tate,Bender10082,Bender," Alright!
",10,46,3,14,Leela,Tate10083,Tate," Jamming!
",10,46,3,14,Bender,Fry10084,Fry," Hooray for Leela!
",19,46,3,14,Tate,Bender10085,Bender," And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum the Globetrotter uniform I made myself!
",115,46,3,14,Fry,Tate10086,Tate," Let me see.  Hello, lawsuit!
",30,46,3,14,Bender,Fry10087,Fry," Leela, I want you to know I think the way you moved those stars around was really wonderful. I got you something.
",115,46,3,14,Tate,Leela10088,Leela," Moderately-priced, domestic, non-vintage champagne? How did you know?
",71,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10089,Fry," You deserve it. I mean, nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are.
",85,46,3,14,Leela,Leela10090,Leela," Aw! That is so true and sweet.
",32,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10091,Fry," You're smart, you're beautiful, and best of all, you'll go out with me-e?
",75,46,3,14,Leela,Leela10092,Leela," Fry, please try to understand: You're a man, I'm a woman. We're just too different.
",85,46,3,14,Fry,Bender10093,Bender," Hey, Leela. Bubblegum might let me organise a bake sale for the Globetrotter wives. Can you teach me to make cupcakes?
",120,46,3,14,Leela,Leela10094,Leela," Alright, but I wanna lick the beaters.
",40,46,3,14,Bender,Fry10095,Fry," I got her champagne, I opened it. What does a guy have to do?
",63,46,3,14,Leela,Tate10096,Tate," 86 the chump stuff, F-man. It's time to win Leela's heart with a big-showy, three-point romantic gesture.
",107,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10097,Fry," Hmm. Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise.
",61,46,3,14,Tate,Leela10098,Leela," Fry, what are you doing?
",26,46,3,14,Fry,Tate10099,Tate," Uh-oh. Time to boogie on down to the sauna!
",45,46,3,14,Leela,Fry10100,Fry," Look. I've been studying how to pilot the ship. Impressed?
",60,46,3,14,Tate,Leela10101,Leela," Yeah, actually. You're doing OK. The core reactor temperature's nominal, the blinker's off.
",93,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10102,Fry," I learned how to work the gravity pump too. In case we need to move more stars. So, are we dating now?
",104,46,3,14,Leela,Leela10103,Leela," Is that what this is all about? Please, just cut it out now.
",62,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10104,Fry," Look, Leela. I know there's some perfect, amazing thing I can do to make you love me, and when I figure out what it is--
",122,46,3,14,Leela,Leela10105,Leela," Fry, stop. I don't wanna hurt you, but there is absolutely, positively no way that you and I will ever, ever--
",112,46,3,14,Fry,Preacherbot10106,Preacherbot," --man and wife. You may kiss the bride.
",41,46,3,14,Leela,Albert10107,Albert," Yes!
",6,46,3,14,Preacherbot,Zoidberg10108,Zoidberg," He looks radiant!
",19,46,3,14,Albert,Farnsworth10109,Farnsworth," Ye Gods, Bubblegum! We failed. The time skips haven't stopped at all.
",71,46,3,14,Zoidberg,Tate10110,Tate," Even in these formal shorts, I feel like a failure.
",53,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Leela10111,Leela," You tricked me into marrying you, didn't you?
",47,46,3,14,Tate,Fry10112,Fry," Of course not.
",16,46,3,14,Leela,Leela10113,Leela," How'd you do it? Drugs in the champagne? Hypnosis?
",52,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10114,Fry," No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big, weird eyebrows. I don't know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but, whatever it was, we're married now. We've got the rest of our lives to work--
",221,46,3,14,Leela,Whitey10115,Whitey," Divorce is final.
",19,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10116,Fry," What?
",7,46,3,14,Whitey,Leela10117,Leela," Well, let's divide up the china. I guess I'll take the NFC helmets and you can have the AFC helmets.
",102,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10118,Fry," Fine. Break my heart again.
",29,46,3,14,Leela,Zoidberg10119,Zoidberg," Don't be so hard on yourself, Fry. You lost the woman of your dreams but you still have Zoidberg. You all still have Zoidberg.
",128,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10120,Fry," How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure it out.
",77,46,3,14,Zoidberg,Hermes10121,Hermes," Maybe you're just a fantastic lover, Fry.
",43,46,3,14,Fry,Amy10122,Amy," Um, no.
",9,46,3,14,Hermes,Fry10123,Fry," I don't know what I'm doing.
",30,46,3,14,Amy,Bender10124,Bender," Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What do you say, Bubblegum?
",106,46,3,14,Fry,Tate10125,Tate," Hell, no.
",11,46,3,14,Bender,Fry10126,Fry," Oh, it's hopeless. I did something so great that it won Leela's heart and I'll never, ever know what it was. My life is empty.
",128,46,3,14,Tate,Zoidberg10127,Zoidberg,"  Zoidberg!
",12,46,3,14,Fry,Farnsworth10128,Farnsworth," No wonder we failed to stop the time skips. Diverting Chronitons is mathematically impossible. I knew I should have checked your show-boating Globetrotter algebra.
",165,46,3,14,Zoidberg,Tate10129,Tate," Man, I thought you knew that algebra was all razz-ma-tazz. A Globetrotter always saves the good algebra for the final minutes.
",128,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Bender10130,Bender," Vintage Bubblegum!
",20,46,3,14,Tate,Farnsworth10131,Farnsworth," The time skips are worse than ever now. Isolated spots are jumping by years at a time. Look.
",94,46,3,14,Bender,Boy10132,Boy," Stupid senior citizens. Why should we have to pay for their social security benefits?
",87,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Old Man #110133,Old Man #1," I deserve free money!
",23,46,3,14,Boy,Farnsworth10134,Farnsworth," Well, I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the finest scientific minds in the univ--
",84,46,3,14,Old Man #1,Farnsworth10135,Farnsworth," Perhaps we could explode the whole damned nebula. What do you think, Curly Joe?
",81,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Curly Joe10136,Curly Joe," No, man. An explosion big enough to destroy that mama would take out half the universe.
",89,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Sweet Clyde10137,Sweet Clyde," You gotta Globetrotter that explosion up a little, Farnsy. Make it an implosion.
",82,46,3,14,Curly Joe,Farnsworth10138,Farnsworth," By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion might just form a black hole that would stop more Chronitons from escaping.
",120,46,3,14,Sweet Clyde,Tate10139,Tate," Whoa. Slow that brain train down, Prof. We'd need some kind of doomsday device to initiate an implosion like that.
",116,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10140,Farnsworth," Doomsday device? Ah! Now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!  I suppose I could part with one and still be feared.
",114,46,3,14,Tate,Tate10141,Tate," Give me some skin, Prof. I'm making you an honorary Globetrotter. In fact, everybody in this room's an honorary Globetrotter.
",127,46,3,14,Farnsworth,Amy10142,Amy," Hooray!
",9,46,3,14,Tate,Hermes10143,Hermes," Yes!
",6,46,3,14,Amy,Zoidberg10144,Zoidberg," I'm a Globetrotter!
",21,46,3,14,Hermes,Bender10145,Bender,"  Did you just say--
",21,46,3,14,Zoidberg,Tate10146,Tate," Too late, hot plate.
",22,46,3,14,Bender,Bender10147,Bender," Oh, crap.
",11,46,3,14,Tate,Tate10148,Tate," We must leave now, for we are needed elsewhere. But we wish you Godspeed.
",75,46,3,14,Bender,Bender10149,Bender," Please, please let me come with you. I can make myself taller.
",64,46,3,14,Tate,Tate10150,Tate," Bender, you can talk trash, you can handle the ball. But look in your heart and ask yourself: Are you funky enough to be a Globetrotter? Are you?
",147,46,3,14,Bender,Bender10151,Bender," Yes.
",6,46,3,14,Tate,Tate10152,Tate," Are you?
",10,46,3,14,Bender,Bender10153,Bender," I mean, with time, my funk level could--
",42,46,3,14,Tate,Tate10154,Tate," Are you?
",10,46,3,14,Bender,Bender10155,Bender,"  No.
",6,46,3,14,Tate,Tate10156,Tate," Deal with it.
",15,46,3,14,Bender,Bender10157,Bender," Oh! No!
",9,46,3,14,Tate,Leela10158,Leela,"  Careful with that doomsday device, Bender.
",45,46,3,14,Bender,Bender10159,Bender," What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, everyone else's, is meaningless.
",113,46,3,14,Leela,Leela10160,Leela,"  Roger.
",9,46,3,14,Bender,Fry10161,Fry," Leela, about the wedding. I don't know what I did to make you love me, and I don't think I tricked you into it, but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm sorry.
",155,46,3,14,Leela,Leela10162,Leela," It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always be friends, right?
",56,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10163,Fry," Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could do will ever make you feel the same way about me that I do about you.
",112,46,3,14,Leela,Leela10164,Leela," I guess not.
",14,46,3,14,Fry,Bender10165,Bender," Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little.
",143,46,3,14,Leela,Leela10166,Leela," OK. Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance.  Actually, I think I'll go down and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm?
",145,46,3,14,Bender,Fry10167,Fry," She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will.
",122,46,3,14,Leela,Bender10168,Bender," Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve.
",77,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10169,Fry," Oh!  That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky.
",104,46,3,14,Bender,Leela10170,Leela,"  Detonation in three, two, one.
",33,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10171,Fry,"  No!  Did you see it? Did you see it?
",39,46,3,14,Leela,Bender10172,Bender," The explosion?
",16,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10173,Fry," No, not the explosion!
",24,46,3,14,Bender,Leela10174,Leela," Then what?
",12,46,3,14,Fry,Fry10175,Fry,"  Nothing.
",11,46,3,14,Leela,Narrator10176,Narrator,"  You're entering a realm which is unusual. Maybe it's magic or contains some kind of monster. The second one. Prepare to enter ... The Scary Door.  Please send a man round back and pick up Clyde Smith, a professional gambler who's about to have an unfortunate accident.
",271,47,3,15,Fry,Smith10177,Smith,"  A casino where I'm winning? That car musta killed me. I must be in heaven!  A casino where I always win? That's boring. I must really be ... in hell!
",152,47,3,15,Narrator,Sebastian Cabot10178,Sebastian Cabot,"  No, Mr. Smith. You're not in heaven or hell. You're on an aeroplane.
",71,47,3,15,Smith,Smith10179,Smith,"  There's a gremlin destroying the plane! You've gotta believe me!
",67,47,3,15,Sebastian Cabot,Sebastian Cabot10180,Sebastian Cabot,"  Why should I believe you? You're Hitler!
",43,47,3,15,Smith,Smith10181,Smith,"  No!  Eva Braun! Help me!
",27,47,3,15,Sebastian Cabot,Bender10182,Bender," Saw it comin'!
",16,47,3,15,Smith,Fry10183,Fry," I just saw something incredibly cool: A big, floating ball that lit up with every colour in the rainbow, plus some new ones that were so beautiful I fell to my knees and cried.
",178,47,3,15,Bender,Amy10184,Amy," Was it out in front of Discount Shoe Outlet?
",46,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10185,Fry," Yeah.
",7,47,3,15,Amy,Amy10186,Amy," They have a college kid wear that to attract customers.
",57,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10187,Fry," Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment I felt the heartbeat of creation, and it was one with my own.
",136,47,3,15,Amy,Amy10188,Amy," Big deal!
",11,47,3,15,Fry,Bender10189,Bender," We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about it.
",76,47,3,15,Amy,Fry10190,Fry," How can you people be so blasÃ©? Here you are in the year 3000 or so, yet you just sit around like it's the boring time I came from.
",133,47,3,15,Bender,Farnsworth10191,Farnsworth," Boring? Wasn't that the period when they cracked the human genome and boy bands roamed the Earth?
",99,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10192,Fry," Yeah. But now it's the distant future. Why aren't we out doing everything I ever dreamed of?
",94,47,3,15,Farnsworth,Leela10193,Leela," Hey, you know what might be a hoot?
",37,47,3,15,Fry,Farnsworth10194,Farnsworth," No. Why would I know that?
",28,47,3,15,Leela,Leela10195,Leela," Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything he ever wanted to do.
",92,47,3,15,Farnsworth,Fry10196,Fry,"  Everything?
",14,47,3,15,Leela,Leela10197,Leela," Except that.
",14,47,3,15,Fry,Sal10198,Sal," Sos your fantasies has always been to destroys a planet, huh?
",63,47,3,15,Leela,Fry10199,Fry," Yeah, what did they ever do for me?
",37,47,3,15,Sal,Leela10200,Leela," Wow! The most humdrum activities look almost exciting through your eyes. What should we do next?
",98,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10201,Fry," I wanna see the edge of the universe!
",39,47,3,15,Leela,Amy10202,Amy," Ooh! That sounds cool.
",24,47,3,15,Fry,Zoidberg10203,Zoidberg," It's funny. You live in the universe, but you never do these things till someone comes to visit.
",98,47,3,15,Amy,Farnsworth10204,Farnsworth,"  There it is! The edge of the universe!
",41,47,3,15,Zoidberg,Fry10205,Fry," Far out! So there's an infinite number of parallel universes?
",63,47,3,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10206,Farnsworth," No, just the two.
",19,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10207,Fry," Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough.
",35,47,3,15,Farnsworth,Bender10208,Bender," I'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy hat over me! Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy.

",60,47,3,15,Bender,Girl10210,Girl," Mommy, why is that man like that?
",35,47,3,15,Fry,Mother10211,Mother," Don't look at him!
",20,47,3,15,Girl,Fry10212,Fry," That was fun. Let's give him a treat!

",42,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10217,Fry," I've only got two fantasies left: Be invisible in a chocolate factory and be romantically linked with a celebrity.
",116,47,3,15,Farnsworth,Bender10218,Bender," I could pound your head till you think that's what happened.
",62,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10219,Fry," OK.
",5,47,3,15,Bender,Leela10220,Leela," Wait, hold on. It is actually possible to meet any celebrity you want.
",72,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10221,Fry," It is?
",8,47,3,15,Leela,Leela10222,Leela," Of course! You should read a blimp sometime.
",46,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10223,Fry,"  Download a celebrity from the Internet? What part of that do I understand?
",77,47,3,15,Leela,Leela10224,Leela," It's simple. You can download a celebrity's personality and appearance into a blank robot.
",92,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10225,Fry," Hey, I have an idea. Let's do that!
",37,47,3,15,Leela,Farnsworth10226,Farnsworth," Onto the Internet you go!
",27,47,3,15,Fry,Bender10227,Bender," Oh, and while you're there, pick me up a few credit card numbers.

",40,47,3,15,Auctioneer,Leela10236,Leela," Let's search the web.  Over there.
",36,47,3,15,Fry,Salesman #110237,Salesman #1," Welcome to Nappster. Let's see what celebrities we've got in stock.  Can I interest you in Gwyneth Paltrow?
",109,47,3,15,Leela,Fry10238,Fry," Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks human blood.
",54,47,3,15,Salesman #1,Salesman #110239,Salesman #1," Then, uh, how about Cleopatra, whose beauty destroyed mighty empires.
",71,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10240,Fry," I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved underarms. Do you have anything with more of a Lucy-Liu-feel to it?
",111,47,3,15,Salesman #1,Salesman #110241,Salesman #1," Nah, nothing like that. Though we do have Lucy Liu.  Only woman ever to be named People magazine's sexiest woman of the year twice. In 2003, and then again in 2063.
",166,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10242,Fry," I'd like the 2003 model.
",26,47,3,15,Salesman #1,Fry10243,Fry," I've found her! What do I do now?
",35,47,3,15,Fry,Farnsworth10244,Farnsworth," Download her. Let's just put a blank robot in the drive.
",58,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10245,Fry," It worked!
",12,47,3,15,Farnsworth,Liubot10246,Liubot," You're one sexy man,  Philip J. Fry.
",38,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10247,Fry,"  It worked perfectly!
",23,47,3,15,Liubot,Leela10248,Leela," Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu. Are you just going to stare vacantly at her and not say anything?
",98,47,3,15,Fry,Liubot10249,Liubot," I find your slack-jawed stare very attractive,  Philip J. Fry.
",64,47,3,15,Leela,Fry10250,Fry," Did you hear that? She likes me!
",34,47,3,15,Liubot,Farnsworth10251,Farnsworth," Well, duh! She's programmed to like you!
",42,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10252,Fry," But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only good actress of the 21st century! She's more than just a piece of software.
",116,47,3,15,Farnsworth,Liubot10253,Liubot," Would you like to take a moment to register me?
",49,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10254,Fry," Uh, not right now.
",20,47,3,15,Liubot,Liubot10255,Liubot," I'll remind you later, you hot stud, you!
",43,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10256,Fry," So, uh, what do you feel like doing?
",38,47,3,15,Liubot,Liubot10257,Liubot," Would you like to take a moment to register me?
",49,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10258,Fry," I said later!
",15,47,3,15,Liubot,Fry10259,Fry," Then when I feel so stuffed I can't eat anymore, I just use the restroom, and then I can eat more.
",100,47,3,15,Fry,Liubot10260,Liubot," You should write a book, Fry. People need to know about the  can eat more.
",76,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10261,Fry," Oh, Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies.
",72,47,3,15,Liubot,Liubot10262,Liubot," My personality is mathematically derived from my movies, proportionally weighted by box office receipts.

",6,47,3,15,Liubot,Farnsworth10270,Farnsworth," Oh, dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop and he's an idiot. Well, that's love for you.
",89,47,3,15,Fry,Bender10271,Bender," Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
",129,47,3,15,Farnsworth,Leela10272,Leela," Bender, this is Fry's decision ... and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.
",104,47,3,15,Bender,Leela10273,Leela," She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that--
",69,47,3,15,Leela,Bender10274,Bender,"  Stay away from our women! You got metal fever, boy! Metal fever!
",67,47,3,15,Leela,Fry10275,Fry," Well, so what if I love a robot? It's not hurting anybody.
",60,47,3,15,Bender,Hermes10276,Hermes," My God! He never took middle school hygiene. He never saw the propaganda film.
",80,47,3,15,Fry,Farnsworth10277,Farnsworth," It's just lucky I keep a copy in the VCR at all times.
",56,47,3,15,Hermes,Narrator10278,Narrator,"  Ordinary human dating. It's enjoyable and it serves an important purpose.  But when a human dates an artificial mate, there is no purpose. Only enjoyment. And that leads to ... tragedy.
",188,47,3,15,Farnsworth,Billy10279,Billy,"  Neat-o! A Marilyn Monroe-bot!
",32,47,3,15,Narrator,Monroe-bot10280,Monroe-bot,"  Ooh! You're a real dreamboat,  Billy Everyteen.
",50,47,3,15,Billy,Narrator10281,Narrator,"  Harmless fun? Let's see what happens next.
",45,47,3,15,Monroe-bot,Billys Mom10282,Billys Mom,"  Billy, do you want to walk your dog?
",39,47,3,15,Narrator,Billy10283,Billy,"  No thanks, Mom. I'd rather make out with my Monroe-bot.
",58,47,3,15,Billys Mom,Billys Dad10284,Billys Dad,"  Billy, do want to get a paper route and earn some extra cash?
",64,47,3,15,Billy,Billy10285,Billy,"  No thanks, Dad. I'd rather make out with my Monroe-bot.
",58,47,3,15,Billys Dad,Mavis10286,Mavis,"  Billy, do you want to come over tonight? We can make out together.
",69,47,3,15,Billy,Billy10287,Billy,"  Gee, Mavis, your house is across the street. That's an awfully long way to go for making out.
",96,47,3,15,Mavis,Narrator10288,Narrator,"  Did you notice what went wrong in that scene? Ordinarily, Billy would work hard to make money from his paper route. Then he'd use the money to buy dinner for Mavis, thus earning the slim chance to perform the reproductive act. But in a world where teens can date robots, why should he bother? Why should anyone bother? Let's take a look at Billy's planet a year later.  Where are all the football stars?  And where are the biochemists?  They're trapped! Trapped in a soft, vice-like grip of robot lips. All civilisation was just an effort to impress the opposite sex ... and sometimes the same sex. Now, let's skip forward 80 years into the future. Where is Billy?
",667,47,3,15,Billy,Billy10289,Billy,"  Farewell!
",12,47,3,15,Narrator,Narrator10290,Narrator,"  The next day, Billy's planet was destroyed by aliens.  Have you guessed the name of Billy's planet? It was Earth. Don't date robots!
",135,47,3,15,Billy,Announcer #110291,Announcer #1,"  Brought to you by the Space Pope.
",36,47,3,15,Narrator,Leela10292,Leela," Did that make any impression on you, Fry? Fry?
",48,47,3,15,Announcer #1,Liubot10293,Liubot," Ooh!
",6,47,3,15,Leela,Farnsworth10294,Farnsworth," I knew I should have shown him Electro Gonorrhoea: The Noisy Killer.
",70,47,3,15,Liubot,Bender10295,Bender," What is the world coming to? That Fry's a sicko poivert, I tell you. Dating a robot! It's an atrosmacy!
",105,47,3,15,Farnsworth,Leela10296,Leela," But Fry's our friend, Bender.
",31,47,3,15,Bender,Bender10297,Bender," Aw, jeez, would you stifle there, meatbag?
",44,47,3,15,Leela,Leela10298,Leela," You stifle, Bender.
",21,47,3,15,Bender,Zoidberg10299,Zoidberg," Hooray! Finally you're standing up to him.
",44,47,3,15,Leela,Leela10300,Leela," Although he is completely right.
",34,47,3,15,Zoidberg,Bender10301,Bender," We've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay. It's time to shut down nappster.com!

",31,47,3,15,Bender,Jeff Jervis10303,Jeff Jervis,"  That'd be me. If you're an investor you can dump your money in the hole there.

",32,47,3,15,Jeff Jervis,Jeff Jervis10305,Jeff Jervis," Listening.
",12,47,3,15,Bender,Bender10306,Bender," Your company promotes wrong love! If you don't shut down right now the only thing wired about you will be your jaw!
",117,47,3,15,Jeff Jervis,Jeff Jervis10307,Jeff Jervis," Y-You can't shut us down. The Internet is about the free exchange and sale of other people's ideas. We've done nothing wrong.

",33,47,3,15,Jeff Jervis,Zoidberg10309,Zoidberg," Someone in trouble is!
",24,47,3,15,Liu,Jeff Jervis10310,Jeff Jervis," No, stay out! There's a ... guy going for the Tetris world record in there!

",75,47,3,15,Liu,Bender10315,Bender," So what's your problem?
",25,47,3,15,Zoidberg,Liu10316,Liu," Those sweaty nerds are making illegal copies of us.   It hurts!
",65,47,3,15,Bender,Jeff Jervis10317,Jeff Jervis,"  Open this door! Don't make me call the maintenance guy.
",58,47,3,15,Liu,Bender10318,Bender," It's a bluff!
",15,47,3,15,Jeff Jervis,Leela10319,Leela," We can't take that chance. Move, people, move!
",48,47,3,15,Bender,Michael10320,Michael," Please pick me up before you go-go.
",37,47,3,15,Leela,Leela10321,Leela," She asked first.

",7,47,3,15,Nerd #1,Jeff Jervis10324,Jeff Jervis," Oh, we're doomed. They got the head, they uncovered the sign! Soon the whole world will learn we're cyber-criminals. And we would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling adults.

",115,47,3,15,Jeff Jervis,Zoidberg10326,Zoidberg," Did you see me escaping? I was all like--
",43,47,3,15,Man #1,Liu10327,Liu," Thanks for rescuing me. Especially you, Bender.  Mmm. Quite a masculine piece of metal, aren't you?
",101,47,3,15,Zoidberg,Bender10328,Bender," Hey! Don't look at me like that. If you're thinking of crossing the line with Bender, you can forget it. Bender don't bend that way.
",134,47,3,15,Liu,Leela10329,Leela," Hey, look. It's another Lucy Liubot.
",38,47,3,15,Bender,Liubot #210330,Liubot #2,"  I am Lucy Liu. Give me your spines.

",62,47,3,15,Liu,Bender10335,Bender," Then along came Bender.
",25,47,3,15,Leela,Zoidberg10336,Zoidberg," Looks like you're retaining water.
",36,47,3,15,Bender,Liu10337,Liu," That was incredible, Bender. You're like Jackie Chan before he got all doughy.
",80,47,3,15,Zoidberg,Bender10338,Bender," Oh, shucks! I wasn't afraid of that robot. I'm pretty brave once you get past my macho exterior!  It's an army of Lucy Lius!
",126,47,3,15,Liu,Liu10339,Liu," They're horrible!
",19,47,3,15,Bender,Liubots10340,Liubots,"  Take this and that and one of these.
",39,47,3,15,Liu,Liubot #310341,Liubot #3,"  Robot crouching tiger.

",10,47,3,15,Zapp,Fry10345,Fry," This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has a vampire and an explosion!
",75,47,3,15,Liubot #5,Liubot10346,Liubot," It's amazing the way you  notice two things.
",46,47,3,15,Fry,Alex10347,Alex,"  No, don't open that coffin! It's ticking!
",44,47,3,15,Liubot,Natalie10348,Natalie,"  I have to, Alex. That coffin's not going to open itself.
",59,47,3,15,Alex,Vampire10349,Vampire,"  Bleurh!
",10,47,3,15,Natalie,Liu10350,Liu," Let's hide in here. It'll add to my box office gross.
",55,47,3,15,Vampire,Leela10351,Leela," Fry?
",6,47,3,15,Liu,Fry10352,Fry," Aw, you guys came to watch me make out! That is so sweet.  Wait a minute! Is that the head of who I think it's of?
",116,47,3,15,Leela,Liu10353,Liu," Read the jar, Evelyn Wood! Dr. Z?
",35,47,3,15,Fry,Leela10354,Leela," Fry, a herd of Lucy Liu are destroying the city. Is yours acting normally?
",76,47,3,15,Liu,Fry10355,Fry," Let me see.  Yep. Why do you ask?
",35,47,3,15,Leela,Alex10356,Alex,"  Mr. Mayor, if you want to see a real vampire, look in the mirror!
",68,47,3,15,Fry,Mayor10357,Mayor,"  I can't! I'm a vampire!
",26,47,3,15,Alex,Zoidberg10358,Zoidberg," Why?
",6,47,3,15,Mayor,Leela10359,Leela," And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody.
",54,47,3,15,Zoidberg,Fry10360,Fry,"  Quick! This way!
",19,47,3,15,Leela,Fry10361,Fry," Sorry, ladies. Employees only.
",32,47,3,15,Fry,Leela10362,Leela," Oh, no. They're forming a human pyramid ... of robots.
",56,47,3,15,Fry,Bender10363,Bender," Damnit! We weren't counting on them being as smart as they are sexy!
",70,47,3,15,Leela,Liu10364,Liu," A dangerous mistake to make.
",30,47,3,15,Bender,Zoidberg10365,Zoidberg," At least we've got food.
",26,47,3,15,Liu,Leela10366,Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, cut open that bag!
",34,47,3,15,Zoidberg,Zoidberg10367,Zoidberg," Hooray!
",9,47,3,15,Leela,Leela10368,Leela," And don't eat it.
",19,47,3,15,Zoidberg,Liubot #210369,Liubot #2,"  Ow!
",6,47,3,15,Leela,Liubot #310370,Liubot #3,"  System overload!
",19,47,3,15,Liubot #2,Liubot #410371,Liubot #4,"  Error!

",59,47,3,15,Zoidberg,Fry10375,Fry," Lucy Liubot, if I don't survive the corn, I want you to know that I love you as much as a man can love a computerised image of gorgeous celebrity. Which it turns out is a lot.
",177,47,3,15,Bender,Liubot10376,Liubot," Oh, Fry, I love you more than the moon and the stars and the  poetic image number 37 not found.
",97,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10377,Fry," What are you doing, darling? Get down!
",40,47,3,15,Liubot,Liubot #310378,Liubot #3,"  Light hot. Oil temperature rising.

",10,47,3,15,Liubot #3,Liubot #510380,Liubot #5,"  Malfunction.
",15,47,3,15,Liubot #4,Liubot #610381,Liubot #6,"  This ain't good.

",32,47,3,15,Liubot #7,Liubot10384,Liubot," Yes, my love. I'll be just  massive corn clog in port seven.
",62,47,3,15,Fry,Liu10385,Liu," Are you the last copy of me?
",30,47,3,15,Liubot,Liubot10386,Liubot," Yes.
",6,47,3,15,Liu,Liu10387,Liu," Erase her, Fry.
",17,47,3,15,Liubot,Fry10388,Fry," What? No!
",11,47,3,15,Liu,Liu10389,Liu," Fry, when you downloaded her without my permission, you stole my image, and in the end that's all I really have. That and the largest gold nugget in the world, one mile in diameter.
",183,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10390,Fry," But I just downloaded her because I love you.
",47,47,3,15,Liu,Liu10391,Liu," If you love the real Lucy Liu and not just what you've seen in movies, genre-straddling lawyer shows and kiss-ass articles in People magazine, you'll blank out that robot.
",173,47,3,15,Fry,Fry10392,Fry," I'm sorry. Hug me, Liubot.
",28,47,3,15,Liu,Liubot10393,Liubot," I'll always remember you, Fry--  Memory deleted.
",50,47,3,15,Fry,Bender10394,Bender," I know it hurts, buddy. But at least you're not in a sick relationship with a robot anymore.
",94,47,3,15,Liubot,Fry10395,Fry," Uh-huh. And I guess now maybe I can get to know the real Lucy Liu.
",68,47,3,15,Bender,Bender10396,Bender," Pft! Yeah, at our wedding!
",28,47,3,15,Fry,Liu10397,Liu," It's true. Bender and I are in love.
",38,47,3,15,Bender,Fry10398,Fry," But, but--
",12,47,3,15,Liu,Bender10399,Bender," Don't be a prude, Fry!
",24,47,3,15,Fry,Leela10400,Leela," Oh, put down the binoculars, Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse twice in one day.
",105,48,3,16,Bender,Fry10401,Fry," I know, and I've grown to accept that. Now I'm more interested in that new pizza parlour across the street. Kinda makes me pine for my days as a pizza delivery boy. ""Here's you pizza,"" I'd say. ""I didn't order any,"" they'd say. And then I'd be off to my next adventure.
",271,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10402,Leela," That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars.  I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.
",80,48,3,16,Fry,Farnsworth10403,Farnsworth," Cygnoids? On our block? Flying foo! They should go back where they came from.
",79,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10404,Leela," Professor, please! Society's never gonna make any progress until we all learn to pretend to like each other. Now let's go over there and make these hideous strangers feel welcome.
",181,48,3,16,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10405,Farnsworth," No!
",5,48,3,16,Leela,Blek10406,Blek," You sure about these chairs? Guidebook says human legs bend down at knee.
",75,48,3,16,Farnsworth,Blek10407,Blek," It's OK, Mama. Anyone complains, I bend legs up for free.  Ooh! Customers!  Welcome to Earth pizza store. Here, sit. I bend knees for you.
",140,48,3,16,Blek,Bender10408,Bender," Ooh! That's a-comfy!
",22,48,3,16,Blek,Blek10409,Blek," OK, now, what kind of pizza goes in you?  Silt? Asbestos? We got guano -- very fresh!
",87,48,3,16,Bender,Fry10410,Fry," Uh ... hmm ... do you have any food?
",38,48,3,16,Blek,Blek10411,Blek," Here, try a deep dish pizza.  Contains four kind of things.
",61,48,3,16,Fry,Leela10412,Leela," I don't mean to offend, but this tastes like vomit.
",53,48,3,16,Blek,Cygnoid Woman #110413,Cygnoid Woman #1,"  Thank you.
",13,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10414,Leela," No, actually, I did mean to offend a little. This is awful.
",61,48,3,16,Cygnoid Woman #1,Fry10415,Fry," Hey, hey. What's wrong? Was it something Leela said?
",54,48,3,16,Leela,Cygnoid Woman #110416,Cygnoid Woman #1,"  We come to Earth to start new life. Raise fat spoiled Earth kids, hang many underwear from Earth clothesline, live Earthican dream.
",134,48,3,16,Fry,Fry10417,Fry," Aw. Don't cry, foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza, Earth style!
",164,48,3,16,Cygnoid Woman #1,Cygnoid Woman #110418,Cygnoid Woman #1," Oh, thank you, magic biped!
",29,48,3,16,Fry,Blek10419,Blek," You save us, a-sir. If we cannot make Earth pizza our dream will die. Just like rats we crushed to make the wine.
",115,48,3,16,Cygnoid Woman #1,Fry10420,Fry," For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point: No more live bees.  Oregano works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven, don't get in with them.
",169,48,3,16,Blek,Cygnoid #210421,Cygnoid #2," Hey, ocupado!
",15,48,3,16,Fry,Fry10422,Fry," Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV when they're eating so they don't have to talk to each other.  Ah, the Earthican pastime: Blernsball!
",172,48,3,16,Cygnoid #2,Uecker10423,Uecker,"  Mulligan drives the ball. It's going, going and caught by the shortstop. Mets lose again. Man, I haven't seen play this bad since the days of Bob Uecker! This is Bob Uecker saying thanks for watching!
",203,48,3,16,Fry,Blek10424,Blek," Mets? Shortstop? Pinching the hitter? I don't understand this ""blernsball"".
",77,48,3,16,Uecker,Fry10425,Fry," Well, if you're going to be Earthicans, we'll have to teach you. How about your pizzeria plays a game against Planet Express? Oh, but you'll need nine players.
",161,48,3,16,Blek,Cygnoid Woman #110426,Cygnoid Woman #1," No problem!
",13,48,3,16,Fry,Cygnoid #210427,Cygnoid #2," Play the ball!
",16,48,3,16,Cygnoid Woman #1,Farnsworth10428,Farnsworth,"  Go, team! Beat those no good Cygnoids! Show them they stink at a game they've never played before!
",101,48,3,16,Cygnoid #2,Blek10429,Blek," Ah, this is why I love Earth! Beautiful star-brightened day, friendly blernsball game with chum pals! So pleasant for everybody.
",130,48,3,16,Farnsworth,Scruffy10430,Scruffy," Hit by a pitch. Take your base.
",33,48,3,16,Blek,Leela10431,Leela,"  Sorry about that. I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches.
",65,48,3,16,Scruffy,Bender10432,Bender," No batter! No batter!  No batter anymore.
",43,48,3,16,Leela,Scruffy10433,Scruffy," Take your base.
",17,48,3,16,Bender,Leela10434,Leela,"  I didn't mean to hit you. I have some trouble with depth perception.
",71,48,3,16,Scruffy,Cygnoid #210435,Cygnoid #2," Yeah, me too now.
",19,48,3,16,Leela,Bender10436,Bender," Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter!  Duck!
",87,48,3,16,Cygnoid #2,Scruffy10437,Scruffy," Take your base.
",17,48,3,16,Bender,Cygnoid #310438,Cygnoid #3," Please, lady, I want to live. Can I use bat to protect head?
",62,48,3,16,Scruffy,Bender10439,Bender," Apparently not.
",17,48,3,16,Cygnoid #3,Man #110440,Man #1," Check out the one-eyed bean machine!
",38,48,3,16,Bender,Blek10441,Blek," Hooray! I make a score point!
",31,48,3,16,Man #1,Fry10442,Fry," Leela, you beaned a run-in. You'd better let me pitch.
",56,48,3,16,Blek,Leela10443,Leela," But I've got a no-hitter going.  You're right. Here.
",54,48,3,16,Fry,Randy10444,Randy," Don't take her out, she's a firecracker!
",42,48,3,16,Leela,Doubledeal10445,Doubledeal," Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you.
",37,48,3,16,Randy,Leela10446,Leela," Am I under arrest?
",20,48,3,16,Doubledeal,Bender10447,Bender," Wait! I know you. You're the sleazebag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
",85,48,3,16,Leela,Doubledeal10448,Doubledeal," Not anymore. Now I'm the sleazebag who owns the New New York Mets.
",68,48,3,16,Bender,Leela10449,Leela," The Mets? Those bums are worse than me.
",41,48,3,16,Doubledeal,Doubledeal10450,Doubledeal," Close to it. But they don't draw a crowd like you. Which is why I wanna sign you to the team.
",95,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10451,Leela," You mean I'd be the first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball?
",71,48,3,16,Doubledeal,Commissioner10452,Commissioner," Well, yeah, but basically you'd just be a publicity stunt. I figure a one-eyed lady skull-buster might bring out the freakshow crowd.
",135,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10453,Leela," Wow! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball.
",60,48,3,16,Commissioner,Commissioner10454,Commissioner," Again, yeah, but basically you'd just be--
",44,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10455,Leela," Ta-da! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball. How do I look?
",77,48,3,16,Commissioner,Hermes10456,Hermes," Like a sexy Yogi Berra!
",25,48,3,16,Leela,Farnsworth10457,Farnsworth," Why is your number seven-eighth's?
",36,48,3,16,Hermes,Leela10458,Leela," All the whole numbers have been retired.
",42,48,3,16,Farnsworth,Fry10459,Fry," Wow! I must say, I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on the butt?
",94,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10460,Leela," Fry, I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead.
",47,48,3,16,Fry,Fry10461,Fry," Oh! Now I'm too nervous.
",26,48,3,16,Leela,Uecker10462,Uecker," Well, folks, it's only the fifth inning but the Swedes have already turned this one into a ""laffer"". And that's with two F's. The crowd is pouring out of the stadium L.A.-style.
",179,48,3,16,Fry,Doubledeal10463,Doubledeal," Skipper, we're losing the crowd. Put it our new novelty act: Leela.
",69,48,3,16,Uecker,Skipper10464,Skipper," Darn it! I already put in the circus clown.
",45,48,3,16,Doubledeal,Doubledeal10465,Doubledeal," Yeah, but he bunted. Clowns are only funny when they swing away.
",66,48,3,16,Skipper,Announcer #110466,Announcer #1,"  Your attention, please. Now pitching for the Mets: Turanga Leela.  A one-eyed woman.
",87,48,3,16,Doubledeal,Woman #110467,Woman #1," Come on! Throw like a girl!
",29,48,3,16,Announcer #1,Fry10468,Fry,"  Go, Leela!
",13,48,3,16,Woman #1,Bender10469,Bender,"  Come on, girl!
",17,48,3,16,Fry,Amy10470,Amy,"  Too much eyeliner!
",21,48,3,16,Bender,Uecker10471,Uecker," This is history in the making, folks. Bjornson steps up to the plate and Leela delivers.
",90,48,3,16,Amy,Bender10472,Bender," Bullseye!
",11,48,3,16,Uecker,Uecker10473,Uecker," Ooh! An inauspicious start for the career of the first woman blernsballer.  An inauspicious continuation for the career of the first woman blernsballer.
",154,48,3,16,Bender,Crowd10474,Crowd,"  Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean!
",62,48,3,16,Uecker,Uecker10475,Uecker," Ouch! It's a three-bean-ball salad. The Mets fans love it though, and who can blame them? They haven't had much to cheer about this year--
",140,48,3,16,Crowd,Doubledeal10476,Doubledeal," Kid, that was great! You got us more publicity than a cowboy in a shark tank. Poor Tex, he was quite a shark.
",111,48,3,16,Uecker,Man #110477,Man #1," Hey!
",6,48,3,16,Doubledeal,Man #1 #210478,Man #1 #2," Hey!
",6,48,3,16,Man #1,Man #1 #310479,Man #1 #3," Come on!
",10,48,3,16,Man #1 #2,Man #1 #410480,Man #1 #4," I win!
",8,48,3,16,Man #1 #3,Bender10481,Bender," Oop! Sorry.
",13,48,3,16,Man #1 #4,Leela10482,Leela," Bender, how did you get in here?
",34,48,3,16,Bender,Bender10483,Bender,"  As your agent, I have access to you at all times.
",52,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10484,Leela," Since when are you my agent?
",30,48,3,16,Bender,Bender10485,Bender," Quiet, call coming in.  Yes? A big endorsement deal for Leela? How much? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!
",143,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10486,Leela," Bender, that's great! How much did you get me?
",48,48,3,16,Bender,Bender10487,Bender,"  One hundred dollars.
",23,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10488,Leela,"  As a pitcher, I serve up plenty of bean balls. So I know good beans when I see them. Bean-Bay Beans: They're the beaniest!
",125,48,3,16,Bender,Director #1 #110489,Director #1 #1," Cut!
",6,48,3,16,Leela,Uecker10490,Uecker," In very short order, Leela has become a fan favourite.
",56,48,3,16,Director #1 #1,Bender10491,Bender," You're the best, babe!  Hang on. Call comin' in.  What's that? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!
",133,48,3,16,Uecker,Leela10492,Leela," So what did you get me?
",25,48,3,16,Bender,Bender10493,Bender,"  A thousand and one pesos!
",28,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10494,Leela," Yo soy muy malo en lanzar, pero yo soy muy bueno en comer frijoles. Come los Bean Bay frijoles, los frijoles de los reyes.
",124,48,3,16,Bender,Director #1 #210495,Director #1 #2," Cut! OK, now do one with bean suit on!
",40,48,3,16,Leela,Blek10496,Blek," Leela really bringing in the customers.
",41,48,3,16,Director #1 #2,Cygnoid Woman #110497,Cygnoid Woman #1," This keep up, we need to buy second sauce toilet.
",51,48,3,16,Blek,Girl10498,Girl," When I grow up I want to injure men by throwing stuff at them just like you, Leela. Will you sign my magazine?
",112,48,3,16,Cygnoid Woman #1,Leela10499,Leela," Aw! Sure thing, sweetie. Who should I make it out to?
",55,48,3,16,Girl,Girl10500,Girl," Well, uh ... to eBay?
",23,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10501,Leela," That's a popular name today. Little ""e"" big ""B""?
",50,48,3,16,Girl,Bender10502,Bender," Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add a one and two zeros in front of that and we got ourselves a wad!
",105,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10503,Leela," I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm doing it for all the struggling female athletes who need a role model.
",108,48,3,16,Bender,Woman #110504,Woman #1," Yeah! A role model for how to stink!
",38,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10505,Leela," What? Who are you?
",20,48,3,16,Woman #1,Woman #110506,Woman #1," Jackie Anderson. I'm on the blernsball team at NNYU and I was hoping to get to play in the majors soon.
",105,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10507,Leela," Oh, following in my footsteps?
",32,48,3,16,Woman #1,Jackie10508,Jackie," Pft. God forbid! Your little freakshow is making it impossible for real female ball players to be taken seriously. I hope you're proud of yourself.
",149,48,3,16,Leela,Bender10509,Bender," Alright, show's over. No refunds. You heard the robot. Get out!
",65,48,3,16,Jackie,Leela10510,Leela," I'm a fool. The fans haven't been cheering for me, they've been cheering at me.
",81,48,3,16,Bender,Amy10511,Amy," Don't be upset, Leela. You, um ... you look really cute in your uniform.
",74,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10512,Leela,"  That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic.
",71,48,3,16,Amy,Bender10513,Bender," You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You know the one I mean? The one who died?
",110,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10514,Leela," You're right. I can't let people down anymore. As God as my witness, I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere. I will become the best blernsball player of all time.
",181,48,3,16,Bender,Hermes10515,Hermes," That's statistically impossible. In 77 innings you haven't gotten a single out. At this rate, you're sure to go down as the worst blernsball player of all time.
",162,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10516,Leela," Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear that I will become not the worst blernsball player of all time.
",109,48,3,16,Hermes,Fry10517,Fry," Hey, look! The players who broke the various colour barriers.
",63,48,3,16,Leela,Bender10518,Bender," When will Man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?
",68,48,3,16,Fry,Leela10519,Leela," Ah, here we are. The worst player in history. If I can be just a little better than him I can slink away with my head held high.
",130,48,3,16,Bender,Bender10520,Bender," It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat.
",80,48,3,16,Leela,Fry10521,Fry," And here he is trying to make a catch with an oven mitt.
",58,48,3,16,Bender,Leela10522,Leela," It's even a crummy hologram.
",30,48,3,16,Fry,Aaron Jr.10523,Aaron Jr.," I'm not a hologram, though I am crummy.  Hank Aaron XXIV.
",59,48,3,16,Leela,Fry10524,Fry," Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!
",86,48,3,16,Aaron Jr.,Aaron Sr.10525,Aaron Sr.," No, I was better than great. I was the home run king!
",55,48,3,16,Fry,Bender10526,Bender," Neat!
",7,48,3,16,Aaron Sr.,Leela10527,Leela," So, Hank-- The bad Hank. Just how blowful were you?
",53,48,3,16,Bender,Aaron Jr.10528,Aaron Jr.," Well, I had a low batting average.
",36,48,3,16,Leela,Aaron Sr.10529,Aaron Sr.," Low? It was zero, you fungo! You went your whole career without getting a hit.
",80,48,3,16,Aaron Jr.,Fry10530,Fry," Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting an out.
",79,48,3,16,Aaron Sr.,Aaron Sr.10531,Aaron Sr.," You stink, lady! Hey, Junior, she belongs in the exhibit instead of you.
",74,48,3,16,Fry,Aaron Jr.10532,Aaron Jr.," Forget it. This job's too cushy to give up.  Ah, Wade Boggs! Goes down smooth!
",80,48,3,16,Aaron Sr.,Leela10533,Leela," Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. That's why I need your help. So I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you.
",120,48,3,16,Aaron Jr.,Aaron Jr.10534,Aaron Jr.," Oh, I can't help you play better than Tiny Iota. That guy was great. But I'll teach you everything I know.
",108,48,3,16,Leela,Aaron Jr.10535,Aaron Jr.," OK, let's see what you can do.
",32,48,3,16,Aaron Jr.,Bender10536,Bender," One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better get a batting helmet.
",106,48,3,16,Aaron Jr.,Leela10537,Leela,"  Alright. Low and away.
",25,48,3,16,Bender,Aaron Jr.10538,Aaron Jr.," OK, try it again. But this time keep your eye off the ball.
",61,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10539,Leela," You mean ""keep your eye on the ball""?
",39,48,3,16,Aaron Jr.,Aaron Jr.10540,Aaron Jr.," Hey, lady, which one of us is in the hall of fame?
",52,48,3,16,Leela,Fry10541,Fry,"  Pst. You're holding the bat upside down.
",43,48,3,16,Aaron Jr.,Aaron Jr.10542,Aaron Jr.," Just pitch the ball.
",22,48,3,16,Fry,Leela10543,Leela," OK. Eye off the ball.
",23,48,3,16,Aaron Jr.,Bender10544,Bender," Strike!
",9,48,3,16,Leela,Fry10545,Fry," Hooray!
",9,48,3,16,Bender,Aaron Jr.10546,Aaron Jr.," You did it, Leela!
",20,48,3,16,Fry,Leela10547,Leela," I didn't hit the batter! For once I was pitching and not just belly-itching!
",78,48,3,16,Aaron Jr.,Aaron Jr.10548,Aaron Jr.," Oh, you got that too? I think there's a rash goin' around.
",60,48,3,16,Leela,Uecker10549,Uecker," Welcome to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Poindexters, where the Mets close out a season that'll rank among Mankind's most awful crimes.
",139,48,3,16,Aaron Jr.,Fry10550,Fry," Hey! You opened a franchise!
",30,48,3,16,Uecker,Cygnoid Woman #110551,Cygnoid Woman #1," Yes. Our biggest seller is Leela's Bean Pizza. Six kinds of beans, plus several things that look like beans.
",110,48,3,16,Fry,Gilman10552,Gilman," Beans, huh? Mmm. This is great! How to you make the crust so fizzy?
",69,48,3,16,Cygnoid Woman #1,Blek10553,Blek," Ah-ah-ah! Ancient Cygnoid secret!
",35,48,3,16,Gilman,Cygnoid Woman #110554,Cygnoid Woman #1," My husband, some hotshot! Here's his ancient Cygnoid secret!  Live hornets! We smush them right into dough!
",109,48,3,16,Blek,Gilman10555,Gilman," I don't care if there's horse manure in it!
",45,48,3,16,Cygnoid Woman #1,Blek10556,Blek," That's a-good!
",16,48,3,16,Gilman,Gilman10557,Gilman," I wanna buy this franchise. How does $100,000 sound?
",54,48,3,16,Blek,Blek10558,Blek," Forget it! We come to Earth to make pizza, not money.
",55,48,3,16,Gilman,Cygnoid Woman #110559,Cygnoid Woman #1," No, Blek! Other way around!
",29,48,3,16,Blek,Blek10560,Blek," Oh, right. Offer accepted!
",28,48,3,16,Cygnoid Woman #1,Uecker10561,Uecker," Well, fans, Boston's turning the last game into a real ""squeeeker""! And that's with three ""e's""! Two men on and they're down to their last out.
",145,48,3,16,Blek,Leela10562,Leela," Come on, skipper. It's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player ever. Please put me in.
",97,48,3,16,Uecker,Skipper10563,Skipper," No. We're actually winning this game. You only go in as a joke when we're eight runs behind. Or when our other pitchers sneak out early to beat the traffic.   Come on! Let's see some fundamentals out there!  And not clown fundamentals.  Aw, darn, darn darn! Now the bases are loaded! Isn't there a man on this team who can get one more out?
",342,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10564,Leela," I can.
",8,48,3,16,Skipper,Skipper10565,Skipper," I repeat: Isn't there a man on this team on this--
",52,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10566,Leela," I've been training with Hank Aaron.
",37,48,3,16,Skipper,Skipper10567,Skipper," You've been training with the Hank Aaron?
",43,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10568,Leela," I've been training with a Hank Aaron.
",39,48,3,16,Skipper,Skipper10569,Skipper," Alright then. Get in there and pitch like you've never pitched like you before!
",81,48,3,16,Leela,Announcer #110570,Announcer #1,"  Now pitching for the Mets: Turanga Leela.
",44,48,3,16,Skipper,Crowd10571,Crowd,"  Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean!  Go, Leela!
",44,48,3,16,Announcer #1,Farnsworth10572,Farnsworth,"  Go, Leela!
",13,48,3,16,Crowd,Amy10573,Amy,"  Come on, Leela!
",18,48,3,16,Farnsworth,Bender10574,Bender,"  Put it right down the pike!
",30,48,3,16,Amy,Fry10575,Fry,"  Strike him out, Leela! Do it for the hundreds of women everywhere!
",69,48,3,16,Bender,Announcer #110576,Announcer #1,"  Your attention: Now pinch-hitting for the Poindexters: Jackie Anderson.
",74,48,3,16,Fry,Uecker10577,Uecker," Would you look at that! College blernsball's finest female hitter making her big league debut against pro-ball's worst female anything. I've never seen anything this bizarre, and I've seen Mr. Belvedere naked! Woo!
",216,48,3,16,Announcer #1,Leela10578,Leela,"  Keep cool. She's just like any other player. She puts on her sports bra one arm at a time.
",93,48,3,16,Uecker,Umpire10579,Umpire," Strike one!
",13,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10580,Leela," Strike one, a personal best!
",30,48,3,16,Umpire,Umpire10581,Umpire," Strike two!
",13,48,3,16,Leela,Uecker10582,Uecker,"  Remember, fans, this exciting moment is brought to you by Month Old Franks, the hotdogs with experience! Mmm-mmm!  A grand slam blern. The Mets lose! Their season is over! And no question, Leela, the first woman ever to reach the Majors, will go down as the single worst player in the history of blernsball!  And yet tonight we have witnessed the beginning of a great career for the first woman to play the sport well -- Jackie Anderson!
",440,48,3,16,Umpire,Jackie10583,Jackie," Leela?
",8,48,3,16,Uecker,Leela10584,Leela," Jackie. I guess you were right. I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry.
",68,48,3,16,Jackie,Jackie10585,Jackie," No, don't be. It turns out you were an inspiration after all.
",63,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10586,Leela,"  I was?
",9,48,3,16,Jackie,Jackie10587,Jackie," Uh-huh. You were so awful that women everywhere set out to prove they don't stink as bad as you. You know, like a pig or something.
",133,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10588,Leela," Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference after all.
",67,48,3,16,Jackie,Jackie10589,Jackie," You absolutely did, Leela. Now please, please retire. Immediately.
",68,48,3,16,Leela,Leela10590,Leela," Hey, kid. Catch!
",18,48,3,16,Jackie,Aaron Sr.10591,Aaron Sr.," Well, at least you're still the worst football player of all time.
",68,48,3,16,Leela,Aaron Jr.10592,Aaron Jr.," Yeah. Yeah.
",13,48,3,16,Aaron Sr.,Linda10593,Linda,"  Up next, daring daylight robbery at a municipal swimming pool.
",65,49,3,17,Aaron Jr.,Bender10594,Bender," Ooh! This is it! Turn me up!
",30,49,3,17,Linda,Linda10595,Linda,"  Earlier today, a foul-mouthed bandit robbed the municipal pool, making off with the contents of over three lockers.
",118,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10596,Bender," More like three lockers and a sink!
",37,49,3,17,Linda,Leela10597,Leela," Bender? Did you have something to do with this?
",49,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10598,Bender," Of course not.
",16,49,3,17,Leela,Hermes10599,Hermes," Holy spitz! He's sportin' skintight Speedos!
",46,49,3,17,Bender,Amy10600,Amy," They don't leave much to the imagination.
",43,49,3,17,Hermes,Hermes10601,Hermes," Actually, on a robot, they sorta do.
",38,49,3,17,Amy,Morbo10602,Morbo,"  One puny human got a look at the robber...
",45,49,3,17,Hermes,Bender10603,Bender," Here we go. Here we go!
",25,49,3,17,Morbo,Morbo10604,Morbo,"  Describing him as a short, nasty, muscular...
",48,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10605,Bender," Yeah, make me famous, big head!
",33,49,3,17,Morbo,Morbo10606,Morbo,"  Caucasian human male.
",24,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10607,Bender," What?
",7,49,3,17,Morbo,Fry10608,Fry," Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch and drink all day?
",57,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10609,Bender," This is an outrage. What's the point of pulling the biggest pool caper ever if nobody knows you did it?
",105,49,3,17,Fry,Fry10610,Fry," Well, there's the material rewards.
",37,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10611,Bender," You mean this junk? 
",22,49,3,17,Fry,Boy10612,Boy," Whee!
",7,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10613,Bender,"  All I ever wanted was for people to remember my name.  It's Bender.
",70,49,3,17,Boy,Farnsworth10614,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff! Why bother remembering anything? You're just going to forget it five seconds later.
",95,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10615,Bender,"  It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty in-your-face outlook doomed to obscurity like the rest of you, especially Leela. If I died tomorrow, no one would even notice.
",175,49,3,17,Farnsworth,Scruffy10616,Scruffy," Boy, I've never seen him so down, or ever before.
",51,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10617,Bender," How does a nobody like me get famous?  I know!  Hey, look! I'm stuck! But I haven't given up hope! Call a soft-news journalist!
",129,49,3,17,Scruffy,Woman #110618,Woman #1," You're not stuck.
",19,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10619,Bender,"  Shut up.
",11,49,3,17,Woman #1,Bender10620,Bender," Hey, everyone do The Bender! This move's called The Bender!
",61,49,3,17,Bender,Roller-Skater10621,Roller-Skater," Yo, hotwheels. This circle's about free expression, not fascist moves!
",72,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10622,Bender," A blank wall! Fame is mine!
",29,49,3,17,Roller-Skater,Bender10623,Bender," There. Now no one will forget how I lived or my attitude regarding butt.
",74,49,3,17,Bender,Sal10624,Sal," Alrights, ladies, let's flush these artists lofts straights to hell!
",70,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10625,Bender,"  No!
",6,49,3,17,Sal,Bender10626,Bender," I'm the first one to work. A new low.
",39,49,3,17,Bender,All10627,All," Surprise!
",11,49,3,17,Bender,Fry10628,Fry," Happy funeral, Bender!
",24,49,3,17,All,Bender10629,Bender," A surprise funeral? For me?
",29,49,3,17,Fry,Fry10630,Fry," We just wanted to show you that you really will be remembered.
",64,49,3,17,Bender,Zoidberg10631,Zoidberg,"  Now if the deceased would kindly take his place of honour.
",61,49,3,17,Fry,Bender10632,Bender," Ooh! Cushion-y! And a minibar!
",32,49,3,17,Zoidberg,Fry10633,Fry," Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life when he was crushed by a runaway semi driven by the Incredible Hulk.
",159,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10634,Bender," Aw! You knew my favourite cause of death.
",43,49,3,17,Fry,Fry10635,Fry," Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way. Professor?
",82,49,3,17,Bender,Farnsworth10636,Farnsworth," Your standard bending unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different. Bender had a point-04% nickel impurity.
",127,49,3,17,Fry,Bender10637,Bender,"  It's what made me me.
",24,49,3,17,Farnsworth,Hermes10638,Hermes," If you ever needed a small package brought into the country without a lot of X-raying and such, Bender always had a free body cavity.
",135,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10639,Bender," Eh, the Professor's was better.
",33,49,3,17,Hermes,Leela10640,Leela," Bender, shush. You're supposed to be dead.
",44,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10641,Bender," Say more about how great I am. And where's the crying? You people look like you're waiting for the bus.
",105,49,3,17,Leela,Zoidberg10642,Zoidberg,"  Oh, Danny-boy,
The pipes, the pipes are calling--
",52,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10643,Bender," Who-y-boy?
",12,49,3,17,Zoidberg,Zoidberg10644,Zoidberg,"  From glen to glen and down--
",31,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10645,Bender," Danny-boy? You're at my funeral, singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy? You really are a massive bonehead.
",116,49,3,17,Zoidberg,Zoidberg10646,Zoidberg," I'm expressing my sorrow.
",27,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10647,Bender," Get lost! I'd say ""Don't quit your day job"" but you're awful at that too.
",75,49,3,17,Zoidberg,Leela10648,Leela," We're trying our best.
",24,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10649,Bender," Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it up, people. So far it's been crap after crap! I croaked, now show me some love!
",118,49,3,17,Leela,Amy10650,Amy," Bender was a truly special--
",30,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10651,Bender,"  Louder and sadder.
",21,49,3,17,Amy,Amy10652,Amy,"  Bender was a truly special--
",31,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10653,Bender,"  Next!
",8,49,3,17,Amy,Preacherbot10654,Preacherbot," Dear Lord--
",13,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10655,Bender,"  Oh, next!
",12,49,3,17,Preacherbot,Zoidberg10656,Zoidberg,"  Oh, Danny-boy--
",18,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10657,Bender," Come on! Surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was.
",71,49,3,17,Zoidberg,Fry10658,Fry," Yes there is, Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people. But, looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this: Bender was my friend.
",178,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10659,Bender," What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever!  I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living, by showing how bad my funeral will suck.
",201,49,3,17,Fry,Amy10660,Amy," I know whose funeral we'll be attending next!
",47,49,3,17,Bender,Farnsworth10661,Farnsworth,"  Oh, stop!
",12,49,3,17,Amy,Farnsworth10662,Farnsworth," News, everyone! Today you're going to Osiris 4 to deliver this enormous sandstone block.
",90,49,3,17,Farnsworth,Fry10663,Fry," I thought something looked different in here.
",47,49,3,17,Farnsworth,Fry10664,Fry," Hi. We have a giant stone to deliver. Sign here.
",50,49,3,17,Fry,Osiran10665,Osiran," Ah, very nice. Much like the 10 million identical stones used in the future tomb of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip.
",117,49,3,17,Fry,Leela10666,Leela," Impressive. Who's building it?
",32,49,3,17,Osiran,Osiran10667,Osiran," You.
",6,49,3,17,Leela,Leela10668,Leela," Say again?
",12,49,3,17,Osiran,Osiran10669,Osiran," You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards.
",63,49,3,17,Leela,Fry10670,Fry," Call it a hunch but I've got a bad feeling about this.
",56,49,3,17,Osiran,Fry10671,Fry," You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but they don't pay you or let you go.
",104,49,3,17,Fry,Leela10672,Leela," That's the only thing about being a slave!
",44,49,3,17,Fry,Osiran10673,Osiran," Attention. You are now possessions of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip, heir to the Tenth Dynasty, bringer of the good aspects of the annual floods.
",148,49,3,17,Leela,Fry10674,Fry," Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day.
",66,49,3,17,Osiran,Osiran10675,Osiran," That is no coincidence. For our people visited your Egypt thousands of years ago.
",83,49,3,17,Fry,Fry10676,Fry," I knew it! Insane theories, one; regular theories, a billion.
",63,49,3,17,Osiran,Osiran10677,Osiran," We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians, such as pyramid-building, space travel and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello.
",154,49,3,17,Fry,Fry10678,Fry," Also Wolfman!
",15,49,3,17,Osiran,Bender10679,Bender," Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die.
",66,49,3,17,Fry,Leela10680,Leela," Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments.
",89,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10681,Bender," Hey, you spend your whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna remember him.  I think I'm gonna like it here!
",117,49,3,17,Leela,Man #110682,Man #1," Yeah, I, uh, noticed your sign and I thought I'd come over here and look into getting involved in your program.
",113,49,3,17,Bender,Man #1 #210683,Man #1 #2," What we do is make you starve to death.
",41,49,3,17,Man #1,Osiran10684,Osiran," One, two, three, pull!  One, two, three, pull!
",48,49,3,17,Man #1 #2,Australian Man #110685,Australian Man #1," Oh! Bloody chunder!
",21,49,3,17,Osiran,Bender10686,Bender," Pick it up, people. We're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one-half?
",158,49,3,17,Australian Man #1,Osiran10687,Osiran," Good idea, slave.  One-half, pull!  One-half, pull!
",53,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10688,Bender," Now we're slavin'!
",20,49,3,17,Osiran,Bender10689,Bender," Come on, guys. Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this.  You call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like this.
",171,49,3,17,Bender,Leela10690,Leela," Bender, quit giving the slave drivers pointers!
",49,49,3,17,Bender,Fry10691,Fry," Yeah. Remember who your real friends are.
",43,49,3,17,Leela,Bender10692,Bender," I'll tell you who I remember.  Anopsis ... Pleotut ... Whatshisname. He was the greatest of all.
",98,49,3,17,Fry,Osiran10693,Osiran," Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches.
",34,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10694,Bender," Hurry! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get that nose in place. Come on!
",66,49,3,17,Osiran,Hermenthotip10695,Hermenthotip," Excellent work! I am very proud of all you slaves.
",52,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10696,Bender," Viva Hermenthotip!
",20,49,3,17,Hermenthotip,Hermenthotip10697,Hermenthotip," And now, I have a grand announcement. In honour of your achievement, you're all hereby--
",90,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10698,Bender,"  No!
",6,49,3,17,Hermenthotip,Hermenthotip10699,Hermenthotip,"  Tell the slaves they can all go--
",36,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10700,Bender," Go faster? I told them but they're so damn lazy.
",50,49,3,17,Hermenthotip,Hermenthotip10701,Hermenthotip,"  No. I mean they are all free--
",33,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10702,Bender," Free-loading off you? I agree.
",32,49,3,17,Hermenthotip,Hermenthotip10703,Hermenthotip,"  No, I--
",10,49,3,17,Bender,Osiran10704,Osiran," Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead.
",31,49,3,17,Hermenthotip,Bender10705,Bender,"  He's whippin' angels now.
",28,49,3,17,Osiran,High Priest10706,High Priest," We commend the body of Hermenthotip to the abode of the damned. The damned good looking!  Pharaoh commanded me to tell that joke at his funeral.
",146,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10707,Bender,"  I'll always remember you, Hermenthotip!
",42,49,3,17,High Priest,High Priest10708,High Priest," To equip Pharaoh for his journey, we bury him with his favourite possessions. Such as his heart and liver.  And the many goods he left in his royal garage.  Also, this bag of cats our culture considers holy.
",209,49,3,17,Bender,Singer10709,Singer,"  Pharaoh my God-king,
You are cold and deceased,
I used to have him sing...
",77,49,3,17,High Priest,Singer10710,Singer," P-P-P-Pharaoh and his pets...
",31,49,3,17,Singer,Singer10711,Singer," But the years went by,
And Pharaoh died,
Suzie will have joined him in the afterlife--
",88,49,3,17,Singer,Osiran10712,Osiran," Hermenthotip is gone. The time to designate a new Pharaoh is at hand.
",71,49,3,17,Singer,Bender10713,Bender," Wow!
",6,49,3,17,Osiran,Osiran10714,Osiran," At dawn tomorrow, the high priest will consult the Wall of Prophecy to determine Hermenthotip's successor.  That concludes the funeral. You don't have to go home but you can't stay here.
",188,49,3,17,Bender,Fry10715,Fry," Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!
",37,49,3,17,Osiran,Slave #110716,Slave #1," Yes! Tonight we are slaves to no one, except the rhythm!
",58,49,3,17,Fry,Leela10717,Leela," Yeah! Play those bongos!
",26,49,3,17,Slave #1,Fry10718,Fry," I'm gonna spin till I fall down!
",34,49,3,17,Leela,Bender10719,Bender," We interrupt this ancient prophecy to bring you late-breaking bulletin. He hammers the back of his head and creates and imprint of himself on the wall.
",153,49,3,17,Fry,High Priest10720,High Priest," Great Wall of Prophecy, reveal to us God's will that we may blindly obey.
",75,49,3,17,Bender,Priests10721,Priests,"  Free us from thought and responsibility.
",43,49,3,17,High Priest,High Priest10722,High Priest," We shall read things off you.
",31,49,3,17,Priests,Priests10723,Priests,"  Then do them.
",16,49,3,17,High Priest,High Priest10724,High Priest," Your words guide us.
",22,49,3,17,Priests,Priests10725,Priests,"  We're dumb.
",14,49,3,17,High Priest,Fry10726,Fry," You know what else stinks about being a slave? The hours.
",59,49,3,17,Priests,High Priest10727,High Priest," The prophecy is strange and crudely drawn at best. It indicates that, we are ""here"" and our next Pharaoh is over there, near some ... tents.
",142,49,3,17,Fry,Bender10728,Bender,"  Those are waves, jackass. It's supposed to be a river!
",57,49,3,17,High Priest,Fry10729,Fry," Hey. I think I know who the next Pharaoh is!
",46,49,3,17,Bender,Leela10730,Leela," Oh, Lord!
",11,49,3,17,Fry,High Priest10731,High Priest," We hear your voice, oh, great Pharaoh. Reveal yourself to us.
",63,49,3,17,Leela,Bender10732,Bender," Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies!
",62,49,3,17,High Priest,High Priest10733,High Priest," It is he. Just as the Wall of Prophecy prophesied.  Long live Pharaoh Bender!
",79,49,3,17,Bender,Slaves10734,Slaves,"  Long live Pharaoh Bender!
",28,49,3,17,High Priest,Leela10735,Leela," This society is a bunch of idiots.
",36,49,3,17,Slaves,High Priest10736,High Priest," People of Osiris 4, please welcome a man who started as a slave but worked his way up to Lord of All Creation! Our new Pharaoh, Bender!
",137,49,3,17,Leela,Bender10737,Bender," Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past.  Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.
",131,49,3,17,High Priest,Leela10738,Leela," What did he say?
",18,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10739,Bender," Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion. One billion cubits in height ...  ... that I might be remember-ed for all eternity. And be quick about it!
",183,49,3,17,Leela,Bender10740,Bender," Lowly slave, why are you not working?
",39,49,3,17,Bender,Slave #210741,Slave #2," I am.
",7,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10742,Bender," I meant yourself to death.
",28,49,3,17,Slave #2,Slave #310743,Slave #3," Mighty Pharaoh, it hurts when I breathe.
",42,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10744,Bender," Well then what do you think you should stop doing?  Crawl, pigs!
",66,49,3,17,Slave #3,Leela10745,Leela," Ow!

",25,49,3,17,Leela,Bender10747,Bender," Your task is nearly completed. Don't let down Pharaoh now.
",60,49,3,17,Bender,Osiran10748,Osiran," The great monument is finished, oh Pharaoh. And now, the unveiling.
",69,49,3,17,Bender,Statue10749,Statue," Remember me.  Remember me.  Remember me.
",42,49,3,17,Osiran,Osiran10750,Osiran," Does it please you, my lord?
",30,49,3,17,Statue,Bender10751,Bender," Hmm ... it's a good start. Uh, yeah, it's definitely big alright. I just wonder if it's too big, y'know? I mean, are people gonna be remembering me or the statue?
",164,49,3,17,Osiran,High Priest10752,High Priest," But, sire, we made it to your exact specifications.
",53,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10753,Bender," Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down and try again. But this time don't embarrass yourselves.
",96,49,3,17,High Priest,High Priest10754,High Priest," Ladies and gentlemen, the Pharaoh suddenly died.
",50,49,3,17,Bender,Leela10755,Leela," Good riddance.
",16,49,3,17,High Priest,Bender10756,Bender,"  What about my servants?
",26,49,3,17,Leela,Priest10757,Priest," Oh, yeah.
",11,49,3,17,Bender,Fry10758,Fry," Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause if it isn't ... we're in trouble!
",76,49,3,17,Priest,Leela10759,Leela," You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us along?
",44,49,3,17,Fry,Bender10760,Bender," I wanted to watch you remember me.
",36,49,3,17,Leela,Leela10761,Leela," Did you really think you'd need all this junk in the afterlife?
",65,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10762,Bender," Afterlife? Pft. If I thought I had to go through a whole other life I'd kill myself right now.
",96,49,3,17,Leela,Leela10763,Leela," Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving.
",43,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10764,Bender," Sorry, but we're totally sealed in.  Nothing can get in or out. Except millions of snakes.  Here, have a pomegranate schnapps from my private distillery and start sharing fond memories of me, Bender.
",201,49,3,17,Leela,Fry10765,Fry," What proof is this? Some huge number?
",39,49,3,17,Bender,Leela10766,Leela," It's explosive! Maybe we could escape by setting fire to the distillery and blowing this whole place to rubble!  Let's get a little kindling going!
",149,49,3,17,Fry,Bender10767,Bender," No! You can't blow up my monument. I won't be remembered.
",59,49,3,17,Leela,Leela10768,Leela," Oh, right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey, Fry? Remember that robot ""Bender""?
",101,49,3,17,Bender,Fry10769,Fry," Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell.  Did you hear something, Leela?
",63,49,3,17,Leela,Leela10770,Leela," No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing.
",59,49,3,17,Fry,Bender10771,Bender," Stop it, stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line.
",58,49,3,17,Leela,Fry10772,Fry," Hey, Leela, you know who I remember?
",38,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10773,Bender," Oh, please, let it be me.
",27,49,3,17,Fry,Fry10774,Fry," That guy who used to bend things. You know?
",45,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10775,Bender," Me, please!
",13,49,3,17,Fry,Fry10776,Fry," Hermes.
",9,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10777,Bender," Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, blow up my statue.
",68,49,3,17,Fry,Leela10778,Leela," Oh, Bender! When did you come in? Hold still!
",47,49,3,17,Bender,Leela10779,Leela," Let's blow this tomb!
",23,49,3,17,Leela,Slave #110780,Slave #1," Pharaoh Bender! He once more walks among the living.
",54,49,3,17,Leela,Bender10781,Bender,"  How we doing?
",16,49,3,17,Slave #1,Statue10782,Statue," Remember me.
",14,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10783,Bender,"  I will. I will.
",18,49,3,17,Statue,Bender10784,Bender," Please, just leave me alone.
",30,49,3,17,Bender,Leela10785,Leela," Bender, I understand your desire to be remembered. But you don't need a statue for that.
",90,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10786,Bender,"  I don't?
",11,49,3,17,Leela,Leela10787,Leela," No. You have your legacy as a brutal, tyrannical dictator, and that will outlive any monument.
",96,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10788,Bender," You really think they'll remember me?
",39,49,3,17,Leela,Fry10789,Fry," Absolutely.
",13,49,3,17,Bender,Bender10790,Bender," Well in that case. One planet down! Helmsman...
",49,49,3,17,Fry,Bender10791,Bender,"  Set course for Earth!
",24,49,3,17,Bender,Leela10792,Leela,"  That's not Earth.

",145,50,3,18,Raiders of the Lost Arcade,Leela10796,Leela," That's so plausible I can't believe it!
",41,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10797,Farnsworth," Who wants the machine to show them an alternate reality?
",58,50,3,18,Leela,Bender10798,Bender," Ooh! Ooh! I wanna know what would happen if I were human. I mean, being a robot's great, but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad.
",155,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10799,Farnsworth," Oh, Lordy Lou, there he goes again. Well, let's give baby what he wants.  What if Bender were human?
",102,50,3,18,Bender,Farnsworth10800,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I've invented a way to turn Bender into a human using a process I call ""reverse fossilisation"".
",118,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Leela10801,Leela," How does it work?
",19,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10802,Farnsworth," Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realising that, it was a simple matter to reverse the process. I've already tested it by turning the toaster into a racoon.
",190,50,3,18,Leela,Fry10803,Fry," Kinda game-y.
",15,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10804,Farnsworth," Are you ready, Bender?
",24,50,3,18,Fry,Bender10805,Bender," I dunno. I'm beginning to have some second thoughts--
",55,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Hermes10806,Hermes," Cover your shame, mon!
",24,50,3,18,Bender,Farnsworth10807,Farnsworth," It worked! Eat it, everyone whose never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you, Amy!
",88,50,3,18,Hermes,Bender10808,Bender," So this is a human body, huh? Neat!  Hey, my antenna's gone.  No, it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little.
",165,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Fry10809,Fry,"  Bender, no! You'll make God cry.
",35,50,3,18,Bender,Bender10810,Bender," Well, let's see what kinda things this body can do.  Hey, that's pretty fun.  Being human is great!
",101,50,3,18,Fry,Zoidberg10811,Zoidberg," Hooray! It's just like Mardis Gras!
",37,50,3,18,Bender,Bender10812,Bender," Guy! Guys! You've gotta see this. You're not gonna believe it!
",64,50,3,18,Zoidberg,Leela10813,Leela," Bender, it's OK to be proud but don't be a show-off.
",54,50,3,18,Bender,Bender10814,Bender," Whoa! You look a lot better than you used to for some reason.
",63,50,3,18,Leela,Amy10815,Amy,"  You're not so bad yourself, big boy.
",39,50,3,18,Bender,Bender10816,Bender," Hey, that felt great!  Nah, it's not working anymore.
",55,50,3,18,Amy,Farnsworth10817,Farnsworth," Speak for yourself!
",21,50,3,18,Bender,Bender10818,Bender," Whoa! This is awesome!
",24,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Leela10819,Leela," Bender, you drank and smoked when you were a robot.
",53,50,3,18,Bender,Bender10820,Bender," But now it's bad for me!
",26,50,3,18,Leela,Fry10821,Fry," Speaking of which, try these nachos.
",38,50,3,18,Bender,Bender10822,Bender," Mmm! Why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good?  What's going on? That rhythm! It's doing something to my human butt.
",133,50,3,18,Fry,Amy10823,Amy," Bender, part of being human is having self control.
",53,50,3,18,Bender,Bender10824,Bender," Oh, my God! I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time!
",77,50,3,18,Amy,Amy10825,Amy," No, Bender!
",13,50,3,18,Bender,Hermes10826,Hermes," No!
",5,50,3,18,Amy,Leela10827,Leela," Stop him.
",11,50,3,18,Hermes,Bender10828,Bender," Let me go.
",12,50,3,18,Leela,Leela10829,Leela," No!
",5,50,3,18,Bender,Farnsworth10830,Farnsworth," Come, Bender. It's time to go home and rest. I need you in top shape next week when I present you to the Nobel Prize Committee. Bender?
",137,50,3,18,Leela,Bender10831,Bender,"  Goodbye, moderation!
",23,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Zoidberg10832,Zoidberg," Is Bender still missing for a week? Where is he, already?
",59,50,3,18,Bender,Farnsworth10833,Farnsworth," Uh, as I've said before, I used reverse fossilisation, which is the reverse of regular, um...
",95,50,3,18,Zoidberg,Fry10834,Fry,"  Pst! We found him!
",21,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10835,Farnsworth," Ah! Then without further stalling for time, I present to the Nobel judges the first robot ever turned into a human.
",117,50,3,18,Fry,Wernstrom10836,Wernstrom," My God! He needs medical attention!
",37,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Zoidberg10837,Zoidberg," Pulse, 300; liver, failing; cholesterol, 40?
",46,50,3,18,Wernstrom,Leela10838,Leela," Well, that's not so bad.
",26,50,3,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg10839,Zoidberg," No, I mean 40 pounds!
",23,50,3,18,Leela,Farnsworth10840,Farnsworth," This, um, scientific breakthrough ... heralds a new dawn in human-robot relations, yes.
",89,50,3,18,Zoidberg,Bender10841,Bender," C'mere and give old Bender a kiss.  Hey, you like grilled cheese?
",67,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10842,Farnsworth," And, um, that's why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize.
",58,50,3,18,Bender,Wernstrom10843,Wernstrom," Not only do you not deserve a Nobel Prize for loosing this bloated man-ball on the world but you are hereby kicked out of the Academy of Science.
",147,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Bender10844,Bender," Wait! As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves.
",138,50,3,18,Wernstrom,Wernstrom10845,Wernstrom," Young man, you have opened our minds and swayed our hearts. Let us therefore--
",80,50,3,18,Bender,Bender10846,Bender,"  Party!
",9,50,3,18,Wernstrom,Wernstrom10847,Wernstrom," Bender, you were right! Truly you have lived more in your one week of being human than the rest of us have in our entire lives.
",129,50,3,18,Bender,Bender10848,Bender," Woo!
",6,50,3,18,Wernstrom,Wernstrom10849,Wernstrom," And so, to recognise your achievements, I hereby award you the Nobel Prize ...  ... in, uh ...  ... Chemistry.
",112,50,3,18,Bender,Farnsworth10850,Farnsworth," Care to say a few words, Bender?
",34,50,3,18,Wernstrom,Fry10851,Fry," He's dead.
",12,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Wernstrom10852,Wernstrom," When did he die?
",18,50,3,18,Fry,Farnsworth10853,Farnsworth," About 12 hours ago when the party started.
",44,50,3,18,Wernstrom,Wernstrom10854,Wernstrom," But he just said, ""Woo.""
",26,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10855,Farnsworth," No, that was air escaping from the folds of his fat.  Goodnight, sweet prince. You were the greatest man any of us will ever know. Well, let's get him out of here. He's starting to smell up the joint.
",202,50,3,18,Wernstrom,Narrator10856,Narrator,"  You watched it, you can't un-watch it. Stay tuned for more Tales of Interest!
",80,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10857,Farnsworth," Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanthor?
",77,50,3,18,Narrator,Fry10858,Fry," Ooh, I have one. I'm good at video games and bad at everything else. That's why I wish life were more like a video game.
",122,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10859,Farnsworth," Can you put that in the form of a question?
",45,50,3,18,Fry,Fry10860,Fry," Uh, what if that thing I said?
",32,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10861,Farnsworth," Oh, great machine, we beseech thee. What if life were more like a video game?
",79,50,3,18,Fry,Nixon10862,Nixon,"  Good evening, ignorant pigs. Put down your crack pipes and your beer bongs and pay attention as I sign an historic peace accord with Ambassador Kong of planet Nintendu 64.
",174,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Fry10863,Fry," Wait a second! I know that monkey. His name is Donkey.
",56,50,3,18,Nixon,Farnsworth10864,Farnsworth," Monkeys aren't donkeys! Quit messing with my head!
",52,50,3,18,Fry,Nixon10865,Nixon," I'll just put the old ""John Q. Nixon"" on it.  There! No major crap-ups. You're on, Mr. Ambassador.  What the--
",112,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Mario10866,Mario," Mamma Mia! The cruel meatball of war has rolled onto our laps and ruined our white pants of peace!
",100,50,3,18,Nixon,Man #110867,Man #1," Mr. Fry, rumour has it you know the secrets of the video game Chance. Please step into the war room.

",101,50,3,18,Man #1,Fry10870,Fry," Well, sir, I spent all of ninth grade studying them, except for that day when my eyeballs started to bleed. And in my opinion--
",129,50,3,18,Pac-Man #1,Pac-Man #110871,Pac-Man #1," Quickly! To the escape tunnels!
",33,50,3,18,Fry,Pac-Man #110872,Pac-Man #1," This way, damnit!
",19,50,3,18,Pac-Man #1,Zoidberg10873,Zoidberg," Mmm, delicious! Just like stale marshmallows!  Ooh, and a cherry!

",52,50,3,18,Fry,Lrrr10895,Lrrr," You are defeated. Instead of shooting where I was, you should have shot at where I was going to be.

",31,50,3,18,Donkey Kong,Farnsworth10901,Farnsworth," Forget it, you pixilated pirates. We need those quarters to do our laundry.

",6,50,3,18,Lrrr,Amy10907,Amy," Go away! We're not giving you our quarters no matter what.
",60,50,3,18,Zoidberg,Lrrr10908,Lrrr," Well ... then what if we throw our laundry in with yours? Would that be acceptable?
",85,50,3,18,Amy,Fry10909,Fry," I guess so.
",13,50,3,18,Lrrr,Lrrr10910,Lrrr," OK, then. That settles that. But if this cape shrinks, consider your species extinct!
",87,50,3,18,Fry,Narrator10911,Narrator,"  Bravo! That'll be hard to top. I pity the next Tale of Interest.

",36,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Leela10914,Leela," OK.  As an alien who was abandoned on Earth, I've never really belonged anywhere.

",5,50,3,18,Bender,Bender10917,Bender," Uh ... where?
",15,50,3,18,Fry,Leela10918,Leela," So my question is this: What if I found my true home?  Ow!
",60,50,3,18,Bender,Leela10919,Leela," Where are we?
",15,50,3,18,Leela,Leela10920,Leela," Nibbler, I don't think we're in New New York anymore.  Jeez! Apparently the phrase ""tone it down"" doesn't exist on this planet.  Oh, no! We hit someone! Quick, back into the ship.  Ooh! Nice boots!
",199,50,3,18,Leela,Cubert10921,Cubert," Look, everyone! She killed the Man-Witch of the West!
",55,50,3,18,Leela,Leela10922,Leela," A witch? That explains how these boots magically appeared on my feet.

",52,50,3,18,Small Glurmo #1,Leela10927,Leela," Yeah... Can anyone fix my ship so I can get home?
",51,50,3,18,Amy,Amy10928,Amy," Abraca-duh! Just ask the Professor. He lives in the Emerald Laboratory down Martin Luther King Boulevard.
",107,50,3,18,Leela,Leela10929,Leela," You mean that yellow brick road?
",34,50,3,18,Amy,Amy10930,Amy," The city council renamed it in 1975.  Ooh! Those are great shoes!
",67,50,3,18,Leela,Leela10931,Leela," Oh, thank you.
",16,50,3,18,Amy,Amy10932,Amy," Do they come in women's sizes?
",32,50,3,18,Leela,Fry10933,Fry," OK, crow, prepare to be scared.   And then, ""honk, honk,"" the car honked its own horn!
",88,50,3,18,Amy,Leela10934,Leela," Wow! A talking scarecrow. Wanna come with us to see the Professor? He might be able to give you a brain.
",106,50,3,18,Fry,Fry10935,Fry," Hey! That's not a nice thing to say.
",38,50,3,18,Leela,Bender10936,Bender," Beer! Beer!
",13,50,3,18,Fry,Leela10937,Leela," Whiskey OK?
",13,50,3,18,Bender,Bender10938,Bender," Now did you say you were off to see the Professor? 'Cause I could use a heart -- a human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement.
",147,50,3,18,Leela,Zoidberg10939,Zoidberg," And I'm the other guy, courage. Not enough of it. Need some from whatshisname.
",80,50,3,18,Bender,Mom10940,Mom," Damn this DSL!  Fly, my stupids! Fly out and get them!
",56,50,3,18,Zoidberg,Igner10941,Igner," But, Mom, you promised you'd bake monkey cake today.
",54,50,3,18,Mom,Mom10942,Mom," By ""monkey cake"" I meant your ass!
",36,50,3,18,Igner,Fry10943,Fry," Man, we've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take the wiz.
",75,50,3,18,Mom,Zoidberg10944,Zoidberg," What, do I smell or something?
",32,50,3,18,Fry,Leela10945,Leela," Why did you bring us here?
",28,50,3,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg10946,Zoidberg," And why did I have to take a cab?
",35,50,3,18,Leela,Mom10947,Mom," I'll tell you why I brought you here, you twice-baked barf bags: Because I've always wanted a daughter to love. You want to get adopted, you little skank?
",156,50,3,18,Zoidberg,Leela10948,Leela," And live here? And be a witch like you? Yeah, alright. As long as I get to hurt people and not just dance around at the equinox.
",130,50,3,18,Mom,Mom10949,Mom," Absolutely.
",13,50,3,18,Leela,Leela10950,Leela," Oh, Mommy! I found my true home!
",34,50,3,18,Mom,Bender10951,Bender," Hooray!
",9,50,3,18,Leela,Zoidberg10952,Zoidberg," Alright!
",10,50,3,18,Bender,Fry10953,Fry," That's great, Leela.
",22,50,3,18,Zoidberg,Bender10954,Bender," I've heard worse excuses to drink.  Oops!
",43,50,3,18,Fry,Mom10955,Mom," I'm melting! Oh, who would have thought a small amount of liquid would ever fall on me?
",89,50,3,18,Bender,Bender10956,Bender," Well, no point letting her go to waste.
",41,50,3,18,Mom,Hermes10957,Hermes,"  Yes?
",7,50,3,18,Bender,Leela10958,Leela," We're here to see the Professor.
",34,50,3,18,Hermes,Hermes10959,Hermes,"  No one sees the mighty Professor.
",36,50,3,18,Leela,Farnsworth10960,Farnsworth,"  Who's there, Hermes? Is it visitors? I want to see them.
",59,50,3,18,Hermes,Hermes10961,Hermes,"  It's nobody. Now sign that will I gave you!  He's not here.
",62,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Leela10962,Leela," Oh, for the love of Benji!
",28,50,3,18,Hermes,Farnsworth10963,Farnsworth," I am the Professor, great and ... uh ... forgetful!  Now, what do you nice kids want?
",87,50,3,18,Leela,Zoidberg10964,Zoidberg," Nothing! I'm leaving. But if you have extra courage I'd haul it away for you, maybe?
",86,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10965,Farnsworth," Oh, blithery poop, my cowardly lobster! You don't need courage. After all, who needs courage when you have a gun?
",115,50,3,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg10966,Zoidberg," No, world, you put your hands up!
",35,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10967,Farnsworth," And you, lad, all you need is brain.
",38,50,3,18,Zoidberg,Fry10968,Fry," Why does everyone keep saying that?
",37,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Bender10969,Bender," This is a stick-up. Gimme the bag, old man!
",45,50,3,18,Fry,Farnsworth10970,Farnsworth," Here you go, my friend. 5000 Professor Land fun bucks.
",56,50,3,18,Bender,Bender10971,Bender," Oh, crap.
",11,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10972,Farnsworth," As for you, young lady, you want to go home, right?
",53,50,3,18,Bender,Leela10973,Leela," No, not anymore. I wanna stay here and become the new Wicked Witch.
",69,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth10974,Farnsworth," Nonsense. Now click your big, honking boots together three times and wish to go home to Kansas, to live in poverty with your dirt-farming, teetotalling aunt and uncle.
",169,50,3,18,Leela,Leela10975,Leela," Uh, alright. Here I go.  There's no place like-- I wanna be a witch!  Oh, no! Help! What's happening?
",103,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Zoidberg10976,Zoidberg," Uh, sorry. I think there's a problem with your upstairs toilet.
",65,50,3,18,Leela,Bender10977,Bender," Wake up!
",10,50,3,18,Zoidberg,Fry10978,Fry," Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
",53,50,3,18,Bender,Leela10979,Leela," I was having the most wonderful dream.  Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there.
",104,50,3,18,Fry,Fry10980,Fry," Never mind, Professor. She came to.
",37,50,3,18,Leela,Farnsworth10981,Farnsworth," Oh! So close.
",15,50,3,18,Fry,Hermes10982,Hermes," There's always next year, Professor. There's always next year.
",64,50,3,18,Farnsworth,Fry10983,Fry," I've never seen a supernova blow up, but if it's anything like my old Chevy Nova, it'll light up the night sky!
",113,51,3,19,Hermes,Bender10984,Bender," Yeah! Anyone who misses this will regret it the rest of his life. Hey, Fry, could you go make some popcorn?
",109,51,3,19,Fry,Fry10985,Fry," OK.
",5,51,3,19,Bender,Fry10986,Fry," Let's go, microwave, I'm in a hurry here!  Hm?  Hey, what smells like blue?
",77,51,3,19,Fry,Leela10987,Leela,"  Fry, get up here! It's starting!
",35,51,3,19,Fry,Farnsworth10988,Farnsworth," Focus!
",8,51,3,19,Leela,Bender10989,Bender," Oh, boy!
",10,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Leela10990,Leela," Oh!
",5,51,3,19,Bender,Fry10991,Fry," Hey, which crazy thing happening are you guys screaming about?
",64,51,3,19,Leela,Zoidberg10992,Zoidberg," My head is spinning.
",22,51,3,19,Fry,Fry10993,Fry," Ooh! My popcorn's done!
",25,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Fry10994,Fry," Aw! It's less popped than ever.
",33,51,3,19,Fry,Leela10995,Leela," I don't know what happened, but we've taken on a lot of clocks.  Let's get back home.
",87,51,3,19,Fry,Leela10996,Leela," Why is there so little traffic around Earth?
",46,51,3,19,Leela,Farnsworth10997,Farnsworth," And what's this layer of ozone? That's never been there before.
",65,51,3,19,Leela,Zoidberg10998,Zoidberg," Such noises!
",14,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Leela10999,Leela," Oh, no! There's no global positioning signal! Navigation is failing.
",70,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Fry11000,Fry," We're gonna crash!
",20,51,3,19,Leela,Leela11001,Leela," Not if I can help it!  Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone, put on your seatbelts.
",78,51,3,19,Fry,Bender11002,Bender," Ah, those things cost more lives than they save.
",50,51,3,19,Leela,Fry11003,Fry," Bender, are you OK?
",21,51,3,19,Bender,Bender11004,Bender," I dunno. I'll try to move my feet.
",36,51,3,19,Fry,Leela11005,Leela," Alright, here's the plan: Zoidberg, pick up the pieces. Everyone else, take five.
",83,51,3,19,Bender,Zoidberg11006,Zoidberg," And Zoidberg picks up another piece. The crowd goes wild!  What is?
",69,51,3,19,Leela,Man #111007,Man #1," General, in all my years of covering top secret discoveries with sheets, I've never dramatically revealed anything as shocking as this. Dun-dun-dun! The debris from an alien spaceship.
",186,51,3,19,Zoidberg,General11008,General," Son, I think I can safely say--
",33,51,3,19,Man #1,Man #111009,Man #1," As you can see, 1947 is going to be an eventful year for the town of ... Roswell, New Mexico.
",95,51,3,19,General,Farnsworth11010,Farnsworth," Remarkable! According the high-precision digital chronograph it's July 9th, 1947, which would explain why the chronograph has turned into this pin-up calendar.
",161,51,3,19,Man #1,Bender11011,Bender," Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?
",52,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11012,Farnsworth," Doy! Some idiot must have put metal in the microwave--
",56,51,3,19,Bender,Fry11013,Fry," Yo!
",5,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11014,Farnsworth," And the microwave radiation, combined with the gravitons and graviolis from the supernova, blasted us through time itself.
",124,51,3,19,Fry,Leela11015,Leela," Have you seen today's news?
",29,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Bender11016,Bender," High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!
",55,51,3,19,Leela,Leela11017,Leela," No, over here!   Flying saucer captured!
",42,51,3,19,Bender,Bender11018,Bender," That's no flying saucer! That's my ass!
",41,51,3,19,Leela,Fry11019,Fry," My God! This means the flying saucer that crashed in Roswell ... was us!
",74,51,3,19,Bender,Farnsworth11020,Farnsworth," And the alien they captured was ... was...
",44,51,3,19,Fry,Zoidberg11021,Zoidberg," Hello!  So what are you guys doing tonight? I'm up for whatever.
",66,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11022,Farnsworth," Yes, we tore the universe a new space-hole alright! But it's clenching shut fast. Our only hope to get back to our own time is to go through it in, oh, say ...  ... exactly 24 hours.
",184,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Leela11023,Leela," No problem. The ship's fixed except for the cup holder and I should have that operational within 10 hours.
",108,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11024,Farnsworth," You've got eight! But a more urgent concern is the microwave.  Without a working one we have no hope of returning to the future.
",130,51,3,19,Leela,Leela11025,Leela," Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave somewhere around here.  Meanwhile, you guys sneak onto the army base and rescue Bender's body.
",134,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Fry11026,Fry," Hey, and while we're on the base, I'll visit my grandfather, Enos. He was stationed at Roswell.
",97,51,3,19,Leela,Farnsworth11027,Farnsworth," Your grandfather?  Stay away from him, you dim-witted monkey! You mustn't interfere with the past. Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to do it. In which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!
",242,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11028,Fry," Got it.
",9,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11029,Farnsworth," If, for example, you were to kill your grandfather, you would cease to exist.
",79,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11030,Fry," But existing is basically all I do!
",37,51,3,19,Farnsworth,General11031,General," What is your purpose here?
",28,51,3,19,Fry,Zoidberg11032,Zoidberg,"  Alright, Officer, I'll move along.
",37,51,3,19,General,Man #111033,Man #1," What the general means is why did you come to Earth?
",54,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Zoidberg11034,Zoidberg," Not a day goes by I don't ask myself the same question.
",57,51,3,19,Man #1,Sergeant11035,Sergeant,"  Enos!  Private, I want that toilet bowl so clean I could eat off it! 'Cause I intend to!
",91,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Enos11036,Enos," Well gadzooks, Sarge!
",23,51,3,19,Sergeant,Fry11037,Fry," It's him! It's my grandfather, Enos.
",38,51,3,19,Enos,Sergeant11038,Sergeant,"  Now prepare my lunch and place it in the latrine at twelve-hundred hours!
",76,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11039,Fry," That Jeep's gonna hit him! And I won't exist anymore!  Are you crazy? You almost got yourself run over!
",105,51,3,19,Sergeant,Enos11040,Enos," I did? Then I sure am lucky you knocked me onto this pile of rusty bayonets!
",78,51,3,19,Fry,Bender11041,Bender," Pst! Fry! Stop interfering with history. I don't wanna have to memorise a lot of new kings when I get back.
",109,51,3,19,Enos,Fry11042,Fry,"  I had no choice; I was about to not exist. I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear.
",97,51,3,19,Bender,Enos11043,Enos," Well, thanks, soldier. I'm off to make Sarge's lunch! Handling raw chicken, best part of the job!  Mmm! Finger-licking good!
",126,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11044,Fry," That's it! This place is too dangerous. We gotta get you out of here!   Everything's gonna be alright, Dad!
",109,51,3,19,Enos,Enos11045,Enos," Well gadzooks! I'd better ask Sarge.
",38,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11046,Fry,"  No time! Run! Run to safety!
",31,51,3,19,Enos,Man #111047,Man #1," This experiment will determine what food, if any, the alien eats.
",67,51,3,19,Fry,Zoidberg11048,Zoidberg," A buffet! Oh, if only I had my wallet with me!
",48,51,3,19,Man #1,Man #111049,Man #1," Um, it's free.
",16,51,3,19,Zoidberg,General11050,General," Get me the President.
",23,51,3,19,Man #1,Leela11051,Leela," Fry's from around this time. I'll talk like him.  Yo, homes! We're looking for a microwave oven.
",98,51,3,19,General,Salesman #111052,Salesman #1," Microwave? Never heard of that brand, sweetheart. What you want is the ""Deluxe Gas Princess"".  This beauty has four broilers, a casserole indicator, a fold-out ironing board and, down here, a foot-soaking tub. Since, as a woman, you'll be standing in front of it all day.
",273,51,3,19,Leela,Leela11053,Leela," Oh, I'm sorry. Now I'll aks you again: Where can we find a mi-cro-wave?
",73,51,3,19,Salesman #1,Salesman #111054,Salesman #1," Sir, your wife's hysterical, so I'll address this to you. This oven is lightning fast. It takes only five hours to cook a roast.
",130,51,3,19,Leela,Farnsworth11055,Farnsworth," Ooh, that's good news! You know, you really don't cook enough roasts, Leela.  Women!
",86,51,3,19,Salesman #1,Fry11056,Fry," Thank God I got you off that dangerous army base.
",51,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Enos11057,Enos," You sure are the helpful type, stranger. Say, you got anything to eat in that there lunchbox?  Ooh! Snacks!
",109,51,3,19,Fry,Bender11058,Bender," Hey! That's my brain!
",23,51,3,19,Enos,Enos11059,Enos," Damn! Them crackers cut my mouth up somethin' bad! Let's stop off for a malt.
",79,51,3,19,Bender,Enos11060,Enos," See that waitress there?
",26,51,3,19,Enos,Fry11061,Fry," Yowza! I know what I want for dessert!
",40,51,3,19,Enos,Enos11062,Enos," That's my fiancÃ©e, Mildred.
",29,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11063,Fry," Grandma Mildred? Uh, no dessert! Just coffee.
",47,51,3,19,Enos,Mildred11064,Mildred," Okie-doke. And for you, Snuggums?
",35,51,3,19,Fry,Enos11065,Enos," Uh, I'll have a pie with a fried egg on top.
",46,51,3,19,Mildred,Fry11066,Fry," She sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away.
",81,51,3,19,Enos,Enos11067,Enos," Yeah, folks say that. But did you ever get the feeling you're only going with girls 'cause you're supposed to?
",112,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11068,Fry," What? Don't ever, ever say or think that again! Please! Just concentrate on staying alive.  Fire! Look out!  Oh! You almost got neutered.
",139,51,3,19,Enos,Enos11069,Enos," Well it ain't as bad as getting killed.
",41,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11070,Fry," For me it is!  I'm getting you outta here!
",44,51,3,19,Enos,Enos11071,Enos," Ow!
",5,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11072,Fry," OK, we're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere. Just stay put and enjoy this calendar.
",113,51,3,19,Enos,Fry11073,Fry," Safe and sound! Finally, I can continue to exist.
",51,51,3,19,Fry,Man #1 #211074,Man #1 #2," Three, two, one.
",18,51,3,19,Fry,Bender11075,Bender," And you are outta here!
",25,51,3,19,Man #1 #2,Mildred11076,Mildred," What'll you folks have today?
",31,51,3,19,Bender,Farnsworth11077,Farnsworth," I'll have the soylent green, with a slice of soylent orange and some soylent coleslaw.
",88,51,3,19,Mildred,Mildred11078,Mildred," Pardon?
",9,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Leela11079,Leela,"  It's the 20th century, Professor.
",36,51,3,19,Mildred,Farnsworth11080,Farnsworth," Oh, right! I'll have a croque monsieur, the paella, two mutton pills and a stein of mead.
",91,51,3,19,Leela,Leela11081,Leela," I'll just have a small injection of Femislim.
",47,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Mildred11082,Mildred," Uh, two chilli dogs comin' up.
",32,51,3,19,Leela,Leela11083,Leela," Well, settle in. Without a microwave we're trapped in this time period.
",73,51,3,19,Mildred,Farnsworth11084,Farnsworth," Oh, Lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the Big Bopper and then the terrible tragedy of his death.
",113,51,3,19,Leela,Leela11085,Leela," Wait a second! There's a microwave radar dish at the army base.  We could steal it!
",85,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11086,Farnsworth," No! That would alter history. Above all else, it is our sacred duty to preserve the past exactly as it was.
",109,51,3,19,Leela,Fry11087,Fry," Well, I killed my grandfather.
",32,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11088,Farnsworth," Wha?
",6,51,3,19,Fry,Leela11089,Leela," Wait. If you killed your grandfather, why do you still exist?
",63,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Fry11090,Fry," I dunno. Maybe God loves me.
",30,51,3,19,Leela,Mildred11091,Mildred," Killed? In an atomic blast?  No, sir, I'm afraid I don't take much solace in the fact that the implosion trigger functioned perfectly.
",136,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11092,Fry," Aw. There, there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vaporised so there's no chance of him coming back as a zombie.
",128,51,3,19,Mildred,Mildred11093,Mildred,"  I'm not worried about that.
",30,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11094,Fry," Then you're a braver woman than I.
",36,51,3,19,Mildred,Mildred11095,Mildred," You remind me of Enos. Would you mind walking me home?
",56,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11096,Fry," Uh, how far is it?
",20,51,3,19,Mildred,General11097,General," Welcome to Roswell, President Truman.
",39,51,3,19,Fry,Truman11098,Truman," Fellas, this visit's top secret. No one's to know about it except the senior officers ...  ... scientists ...  ... and a single conspiracy nutter no one will believe.
",168,51,3,19,General,General11099,General," Mr. President, our men have assembled the parts from the alien ship into its original design.
",95,51,3,19,Truman,Truman11100,Truman," Whistling Dixie! I want this sent to Area 51 for study.
",57,51,3,19,General,General11101,General," But, sir, that's where we're building the fake moon landing set.
",66,51,3,19,Truman,Truman11102,Truman," Then we'll have to really land on the moon. Invent NASA and tell them to get off their fannies!
",97,51,3,19,General,Truman11103,Truman," If you come in peace, surrender or be destroyed. If you're here to make war, we surrender.
",92,51,3,19,Truman,Zoidberg11104,Zoidberg," Both good. The important thing is I'm meeting new people.
",59,51,3,19,Truman,Truman11105,Truman," Bushwah! Now what's your mission? Are you planning to make some kind of alien-human hybrid?
",93,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Zoidberg11106,Zoidberg," Are you coming onto me?
",25,51,3,19,Truman,Truman11107,Truman," Hot crackers! I take exception to that!
",41,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Zoidberg11108,Zoidberg,"  I'm not hearing a no.
",24,51,3,19,Truman,Truman11109,Truman," Nerks to this space crab! If we want information, we'll have to do us an old-fashioned alien autopsy!
",103,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Zoidberg11110,Zoidberg," Hooray!
",9,51,3,19,Truman,Mildred11111,Mildred,"  Every little thing reminds me of Enos.
",41,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Fry11112,Fry," Aw, I know how you feel. My grandfather died recently.
",56,51,3,19,Mildred,Mildred11113,Mildred," It's all so sad. At times like this, I just need someone to hold me.  Mmm.  You like holding me, don't you?
",109,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11114,Fry," Hey, you know what always cheers you up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!
",82,51,3,19,Mildred,Mildred11115,Mildred," How 'bout these cookies, sugar?
",33,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11116,Fry," I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't even exist. But I do exist. Which proves ... you can't really be my grandm--
",111,51,3,19,Mildred,Bender11117,Bender,"  Oh, my God!
",14,51,3,19,Fry,Farnsworth11118,Farnsworth," What the hell have you done, Fry?
",35,51,3,19,Bender,Fry11119,Fry," Relax! She can't be my grandmother. I figured it all out.
",59,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11120,Farnsworth," Of course she's your grandmother, you perverted dope! Look!
",61,51,3,19,Fry,Mildred11121,Mildred," Come back to bed, deary.
",26,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Fry11122,Fry," It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?
",73,51,3,19,Mildred,Farnsworth11123,Farnsworth," Isn't it obvious?  You are!
",29,51,3,19,Fry,Mildred11124,Mildred," Did you say something, deary? I'm a bit hard of hearing.
",58,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Pathologist #111125,Pathologist #1," Commencing excavation of the subject's chest cavity.
",54,51,3,19,Mildred,Zoidberg11126,Zoidberg," And in this corner, Zoidberg!  C'mon! Lighten up! What is this, a funeral?
",76,51,3,19,Pathologist #1,Pathologist #211127,Pathologist #2," Heart.
",8,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Zoidberg11128,Zoidberg," Take, I've got four of them.
",30,51,3,19,Pathologist #2,Pathologist #111129,Pathologist #1," Stomach contents: One deviled egg.
",36,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Zoidberg11130,Zoidberg," Deviled egg?
",14,51,3,19,Pathologist #1,Pathologist #111131,Pathologist #1," The same deviled egg.
",23,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Leela11132,Leela," Snap out of it!
",17,51,3,19,Pathologist #1,Farnsworth11133,Farnsworth," Start the ship, Leela. Let's just steal the damn radar dish and get back to our own time.
",91,51,3,19,Leela,Fry11134,Fry," But-- But won't that change history?
",38,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11135,Farnsworth,"  Oh, a lesson in not changing history from Mr. I'm-My-Own-Grandpa! Let's get the hell out of here already! Screw history!
",123,51,3,19,Fry,Conspiracy Nutter11136,Conspiracy Nutter," UFO! UFO!
",11,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Zoidberg11137,Zoidberg," Hey, don't cut that! I need that to speak!
",44,51,3,19,Conspiracy Nutter,Pathologist #211138,Pathologist #2," Oh, my!
",9,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Truman11139,Truman," Sweet Roosevelt's ghost!
",26,51,3,19,Pathologist #2,Leela11140,Leela," Hi-yah!  Yah!  Yah!
",21,51,3,19,Truman,Fry11141,Fry," Take this, Mr. President-- Sir!
",33,51,3,19,Leela,Zoidberg11142,Zoidberg," The President is gagging on my gas bladder! What an honour!
",61,51,3,19,Fry,Farnsworth11143,Farnsworth," Huh, wha? Oh, right!
",22,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Sergeant11144,Sergeant,"  Enos!
",8,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Fry11145,Fry,"  He's dead! Sorry!
",20,51,3,19,Sergeant,Fry11146,Fry," Yay!
",6,51,3,19,Fry,Farnsworth11147,Farnsworth," Choke on that, causality!
",27,51,3,19,Fry,Bender11148,Bender,"  1947 can kiss my shiny metal--
",33,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Fry11149,Fry," Turn around. We've gotta go back for Bender!
",46,51,3,19,Bender,Farnsworth11150,Farnsworth," Impossible! The supernova time hole is closing! If we don't leave now, we'll never get back to the 31st century.
",114,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11151,Fry,"  Bender!
",10,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Zoidberg11152,Zoidberg," There! Good as new!
",21,51,3,19,Fry,Leela11153,Leela," Don't you need this one?
",26,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Zoidberg11154,Zoidberg," Oh, no! That's my--  Gotcha!
",30,51,3,19,Leela,Fry11155,Fry," Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely right now, trapped a thousand years in the past. Hey! Wait a second!
",108,51,3,19,Zoidberg,Leela11156,Leela," Anything?
",11,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11157,Fry," No.  Wait!
",12,51,3,19,Leela,Bender11158,Bender," Ow! Stupid junk!
",18,51,3,19,Fry,Fry11159,Fry," He's alive!  Bender, what was it like lying in that hole for a thousand years?
",80,51,3,19,Bender,Bender11160,Bender," I was enjoying it until you guys showed up.
",45,51,3,19,Fry,Farnsworth11161,Farnsworth," Well, now everything is back as it was. And if history doesn't care that out degenerate friend Fry is his own grandfather then who are we to judge?
",149,51,3,19,Bender,Bender11162,Bender," Amen!
",7,51,3,19,Farnsworth,Leela11163,Leela," Space pirates!
",16,52,3,20,Bender,Fry11164,Fry," Space pirates?
",16,52,3,20,Leela,Leela11165,Leela," You know. Pirates, but in space.
",34,52,3,20,Fry,Pirate11166,Pirate,"  Avast, mateys!
",17,52,3,20,Leela,Pirate11167,Pirate," Electronically transfer your space doubloons, afore I send thee to Davey Jarg's locker!
",89,52,3,20,Pirate,Bender11168,Bender,"  Hey! Keep it down, you kids! I'm trying to take a nap!
",57,52,3,20,Pirate,Fry11169,Fry," Come on! Come on!
",19,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11170,Bender,"  Make Bender take a nap in a tube.   Come back when I've had some sleep, baby!
",80,52,3,20,Fry,Leela11171,Leela," Fry to battlestations. Fire torpedo number three.
",51,52,3,20,Bender,Fry11172,Fry," Firing torpedo number three!
",30,52,3,20,Leela,Bender11173,Bender," Huh? What?
",12,52,3,20,Fry,Leela11174,Leela," That's not torpedo three. That's not torpedo three at all!
",60,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11175,Bender," Damn you, Fry and Lee--  --la!
",32,52,3,20,Leela,Pirate11176,Pirate,"  Too late do I realise that me children are me only real treasures.
",69,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11177,Bender,"  Help! Mechanical man overboard!
",34,52,3,20,Pirate,Fry11178,Fry," Go after him, Leela!
",22,52,3,20,Bender,Leela11179,Leela," It's no use. We were going full speed when we fired him so he's going even faster than that.
",94,52,3,20,Fry,Fry11180,Fry," You mean we can never catch up to him? Not even if we rub the engine with cheetah blood?
",90,52,3,20,Leela,Leela11181,Leela," I don't know how to say this, Fry, but Bender is doomed to drift through space ... forever.
",93,52,3,20,Fry,Fry11182,Fry,"  He always wanted to drift forever, but through the American Southwest.
",73,52,3,20,Leela,Bender11183,Bender," I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose momentum.  I'm gonna spend eternity alone with barely any swag.  Ooh! Hey, universe, check out the dude with the Rolex!  Wow! Ostentatious!  Except what good is a candelabra without-- Wait! I know!  Ah, the pity. Fated to drift forever through the void as gravity's plaything. Oh, cruel fate, to be thusly boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones. It bones for thee. The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art.  Damn you!
",515,52,3,20,Fry,Bender11184,Bender," There! Now when I'm found in a million years people will know what the score was.  Hey! what's bombarding me?  Oh, no! An asteroid field. If even a pea-sized asteroid were to whiz through my skull it could--  Ow! Hurt slightly!  Well that was fun. Now for eons of loneliness.
",277,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11185,Bender," Huh?
",6,52,3,20,Bender,Shrimpkin Priest11186,Shrimpkin Priest," Fellow Shrimpkins, behold him who hath taken us unto his breast.
",66,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11187,Bender," Holy frijoles!
",16,52,3,20,Shrimpkin Priest,Shrimpkin Priest11188,Shrimpkin Priest," All bow before the great Metal Lord!
",38,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11189,Bender," Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless, tragic voyage.
",64,52,3,20,Shrimpkin Priest,Shrimpkin Priest11190,Shrimpkin Priest," All hail the Metal Lord!
",26,52,3,20,Bender,Shrimpkins11191,Shrimpkins,"  So hailed!
",13,52,3,20,Shrimpkin Priest,Bender11192,Bender," Hmm. Those peewees think I'm God, huh? Hard to blame 'em!  I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?
",94,52,3,20,Shrimpkins,Malachi11193,Malachi," I am called Malachi, Lord. It means, um, ""He who really loves the Metal Lord"".
",80,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11194,Bender," Listen here, Malachi. Time for a religious donation. Hand over your wallet.
",77,52,3,20,Malachi,Malachi11195,Malachi," But, Lord, we are a poor and simple folk.
",43,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11196,Bender," Poor? Oh, crap.
",17,52,3,20,Malachi,Malachi11197,Malachi," Pity me not, for I am richened by the love of my family.
",58,52,3,20,Bender,Malachis Wife11198,Malachis Wife," What art thou doing, Malachi Jr.?
",35,52,3,20,Malachi,Malachi Jr.11199,Malachi Jr.," I'm practising to hug Daddy when he gets back from God.  Mmm! Mmm!
",68,52,3,20,Malachis Wife,Bender11200,Bender," Eck! Gag unto me with a spoon! Malachi, it's high time I laid down a few commandments. You got a chisel? Take this down.  Number one...
",137,52,3,20,Malachi Jr.,Malachi11201,Malachi," Behold: The One Commandment.
",30,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11202,Bender,"  Make it a double!
",20,52,3,20,Malachi,Fry11203,Fry," Can you find him, Professor?
",30,52,3,20,Bender,Farnsworth11204,Farnsworth," No. I'm afraid the Smellescope isn't powerful enough. Bender's odour is so mild it's being overpowered by local sources.
",122,52,3,20,Fry,Zoidberg11205,Zoidberg," Hooray! People are paying attention to me!
",44,52,3,20,Farnsworth,Amy11206,Amy," Fry, we brought someone to cheer you up.
",42,52,3,20,Zoidberg,Hermes11207,Hermes," His name is Helper and he's eager to be your new best friend.
",63,52,3,20,Amy,Helper11208,Helper," Hello there, chum. I understand you miss your buddy. Have a pudding pop!
",74,52,3,20,Hermes,Fry11209,Fry," No, thanks, I don't--
",23,52,3,20,Helper,Helper11210,Helper," Who wants to go to an amusement park?
",39,52,3,20,Fry,Fry11211,Fry," Well, I guess that sounds OK.
",31,52,3,20,Helper,Helper11212,Helper," Have a good time. Hey, I heard your friend Bender is back.
",60,52,3,20,Fry,Fry11213,Fry," What? Really?
",15,52,3,20,Helper,Helper11214,Helper," No. I just thought you would enjoy that for a moment.
",55,52,3,20,Fry,Bender11215,Bender," Ooh! Microbrewed! My guys did alright! I think I'll make my countenance to shine down upon them.  Malachi, good work. There's no slowing down with the Metal Lord tonight.
",172,52,3,20,Helper,Malachi11216,Malachi," Yes, tonight is kind of special.
",34,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11217,Bender," Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?
",56,52,3,20,Malachi,Malachi11218,Malachi," Nay. Like most of your followers, I was maimed while building the Great Brewery.  Others died from the pestilent fumes it spewed forth.  And, of course, the liquor industry attracted organised crime.
",201,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11219,Bender," It's all my fault. Malachi, tell thy people that the Lord is moved by their plight.
",85,52,3,20,Malachi,Malachis Wife11220,Malachis Wife," Malachi Jr., no!
",18,52,3,20,Bender,Malachi Jr.11221,Malachi Jr.," Daddy, I can't hold much longer. My arms are tired from hugging.
",66,52,3,20,Malachis Wife,Malachi11222,Malachi," Save him! Save my son, oh Metal Lord!
",39,52,3,20,Malachi Jr.,Bender11223,Bender," This looks like a job for God!  What the-- Malachi, what manner of deal is this with the chanting?
",100,52,3,20,Malachi,Malachi11224,Malachi," They saw you save my son. Now everyone is praying for their own miracles.
",75,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11225,Bender," Very well. What do they want?
",31,52,3,20,Malachi,Malachi11226,Malachi," The people of that village pray for wealth.
",45,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11227,Bender," Um, that was a practice miracle. Who's next?
",46,52,3,20,Malachi,Malachi11228,Malachi," The farmers pray for sunlight so their barley might make a more refreshing beer for today's God on the go.
",108,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11229,Bender," Very well. Let there be light.  I got it! I got it!  Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle.
",131,52,3,20,Malachi,Fry11230,Fry," He decided not to let go.  I can't believe you're gone. I won't! If I can't reach you physically, I'll just have to try something desperate and crazy!
",152,52,3,20,Bender,Fry11231,Fry," So that's my story, Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion can do to help me find my friend?
",111,52,3,20,Fry,Changstein el Gamahl11232,Changstein el Gamahl," Well, we could join together in prayer.
",41,52,3,20,Fry,Fry11233,Fry," Uh-huh. But is there anything useful we can do?
",49,52,3,20,Changstein el Gamahl,Changstein el Gamahl11234,Changstein el Gamahl," No.
",5,52,3,20,Fry,Gypsy11235,Gypsy," Sure I hold sÃ©ance, channel your friend, no problem. Insert coin.  I am your friend, Bonder.
",94,52,3,20,Changstein el Gamahl,Fry11236,Fry," Bonder? Is it really you?
",27,52,3,20,Gypsy,Gypsy11237,Gypsy," Yes. I am fine. Give the gypsy $10.
",37,52,3,20,Fry,Fry11238,Fry," Wait a minute! Bender's name isn't Bonder, it's Bender. You're a fraud!
",73,52,3,20,Gypsy,Gypsy11239,Gypsy," Look, you want false hope or not?
",35,52,3,20,Fry,Fry11240,Fry," Only if you don't have any real hope.
",39,52,3,20,Gypsy,Gypsy11241,Gypsy," Well, there is perhaps one way. Have you heard of the Monks of Dschubba?
",74,52,3,20,Fry,Fry11242,Fry," I've not heard of them.
",25,52,3,20,Gypsy,Gypsy11243,Gypsy," They are an ancient order that believes God exists somewhere in the depths of space. They have built the universe's most powerful radio telescope, high in the Himalayas, to search for him.
",190,52,3,20,Fry,Fry11244,Fry," You think they'd let me use it to look for Bender?
",52,52,3,20,Gypsy,Gypsy11245,Gypsy," What am I, psychic? I mean, yes! Yes, I'm-I'm sure they will. Yes.
",68,52,3,20,Fry,Malachi11246,Malachi," Oh, Metal Lord, hear my prayer.
",33,52,3,20,Gypsy,Bender11247,Bender,"  Yes, Malachi, what is it this time?
",38,52,3,20,Malachi,Malachi11248,Malachi," My Lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say their prayers go unheeded.
",98,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11249,Bender," Of course they're unheeded. How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?
",85,52,3,20,Malachi,Malachi11250,Malachi," They talk of war against the faithful. I beseech thee. Rise up against them. Smite someone who deserves it for once.
",118,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11251,Bender," Malachi, every time I interfere, I only make things worse. You're best off solving your own problems.
",103,52,3,20,Malachi,Malachi11252,Malachi," But-But Metal Lord.
",21,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11253,Bender," What part of ""nay"" doesn't thou understand?
",45,52,3,20,Malachi,Fry11254,Fry," Sir, I'm outfitting an expedition to a monastery high in the Himalayas. I'll need a long-sleeved coat.
",104,52,3,20,Bender,Leela11255,Leela," Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do but you can't bring him back this way. It's hopeless.
",105,52,3,20,Fry,Fry11256,Fry," You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless. You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go ""blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!""   I'd also like a pack mule.
",183,52,3,20,Leela,Salesman #111257,Salesman #1,"  At once, sir!
",16,52,3,20,Fry,Leela11258,Leela," Well, you obviously won't listen to reason, so I guess I'll listen to idiotic-ness and come with you. But we'll need a sherpa to guide us.
",140,52,3,20,Salesman #1,Bender11259,Bender," Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint on every page! Looks like society's running pretty well without my meddling--  Atomic bombs? Oh, no! Those unbelievers from my backside must have found my nuclear pile!
",215,52,3,20,Leela,Malachi11260,Malachi," Fear not, my Lord. We shall be with you soon.
",47,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11261,Bender," You're with me now. This is the maximum level of being with me!
",65,52,3,20,Malachi,Malachi11262,Malachi," We will solve our own problems as you commanded. The time has come to convert the unbelievers.
",96,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11263,Bender," Convert them?
",15,52,3,20,Malachi,Malachi11264,Malachi," To radioactive vapour!
",24,52,3,20,Bender,Malachi Jr.11265,Malachi Jr.," Look, Daddy! I'm hugging God. Mmm! Mmm! Maybe if I hug him real hard he'll save us from--
",91,52,3,20,Malachi,Bender11266,Bender,"  No!   Ooh! It tickles!
",25,52,3,20,Malachi Jr.,Bender11267,Bender," Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theatre?  Don't be embarrassed.   They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences?
",184,52,3,20,Bender,Leela11268,Leela,"  Fry, if I drop dead from exhaustion, make sure my body freezes in a dignified position. None of that ""huddled over for warmth"" crap.
",135,52,3,20,Bender,Namgyal11269,Namgyal," Behold. The Monastery of Dschubba. I must leave you now for I am not holy enough to enter.
",92,52,3,20,Leela,Fry11270,Fry," OK.
",5,52,3,20,Namgyal,Leela11271,Leela," Looks rickety. We'd better test it.
",37,52,3,20,Fry,Female Voice11272,Female Voice," Welcome to our monastery. Please stand to one side to let faster pilgrims by.
",79,52,3,20,Leela,Bender11273,Bender," Hey! That galaxy's signalling in binary. I gotta signal back. But I only know enough binary to ask where the bathroom is.  You speak English?
",143,52,3,20,Female Voice,Galaxy11274,Galaxy," I do now.
",11,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11275,Bender," What are you? Some kind of galactic computer?
",47,52,3,20,Galaxy,Galaxy11276,Galaxy," Possible. I am user friendly, my good chum.
",45,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11277,Bender," Who built you?
",16,52,3,20,Galaxy,Galaxy11278,Galaxy," I have always been.
",21,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11279,Bender," Oh, my God. Are you God?
",26,52,3,20,Galaxy,God11280,God," Possible. I do feel compassion for all living things, my good chum.
",69,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11281,Bender," But why would God think in binary? Unless ... you're not God, but the remains of a computerised space probe that collided with God.
",133,52,3,20,God,God11282,God," That seems probable.
",22,52,3,20,Bender,Monk #111283,Monk #1," A member of our brotherhood sits at these controls every hour of every day, scanning the heavens for God.
",107,52,3,20,God,Monk #211284,Monk #2," There he is! No. No, wait, no.
",32,52,3,20,Monk #1,Leela11285,Leela," How long have you been at it?
",31,52,3,20,Monk #2,Monk #111286,Monk #1," 700 years. We've not yet examined one-ten-millionth of the sky. But we will go on until we find the Almighty, even if it takes till the end of time.
",150,52,3,20,Leela,Fry11287,Fry," And then what?
",16,52,3,20,Monk #1,Monk #111288,Monk #1," Then we utter unto him a short prayer. You see, the telescope is also an amplifying transmitter.
",98,52,3,20,Fry,Leela11289,Leela," Sort of like a giant karaoke machine?
",39,52,3,20,Monk #1,Monk #111290,Monk #1," Not really. Would you like to see our giant karaoke machine?
",62,52,3,20,Leela,Leela11291,Leela," Not really.
",13,52,3,20,Monk #1,Fry11292,Fry," Hmm. Finding God. That-That's important, yeah. But you know what might be a treat for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend, Bender.
",161,52,3,20,Leela,Monk #111293,Monk #1," I don't know what to say, other than ""absolutely not"". Your loss is a tragedy but our work--
",94,52,3,20,Fry,Fry11294,Fry," Aw, come on! You guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one measly lifetime to find my friend.
",110,52,3,20,Monk #1,Monk #211295,Monk #2," He speaks out of love for his friend. Perhaps that love in his heart is God.
",78,52,3,20,Fry,Monk #111296,Monk #1," Oh, how convenient! A theory about God that doesn't require looking through a telescope. Get back to work!
",108,52,3,20,Monk #2,Fry11297,Fry," That telescope is as much mine as anybody's. I'm using it whether you give me permission or not.
",98,52,3,20,Monk #1,Leela11298,Leela," Hi-yah! Your order may be famous for your martial arts, but I've never met a holy man I couldn't clobber.
",107,52,3,20,Fry,Monk #111299,Monk #1," Actually, we only practise martial arts as a form of meditation. We are a strictly non-violent sect.
",102,52,3,20,Leela,Leela11300,Leela," Oh. Then get in the laundry room or I'll kick your butts!
",59,52,3,20,Monk #1,Monk #311301,Monk #3," This is the worst crazy sect I've ever been in.
",49,52,3,20,Leela,Bender11302,Bender," So, do you know what I'm gonna do before I do it?
",51,52,3,20,Monk #3,God11303,God," Yes.
",6,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11304,Bender," What if I do something different?
",35,52,3,20,God,God11305,God," Then I don't know that.
",25,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11306,Bender," Cool! Cool! I bet a lot of people pray to you, huh?
",53,52,3,20,God,God11307,God," Yes. But there are so many asking so much. After a while, you just sorta tune it out.
",87,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11308,Bender," Y'know, I was God once.
",25,52,3,20,God,God11309,God," Yes, I saw. You were doing well until everyone died.
",54,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11310,Bender," It was awful. I tried helping them, I tried not helping them but in the end I couldn't do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?
",141,52,3,20,God,God11311,God," Right and wrong are just words. What matters is what you do.
",62,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11312,Bender," Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what I did-- Forget it.
",60,52,3,20,God,God11313,God," Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you. And if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch like a safecracker or a pickpocket.
",185,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11314,Bender," Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money.
",58,52,3,20,God,God11315,God," Yes, if you make it look like an electrical thing. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
",128,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11316,Bender," Does that mean you wouldn't send me back to Earth even if I prayed to you?
",76,52,3,20,God,God11317,God," Earth? Which way is that?
",27,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11318,Bender,"  I don't know.
",16,52,3,20,God,Fry11319,Fry,"  Bender? Bender?
",18,52,3,20,Bender,Monk #211320,Monk #2,"  Let us out! We cooked our shoes in the dryer and ate them. Now we're bored.
",78,52,3,20,Fry,Fry11321,Fry,"  Hello? Has anyone out there seen Bender?
",43,52,3,20,Monk #2,H.G. Blob11322,H.G. Blob,"  No! Quit asking.
",19,52,3,20,Fry,Leela11323,Leela," Fry, it's been three days. And even if you stay here the rest of your life, there is virtually no chance of finding him. It's time to give up.
",144,52,3,20,H.G. Blob,Fry11324,Fry,"  You're right. I'm never gonna see him again. I know he was evil and on more than one occasion he-he actually stole my blood.  But still, I wish I had Bender back.
",165,52,3,20,Leela,God11325,God," Huh?
",6,52,3,20,Fry,Bender11326,Bender," Huh? Wha? You say something?
",30,52,3,20,God,God11327,God," No, no. Well, so long. Remember what we talked about.
",55,52,3,20,Bender,Bender11328,Bender," Hot, hot, hot, hot!
",21,52,3,20,God,Fry11329,Fry," Bender! It's a miracle!  Ow!
",30,52,3,20,Bender,Leela11330,Leela," This is, by a wide margin, the least likely thing that has ever happened.
",75,52,3,20,Fry,Bender11331,Bender," Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God, then I met God!
",76,52,3,20,Leela,Fry11332,Fry," We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks.
",49,52,3,20,Bender,Leela11333,Leela," Oh, no! The monks! We forgot to let them out of the laundry room.
",67,52,3,20,Fry,Fry11334,Fry," Do we have to? I mean, they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them out or at least give them more shoes to eat.
",117,52,3,20,Leela,Bender11335,Bender," Fat chance! You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me so himself. Now come on. If we don't save those monks, no one will!
",137,52,3,20,Fry,God11336,God," When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
",77,52,3,20,Bender,Man #111337,Man #1," Yes! Good thing I noticed the similar shapes.
",47,53,3,21,God,Hermes11338,Hermes,"  Planet Express stockholders, I present our chief executive officer, Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
",99,53,3,21,Man #1,Farnsworth11339,Farnsworth," Oh!
",5,53,3,21,Hermes,Amy11340,Amy," There he is!
",14,53,3,21,Farnsworth,Hattie McDoogal11341,Hattie McDoogal,"  Take it off!
",15,53,3,21,Amy,Farnsworth11342,Farnsworth," Where am I?
",13,53,3,21,Hattie McDoogal,Hermes11343,Hermes," Move forward. Walk into the light.
",36,53,3,21,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11344,Farnsworth," Oh, God, I'm dead! Well, no matter.   Thank you all for coming. I don't recognise any of you, nor can I recall why I am here. Now, without further ado, a film highlighting Planet Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year.
",215,53,3,21,Hermes,Narrator11345,Narrator,"  Planet Express is on the move. For this hip, young delivery company, tomorrow is today and today is yesterday. You heard me.  It was a year of soaring profits and significant one-time losses.
",194,53,3,21,Farnsworth,Fry11346,Fry,"  Psst! Watching myself work is making me hungry. Help me find some food somewhere.
",84,53,3,21,Narrator,Zoidberg11347,Zoidberg," I'll not only help you find it, I'll help you do more to it!
",62,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11348,Fry," Ooh! A Bot Mitzvah. Shalom, hunger! Shalom, free food!
",56,53,3,21,Zoidberg,Robot #1 #111349,Robot #1 #1," No shellfish!
",15,53,3,21,Fry,Zoidberg11350,Zoidberg," That is so unfair!
",20,53,3,21,Robot #1 #1,Pig11351,Pig," Tell me about it.
",19,53,3,21,Zoidberg,Fry11352,Fry," So what's the deal? You guys don't believe in Robot Jesus?
",60,53,3,21,Pig,Rabbi-bot11353,Rabbi-bot," We believe he was built and that he was a very well programmed robot. But he wasn't our Messiah.
",98,53,3,21,Fry,Narrator11354,Narrator,"  And so our company flames onwards. Planet Express: Limitless potential, boundless horizons, the unstoppable juggernaut of the corporate universe.
",148,53,3,21,Rabbi-bot,Hermes11355,Hermes," It's been a terrible year, people. The company is on the verge of bankruptcy.
",79,53,3,21,Narrator,Leela11356,Leela," But the movie--
",17,53,3,21,Hermes,Hermes11357,Hermes," Was a substantial loss for the company.  The blue slice represents the money we earned from shipping packages, while the green slice represents an $8 bank error in our favour.
",177,53,3,21,Leela,Leela11358,Leela," This toads the wet sprocket. What about out thousands of shares of stock?
",75,53,3,21,Hermes,Hermes11359,Hermes," Worthless.
",12,53,3,21,Leela,Bender11360,Bender,"  I'll kill you!
",17,53,3,21,Hermes,Hattie McDoogal11361,Hattie McDoogal," I own one share of Planet kajiggers so I'm entitled to some answers. Question 1: Why does no one visit me in my home?
",119,53,3,21,Bender,Farnsworth11362,Farnsworth," 'Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee.
",57,53,3,21,Hattie McDoogal,Fry11363,Fry," This is perfect for me.
",25,53,3,21,Farnsworth,Zoidberg11364,Zoidberg," Question: Do you have to have been cryogenically frozen to get the free--  You didn't let me finish. I was going to say ""to get the free food"".
",145,53,3,21,Fry,Joe11365,Joe," My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee.
",36,53,3,21,Zoidberg,All11366,All,"  Hello, Joe.
",14,53,3,21,Joe,Joe11367,Joe," When I was frozen, giant carrots ruled the Earth, but now they don't. It takes some getting used to.
",102,53,3,21,All,Steve Castle11368,Steve Castle," Back in the 1980's, I was the toast of Wall Street. I was having whiskey with Boesky and cookies with Milken. But then, I was diagnosed with terminal boneitis.
",161,53,3,21,Joe,Fry11369,Fry," Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for a horrible disease.
",60,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11370,Steve Castle," There was no cure at the time. One drug company was close but I arranged a hostile takeover and sold off all the assets. Made a cool hundred mil.  Naturally I froze myself until a cure was found. Now here I am, ready to sleaze my way back to the top, 80's style!
",264,53,3,21,Fry,Caveman11371,Caveman," As a caveman frozen in a glacier, I face different challenges.  The hardest thing was seeing my wife on display in the British Museum.
",136,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Fry11372,Fry,"  Hey, buddy, I'm from the same time as you. Remember that song, Safety Dance?
",79,53,3,21,Caveman,Steve Castle11373,Steve Castle," Sure do! We can dance!
",24,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11374,Fry," Y'know, that dance wasn't as safe as they said it was.
",56,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11375,Steve Castle," I tell you: Two go-go 80's Reagan-auts like us, we could rule this world!
",75,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11376,Fry," No question!
",14,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11377,Steve Castle," If only someone would give us a shot.
",39,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11378,Fry," They're scared of our raw power. Oh, but if you want a job, I could beg everyone at the company where I work.
",111,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11379,Steve Castle," Awesome. Awesome to the max!
",30,53,3,21,Fry,Hermes11380,Hermes," And finally, the post office meter is for business mail only.
",63,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Bender11381,Bender," Aw, come on! I've got a lot of ransom notes to send!
",54,53,3,21,Hermes,Hattie McDoogal11382,Hattie McDoogal," Enough talk. It's time for action. I move that everyone come to my apartment to snuggle my cat.
",97,53,3,21,Bender,Scruffy11383,Scruffy," Second.
",9,53,3,21,Hattie McDoogal,Farnsworth11384,Farnsworth," I move that your cat stinks and is ugly.
",42,53,3,21,Scruffy,Scruffy11385,Scruffy," Second.
",9,53,3,21,Farnsworth,Hattie McDoogal11386,Hattie McDoogal," I move that we vote on a new chief executive officer and oust this old creep. And also that make cat smells good and is pretty.
",129,53,3,21,Scruffy,Scruffy11387,Scruffy," Second.
",9,53,3,21,Hattie McDoogal,Hermes11388,Hermes," Very well. I nominate the Professor.
",38,53,3,21,Scruffy,Amy11389,Amy," Second.
",9,53,3,21,Hermes,Leela11390,Leela," Second.
",9,53,3,21,Amy,Bender11391,Bender," Second.
",9,53,3,21,Leela,Farnsworth11392,Farnsworth," I'm your man.
",15,53,3,21,Bender,Leela11393,Leela," I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor.
",44,53,3,21,Farnsworth,Hermes11394,Hermes," Yeah, the Professor!
",22,53,3,21,Leela,Farnsworth11395,Farnsworth," Me!
",5,53,3,21,Hermes,Fry11396,Fry," I nominate That Guy. Not just because he has a suit but because he knows about business and stuff and he has a tie.  My shares still count if they went through the washing machine, right?
",189,53,3,21,Farnsworth,Hermes11397,Hermes," Well, if I know anything about which number is bigger than the other number, I'd say that--
",93,53,3,21,Fry,Scruffy11398,Scruffy," Now hold on there. Scruffy votes his 40,000 shares for the mysterious stranger.
",81,53,3,21,Hermes,Leela11399,Leela," 40,000? How come you have four-times as much stock as the rest of us?
",71,53,3,21,Scruffy,Scruffy11400,Scruffy," Scruffy believes in this company.
",35,53,3,21,Leela,Hermes11401,Hermes," Then we have a tie. And in the event of a tie, the Professor, as the current CEO remains--
",92,53,3,21,Scruffy,Hattie McDoogal11402,Hattie McDoogal," I demand the floor. I may only have one share but I get to vote same as anyone. And I'm voting against the cat-hater.  Isn't that right, kitty?  Hey! You ate my change!
",170,53,3,21,Hermes,Hermes11403,Hermes," Then it's settled. The new chief executive officer of Planet Express corporation is That Guy.
",95,53,3,21,Hattie McDoogal,Hermes11404,Hermes," Please welcome our new chief executive officer, That Guy.
",59,53,3,21,Hermes,Steve Castle11405,Steve Castle," Let's cut to the chase. There are two kinds of people: Sheep and sharks. Anyone who's a sheep is fired. Who's a sheep?
",120,53,3,21,Hermes,Zoidberg11406,Zoidberg," Uh, excuse me? Which is the one people like to hug?
",53,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11407,Steve Castle," Gutsy question. You're a shark. Sharks are winners and they don't look back 'cause they don't have necks. Necks are for sheep.  I am proud to be the shepherd of this herd of sharks and I am gonna lead you to the top in this industry of ... of--
",246,53,3,21,Zoidberg,Fry11408,Fry,"  Package delivery.
",20,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11409,Steve Castle," Package delivery? Oh, God!  Fantastic! Now, the first order of business is to blame everything on the guy before me. Professor?
",129,53,3,21,Fry,Farnsworth11410,Farnsworth," I'll ruin you like I ruined this company.
",43,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11411,Steve Castle," Terrific. Question number one: What was your overall business plan?
",69,53,3,21,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11412,Farnsworth," Um, business plan, uh, yes. I keep it here, right next to my heart.
",69,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11413,Steve Castle," This isn't a business plan, it's an escape plan.
",50,53,3,21,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11414,Farnsworth," So long, suckers!
",19,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11415,Steve Castle," Fry, as a fellow 80's dollar-jockey, I'm making you my new vice chairman.
",75,53,3,21,Farnsworth,Fry11416,Fry," I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.
",36,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Zoidberg11417,Zoidberg," It's the end of the line!
",27,53,3,21,Fry,Hermes11418,Hermes," We're ruined!
",15,53,3,21,Zoidberg,Scruffy11419,Scruffy," What fevered dream is this that bids to tear this company in twain?
",69,53,3,21,Hermes,Monster11420,Monster," Thank you, come again!
",24,53,3,21,Scruffy,Steve Castle11421,Steve Castle," That's what I call a hostile makeover! Hair gel?
",50,53,3,21,Monster,Fry11422,Fry," No, thanks. I make my own.
",28,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11423,Steve Castle," This company's gonna shoot straight to the top and stay there, like Cindy Lauper! I ask you: Who is the number one delivery service on Earth?
",143,53,3,21,Fry,Zoidberg11424,Zoidberg," Is it Planet Express, master?
",31,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11425,Steve Castle," Is this guy a shark, or what? Seriously though, we stink out loud. Here's the big enchirito.  Mom's Friendly Delivery Company.
",128,53,3,21,Zoidberg,Hermes11426,Hermes," We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil. Ours is small and neutral.
",84,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11427,Steve Castle," Switzerland is small and neutral. We're more like Germany; ambitious and misunderstood.
",89,53,3,21,Hermes,Amy11428,Amy," Look, everyone wants to be like Germany but do we really have the pure strength of will?
",90,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11429,Steve Castle," I say we do! Now are we gonna let ourselves get beaten by an old lady?
",72,53,3,21,Amy,Zoidberg11430,Zoidberg," Yes, my liege!
",16,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Fry11431,Fry," No, we're not. And as vice chairman, I believe I speak for the entire board when I issue this challenge to Mom.  Look at my butt!
",131,53,3,21,Zoidberg,Mom11432,Mom," You call that a pressed ham? Walt, hit the retaliate button.
",62,53,3,21,Fry,Walt11433,Walt," Uh ... um ... hmm ... let's see.
",34,53,3,21,Mom,Mom11434,Mom,"  Any button! They all retaliate!
",34,53,3,21,Walt,Fry11435,Fry," Woo! Yeah! Hit him, hit him, hit him!  Now this is the high life; watching apes mangle each other near celebrities.
",117,53,3,21,Mom,Steve Castle11436,Steve Castle," In my day we went to coke parties but the principle's the same.
",65,53,3,21,Fry,Calculon11437,Calculon," Get your stinkin' trike off me, you damn dirty ape.
",53,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11438,Steve Castle," Listen, big guy, now that you're my protÃ©gÃ©, it's time I cut you in on the secret to success. Any guesses?
",108,53,3,21,Calculon,Fry11439,Fry," Uh, work really, really hard?
",31,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11440,Steve Castle," No.
",5,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11441,Fry," Oh, thank God!
",16,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11442,Steve Castle," It's all about appearances. That's why it's time to update our company's stodgy image and give it the sleek, dazzling veneer of the 1980's!
",141,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11443,Fry," This company's on the fast track to the ""It"" list. Blast back kudos all around!
",81,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Leela11444,Leela," Uh, hello? We haven't made one delivery since you two took over.
",66,53,3,21,Fry,Steve Castle11445,Steve Castle," Delivery has nothing to do with the delivery business. Image, people, image! Scope out this new ad!
",101,53,3,21,Leela,Mom11446,Mom,"  We are all one, with one mind, one purpose and one act. Our enemies shall be eaten by squirrels.  We shall bow down and worship to ourselves.  We shall prevail!
",163,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Man #111447,Man #1,"  Hey! We were watching that!
",30,53,3,21,Mom,Leela11448,Leela," That was terrible! People won't even know what we do.
",55,53,3,21,Man #1,Bender11449,Bender," I don't even know what we do. Nah, just kidding! What are, like, a bus or something?
",86,53,3,21,Leela,Leela11450,Leela," Did you approve that awful ad, Fry?
",37,53,3,21,Bender,Fry11451,Fry," Yes I did, Leels. And I'll tell you why. Because it grows the brand.
",70,53,3,21,Leela,Leela11452,Leela," Oh, Lord!
",11,53,3,21,Fry,Zoidberg11453,Zoidberg," This company's circling the drain, I tell you. I'd sell my stock right now for a sandwich!
",92,53,3,21,Leela,Steve Castle11454,Steve Castle," Sold!
",7,53,3,21,Zoidberg,Zoidberg11455,Zoidberg," A complete sangwich?  You got fleeced! I would have settled for a hard roll with ketchup inside!
",98,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Mom11456,Mom," What is this moose drip?   The new delivery kings?  I'm sick of hearing about those turtle squirts!
",101,53,3,21,Zoidberg,Igner11457,Igner," But they're kings, Mommy!
",27,53,3,21,Mom,Mom11458,Mom," Jam a bastard in it, you crap!
",32,53,3,21,Igner,Elzar11459,Elzar," Enjoy our private dining room, folks. This is where we serve our richest, most successful chumps!
",99,53,3,21,Mom,Fry11460,Fry," Tonight, that's us!
",21,53,3,21,Elzar,Steve Castle11461,Steve Castle," What have you got that's really overpriced?
",45,53,3,21,Fry,Elzar11462,Elzar," Everything.
",13,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11463,Steve Castle," Bring me that.
",16,53,3,21,Elzar,Fry11464,Fry," Make it two. And a glass of all your water.
",45,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11465,Steve Castle," OK, let's work on your execu-speak. I'm worried about ""blank"".
",64,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11466,Fry," Don't you worry about ""blank"". Let me worry about ""blank"".
",60,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11467,Steve Castle," Good. I also would have accepted, ""Blank? Blank? You're not looking at the big picture!""
",90,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11468,Fry,"  What a pleasant surprise!
",28,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Mom11469,Mom," Shut up, booger blaster! It's time the three of us had a talk.
",64,53,3,21,Fry,Steve Castle11470,Steve Castle," I'll handle this, Fry. You get back to the farm, shift some paradigms, revolutionise outside the box.
",103,53,3,21,Mom,Fry11471,Fry," I'm on it. But if you need me, you know where I'll be.
",56,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Fry11472,Fry,"  Call me a ""booger blaster""! I'll blast a booger so hard that--
",65,53,3,21,Fry,Leela11473,Leela," Fry, we're worried about Planet Express.
",42,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11474,Fry," Don't you worry about Planet Express. Let me worry about ""blank"".
",67,53,3,21,Leela,Hermes11475,Hermes," That Guy is nothing but a flashy con man! And you've been hypnotised by his swinging baloney!
",95,53,3,21,Fry,Leela11476,Leela," You've changed, Fry.
",22,53,3,21,Hermes,Fry11477,Fry," What? I haven't changed.  Suz? Have I changed?
",48,53,3,21,Leela,Suz11478,Suz,"  No, sir, Mr. Fry.
",20,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11479,Fry," Thanks, doll.
",15,53,3,21,Suz,Leela11480,Leela," I don't care what Ms. Johnson says. That Guy's turning this place into some kind of business.
",95,53,3,21,Fry,Farnsworth11481,Farnsworth," This isn't a business. I've always thought of it more as a source of cheap labour, like a family.
",99,53,3,21,Leela,Fry11482,Fry," You're right, Professor. We might not be a traditional family like the Murphy's next door or the lesbian coven across the street. But we are a family and That Guy understands that.
",182,53,3,21,Farnsworth,Steve Castle11483,Steve Castle,"  Everyone's fired and we're out of business.
",46,53,3,21,Fry,Amy11484,Amy," Oh, no!
",9,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Hermes11485,Hermes," How?
",6,53,3,21,Amy,Steve Castle11486,Steve Castle,"  I'm gonna sell Planet Express to Mom so she can gut the company and eliminate us as competitors.
",99,53,3,21,Hermes,Mom11487,Mom,"  Don't let the door hit you on the way out, 'cause I don't want ass prints on my new door!
",92,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Fry11488,Fry," Uh, Ms. Johnson? Please bring in some more chair fuel.
",56,53,3,21,Mom,Fry11489,Fry," I had no idea the company would be sold. I was just an innocent suck-up. You've gotta believe me!
",99,53,3,21,Fry,Leela11490,Leela," Just leave us alone and let us clear out our lockers.
",55,53,3,21,Fry,Bender11491,Bender," Yeah!
",7,53,3,21,Leela,Amy11492,Amy,"  It's so sad, where will I go? What will I do?
",48,53,3,21,Bender,Lackey11493,Lackey," You have Mrs. Darlinghaven's cotillion at 7, ma'am.
",53,53,3,21,Amy,Amy11494,Amy,"  Oh. That'll be fun.
",22,53,3,21,Lackey,Fry11495,Fry," Ms. Johnson, you've never lied to me. Am I still a good person?
",65,53,3,21,Amy,Suz11496,Suz,"  I don't know, sir. I'm a program built into the intercom.
",60,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11497,Fry," I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, sometime, for some reason. I'll block this takeover!
",90,53,3,21,Suz,Suz11498,Suz,"  Mr. Fry, your two o'clock magician is here.
",46,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11499,Fry," Believe it or not, I have more important things to do today than laugh and clap my hands.  Reschedule.
",104,53,3,21,Suz,Broker-bot #111500,Broker-bot #1,"  Sell 100 soylent beans!
",26,53,3,21,Fry,Broker-bot #211501,Broker-bot #2,"  Buy 3,000 cornbellies!

",27,53,3,21,Broker-bot #3,Jor-El11504,Jor-El," Attention, please. The takeover of PlanEx Corp. by Mom's Delivery Company will take place in the business centre in 10 minutes. I am Jor-El, master of scheduling!
",164,53,3,21,Broker-bot #1,Steve Castle11505,Steve Castle," OK. We've got the hot tub hot, the wine cooler's cool. It's Hammer time!
",74,53,3,21,Jor-El,Bender11506,Bender," You suck!
",11,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Mom11507,Mom," According to regulations, both companies must approve the takeover. Planet Express shareholders, cast your votes.
",115,53,3,21,Bender,Hermes11508,Hermes," Great Bonda of Uganda! We can vote against it!
",48,53,3,21,Mom,Bender11509,Bender," I'll vote it down like a raise for school teachers!
",53,53,3,21,Hermes,Bender11510,Bender," What the--?
",13,53,3,21,Bender,Hattie McDoogal11511,Hattie McDoogal," How the--?
",12,53,3,21,Bender,Amy11512,Amy," Oh, no!
",9,53,3,21,Hattie McDoogal,Steve Castle11513,Steve Castle," I neglected to mention that the shares I bought from Dr. Zoidberg gave me majority control.
",93,53,3,21,Amy,Leela11514,Leela," Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?
",36,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Hermes11515,Hermes," The shares were worthless and he kept asking for toilet paper.
",64,53,3,21,Leela,Mom11516,Mom," And now if Momcorp shareholders will cast their ballots.
",58,53,3,21,Hermes,Igner11517,Igner," Um ... uh...  Uh, the ballot was confusing.
",45,53,3,21,Mom,Mom11518,Mom," How about a hand recount?
",27,53,3,21,Igner,Igner11519,Igner," OK.  Ow!
",10,53,3,21,Mom,Mom11520,Mom," The takeover of Planet Express is approved.
",45,53,3,21,Igner,Amy11521,Amy," This stinks!
",14,53,3,21,Mom,Lackey11522,Lackey," Madam is outraged.
",20,53,3,21,Amy,Steve Castle11523,Steve Castle," Security, I want that bunch of rowdies outta here.
",52,53,3,21,Lackey,Bender11524,Bender," Hold on a minute!
",19,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Scruffy11525,Scruffy," Hey! Hey!
",11,53,3,21,Bender,Mom11526,Mom," Momcorp will now purchase all outstanding shares of Planet Express at the current market price, which is:
",107,53,3,21,Scruffy,Jor-El11527,Jor-El," 107.
",6,53,3,21,Mom,Bender11528,Bender," Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!
",35,53,3,21,Jor-El,Horrible Gelatinous Stockbroker11529,Horrible Gelatinous Stockbroker," What are you solids griping about? Your shares are worth $107 apiece.
",71,53,3,21,Bender,Leela11530,Leela," They are? Oh, my God! I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an opinion about that capital gains tax!
",99,53,3,21,Horrible Gelatinous Stockbroker,Bender11531,Bender," Yeah! Alright!
",16,53,3,21,Leela,Amy11532,Amy," I'm even richer!
",18,53,3,21,Bender,Zoidberg11533,Zoidberg," Oh! I have no shares!  Wait! My sangwich! Has it also appreciated in value?  Please, oh, please!
",98,53,3,21,Amy,Hermes11534,Hermes," You didn't even refrigerate it, you spineless lobster!
",56,53,3,21,Zoidberg,Zoidberg11535,Zoidberg," You had to drag spines into this!
",35,53,3,21,Hermes,Fry11536,Fry,"  As vice chairman of Planet Express, I'd like to say a few words. There comes a time for every man who becomes rich and deserts his friends, when he goes back how it was. For me, that time is now.
",198,53,3,21,Zoidberg,Fry11537,Fry," So I ask you, as a friend, won't you stop this deal?
",54,53,3,21,Fry,Steve Castle11538,Steve Castle," Fry, I'm an 80's guy. Friendship to me means that for two bucks I'd beat you with a pool cue till you got detached retinas. The deal will go ahead as--  My bones!
",164,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11539,Fry," Oh, my God! His boneitis!
",27,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Steve Castle11540,Steve Castle," I was so busy being an 80's guy, I forgot to cure it.  My only regret is ... that I have ... boneitis!
",104,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11541,Fry," He's dead.
",12,53,3,21,Steve Castle,Mom11542,Mom," Pry out his fillings, feed him to the jackals and let's get on with the sale.
",79,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11543,Fry," I don't think so. 'Cause, as vice chairman of the company, I gain voting control of his shares.
",97,53,3,21,Mom,Mom11544,Mom," Don't be a fool, you idiot!
",29,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11545,Fry," I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy was the greatest businessman that ever lived. And before his mysterious death, he taught me everything he knew.  But some things I had to learn myself.  I learned that money is fine but in the end what counts is people ...  ... people you love.  You can't put a price on that.  So I'm giving up control of the company ...  ... to a man of enormous experience ...  ... Professor ...  ... Hubert Farnsworth.
",445,53,3,21,Mom,Farnsworth11546,Farnsworth," Oh, uh, what? I'm awake, I'm awake!
",37,53,3,21,Fry,Bender11547,Bender," Fry! Stop doing the right thing, you jerk!
",44,53,3,21,Farnsworth,Leela11548,Leela," Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna be filthy, stinking rich!
",65,53,3,21,Bender,Zoidberg11549,Zoidberg," Trust me, two out of three doesn't cut it!
",44,53,3,21,Leela,Fry11550,Fry," You mean you'd rather be rich than work together?
",51,53,3,21,Zoidberg,Leela11551,Leela," Hell, yeah!
",13,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11552,Fry," In my whole life, this company was the only place I'd ever really felt at home. If being millionaires is more important to you than our--
",139,53,3,21,Leela,Bender11553,Bender," It is!
",8,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11554,Fry," Friendship, then I'll sell Planet Express, for you.
",53,53,3,21,Bender,Hattie McDoogal11555,Hattie McDoogal," ""Millionaires"" nothing! The stock's only worth three kajiggers!
",65,53,3,21,Fry,Bender11556,Bender," Oh, come on!
",14,53,3,21,Hattie McDoogal,Hermes11557,Hermes," My Jah! It's worth less now than when it was worthless!
",57,53,3,21,Bender,Fry11558,Fry," It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what I do! The deal is off!
",64,53,3,21,Hermes,Zoidberg11559,Zoidberg," Aha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor!  Oh! I'm ruined.  Why? Why?
",121,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11560,Fry," Look, so we're not millionaires. At least we all still get to work together.
",78,53,3,21,Zoidberg,Bender11561,Bender," Shut your fat mouth!
",22,53,3,21,Fry,Fry11562,Fry,"  See you guys Monday!
",23,53,3,21,Bender,Morbo11563,Morbo,"  Welcome back. Our next guest has been teaching the world to cook for over 20 years. But apparently my, uh, wife hasn't been listening.
",137,54,3,22,Fry,Linda11564,Linda,"  Oh, funny!
",13,54,3,22,Morbo,Morbo11565,Morbo,"  I will destroy her!  And now, extend a formulaic greeting to master chef Elzar.  So, uh, Elzar, what will you be cooking for Morbo to devour with his mighty jaws?
",165,54,3,22,Linda,Elzar11566,Elzar,"  Morbo, I'm gonna whip you up a nice, unnameable horror from beyond, with mango chutney.
",90,54,3,22,Morbo,Morbo11567,Morbo,"  Pathetic humans, prepare to write down the recipe!
",53,54,3,22,Elzar,Fry11568,Fry," Hey, uh, what's with all the pots and pans? You building a wife?
",66,54,3,22,Morbo,Bender11569,Bender," Part of one. Meantime, I'm cooking up a tasty Sunday brunch for my best friends.
",82,54,3,22,Fry,Fry11570,Fry," Brunch. Right. I'd better warn-- tell-- warntell the others!
",62,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11571,Bender," Okey-dokey!
",13,54,3,22,Fry,Hermes11572,Hermes," Ooh!
",6,54,3,22,Bender,Leela11573,Leela," Nice!
",7,54,3,22,Hermes,Farnsworth11574,Farnsworth," Yes, it's a perfect scale model of the universe's largest bottle. I put a tiny spaceship inside to keep it from being boring.
",127,54,3,22,Leela,Zoidberg11575,Zoidberg," Oh!
",5,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11576,Farnsworth," Get--!  For the last time, Zoidberg, look with your eyes, not with your claws.
",80,54,3,22,Zoidberg,Fry11577,Fry," Brace yourselves. Bender is making us brunch.
",47,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Zoidberg11578,Zoidberg," Oh, boy!
",10,54,3,22,Fry,Farnsworth11579,Farnsworth," Oh, God! My tract!
",20,54,3,22,Zoidberg,Fry11580,Fry," He's so proud of his awful cooking. If we don't eat it he'll be crushed.
",74,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Leela11581,Leela," Alright, don't panic. If we can get to the ship, we can fly north and hide under the polar icecaps for a few weeks.
",117,54,3,22,Fry,Fry11582,Fry," Hurry!
",8,54,3,22,Leela,Farnsworth11583,Farnsworth," Good idea!
",12,54,3,22,Fry,Zoidberg11584,Zoidberg," What's the hold-up?
",21,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Bender11585,Bender," Fleeing somewhere?
",20,54,3,22,Zoidberg,Fry11586,Fry," With you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly.
",58,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11587,Bender," In that case brunch is served! Let's go! Move it out! Stop crying, Leela!
",75,54,3,22,Fry,Farnsworth11588,Farnsworth," Zoidberg, are you coming?
",27,54,3,22,Bender,Zoidberg11589,Zoidberg," Sure. Me.
",11,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11590,Farnsworth," Because I don't want you touching that thing.
",47,54,3,22,Zoidberg,Zoidberg11591,Zoidberg," I know that.  Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg!  Oh, no! Professor will hit me. But if Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts!  Ow! What? Oh!
",146,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Bender11592,Bender," Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I baked you a pony.  Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove.
",153,54,3,22,Zoidberg,Hermes11593,Hermes," This is terrible!
",19,54,3,22,Bender,Farnsworth11594,Farnsworth," Good thing I secretly installed this wormhole in the table.
",61,54,3,22,Hermes,Amy11595,Amy," Where does the other end come out?
",36,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11596,Farnsworth," You know, I'm not quite sure.  Oh, dear me!
",45,54,3,22,Amy,Bender11597,Bender," The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things, right?
",58,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Zoidberg11598,Zoidberg," Casual hello. It's me, Zoidberg. Act naturally.  Ow! Ouch! Get off of me! Stop!
",81,54,3,22,Bender,Leela11599,Leela," How interesting, Dr. Zoidberg. Do go on.
",42,54,3,22,Zoidberg,Bender11600,Bender," Hey, check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's that for a coincidence, Professor? With all your precious science!
",142,54,3,22,Leela,Fry11601,Fry,"  Man, I don't wanna hurt Bender's feelings...
",47,54,3,22,Bender,Fry11602,Fry," But this food actually tastes better as vomit!
",48,54,3,22,Fry,Leela11603,Leela," It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to get my tongue removed?
",80,54,3,22,Fry,Bender11604,Bender,"  And this time I mean it.
",27,54,3,22,Leela,Bender11605,Bender," Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. I don't have what it takes and nothing can change that.  Then it's settled! Elzar will teach me to cook!
",182,54,3,22,Bender,Elzar11606,Elzar," Absolutely not.
",17,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11607,Bender," But I watch your show. You owe me!
",36,54,3,22,Elzar,Elzar11608,Elzar," I owe you nothing! For starter's, your antenna's in my crotch. Also, I hate you. Finally, you can't cook for squat.
",117,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11609,Bender," What was the first one again?
",31,54,3,22,Elzar,Elzar11610,Elzar," I hate you.
",13,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11611,Bender," I thought that was number two.
",32,54,3,22,Elzar,Elzar11612,Elzar," I knocked it up a notch. Bam!
",31,54,3,22,Bender,Zoidberg11613,Zoidberg," Aw, I'll never recombobulate this ship! When the Professor finds out, he'll tear me a new cloaca.  Wait! What would the robot do?  Frame someone!
",147,54,3,22,Elzar,Fry11614,Fry," What up?
",10,54,3,22,Zoidberg,Fry11615,Fry,"  I'm walking on sunshine!  Sunshine!
",38,54,3,22,Fry,Bender11616,Bender,"  It's over! My dream of being a chef is deader than the cat I'm sitting on!
",77,54,3,22,Fry,Dandy Jim11617,Dandy Jim," Gus, old chum, let's give a friendly welcome to this new robo.
",64,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11618,Bender," What did you call me?
",23,54,3,22,Dandy Jim,Gus11619,Gus," A robo. You know? A robot-hobo.
",33,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11620,Bender," Oh, OK. I thought you said ""romo"".
",36,54,3,22,Gus,Dandy Jim11621,Dandy Jim," No offence intended, my filthy friend. In fact, why not join us and ride the space rails?
",91,54,3,22,Bender,Gus11622,Gus," Get ready. We's gonna jump off at that switching prism up ahead.
",66,54,3,22,Dandy Jim,Dandy Jim11623,Dandy Jim," We're going nearly the speed of light so, uh, roll when you land.
",67,54,3,22,Gus,Bender11624,Bender," Ow.
",5,54,3,22,Dandy Jim,Gus11625,Gus," Welcome to Bumbase Alpha, the biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant.
",68,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11626,Bender," I've seen bigger. Oh, wait, I'm thinking of Eugene, Oregon.  Wait. A pie with hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?
",113,54,3,22,Gus,Gus11627,Gus," Helmut Spargle. He used to be the greatest chef ever.
",55,54,3,22,Bender,Dandy Jim11628,Dandy Jim," His restaurant was so high-toned, the only way to get reservations was to create a parallel universe where you already had reservations.
",138,54,3,22,Gus,Gus11629,Gus," Yep. I once ate there back when I what was a senator.
",55,54,3,22,Dandy Jim,Bender11630,Bender," Yo, Spargle. If you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?
",74,54,3,22,Gus,Spargle11631,Spargle," Ages ago I was the host of a TV show...
",41,54,3,22,Bender,Spargle11632,Spargle,"  Down Home Country Kitchen Mit Helmut Spargle. But one day the extreme soda company that sponsored the show decided it was too old-fashioned.
",143,54,3,22,Spargle,Man #111633,Man #1," Spargle, you're fired! We need a chef who can attract today's younger more extreme cooking show viewer.
",105,54,3,22,Spargle,Spargle11634,Spargle," Elzar!
",8,54,3,22,Man #1,Elzar11635,Elzar," Get lost, old man! Bam!
",25,54,3,22,Spargle,Spargle11636,Spargle," Mein soufflÃ©!
",15,54,3,22,Elzar,Spargle11637,Spargle," Elzar had been seduced by the dark side of cooking. Cilantro, mango salsa, raspberry vinaigrette!
",99,54,3,22,Spargle,Bender11638,Bender," That twizzler!
",16,54,3,22,Spargle,Spargle11639,Spargle," As for me, I went temporarily insane and vound up here, making pies out of shoes.
",83,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11640,Bender," My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves robots. That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too.
",131,54,3,22,Spargle,Spargle11641,Spargle," Interesting. You wish to become a cook, but as a robot you have no sense of taste.
",84,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11642,Bender," It's so unfair! I have eight other senses, but I'd trade them all, even smission, to be able to taste.
",104,54,3,22,Spargle,Spargle11643,Spargle," You don't understand. Without the distraction of taste, your mind is free to touch the Zen of pure flavour. You could become the greatest chef ever.
",150,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11644,Bender," I could?
",10,54,3,22,Spargle,Spargle11645,Spargle," Yes. Just as Beethoven was a great composer because he was deaf.
",66,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11646,Bender," Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands.
",55,54,3,22,Spargle,Spargle11647,Spargle," Bender, hear me well. I shall train you. But first, you must forget everything you know about cooking.
",104,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11648,Bender," Done.
",7,54,3,22,Spargle,Farnsworth11649,Farnsworth," That's right, Ricardo. A ship in a bottle! What's that? Well hang on, I'll look.
",82,54,3,22,Bender,Ricardo11650,Ricardo,"  Ola? Professor? QuÃ© pasa?
",28,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11651,Farnsworth," I've gathered you all here in the accusing parlour because one of you is a miniature ship wrecker.
",100,54,3,22,Ricardo,Zoidberg11652,Zoidberg," I'm acting astonished.
",24,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11653,Farnsworth," Certain clues suggest that the culprit is none other than our own ... Philip J. Fry!
",86,54,3,22,Zoidberg,Fry11654,Fry," What?
",7,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11655,Farnsworth," Oh, it was a brilliant scheme. But you made one fatal mistake ... leaving this confession note.
",97,54,3,22,Fry,Zoidberg11656,Zoidberg," Fry, you scoundrel!
",21,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Fry11657,Fry," Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself.
",87,54,3,22,Zoidberg,Farnsworth11658,Farnsworth," Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials: $10.
",78,54,3,22,Fry,Fry11659,Fry," There you go.
",15,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Zoidberg11660,Zoidberg,"  What have I done?
",20,54,3,22,Fry,Spargle11661,Spargle," Your training is complete, little dessert spoon. Now, just as the man who wishes to be world chess champion must win at least one game of chess, so must you serve at least one edible meal.  Succeed and I shall reveal to you the age-old secret  of perfect flavour.
",265,54,3,22,Zoidberg,Gus11662,Gus," Ooh, yeah!
",12,54,3,22,Spargle,Bender11663,Bender,"  Slop's on!
",13,54,3,22,Gus,Gus11664,Gus," Fine lookin' eats!
",20,54,3,22,Bender,Spargle11665,Spargle," It is ... acceptable.
",23,54,3,22,Gus,Bender11666,Bender," Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. Why'd you stop eating, master?
",73,54,3,22,Spargle,Spargle11667,Spargle,"  Because ... my stomach is about to explode.
",46,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11668,Bender," What? My dinner killed you? Oh, man!
",38,54,3,22,Spargle,Spargle11669,Spargle,"  Oh, it hurts. But don't lose confidence. The important thing is that you defeat Elzar after I am gone.  And using this, you cannot fail.
",139,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11670,Bender," A diamond vial of Mrs. Dash?
",30,54,3,22,Spargle,Spargle11671,Spargle,"  No. It is the essence of pure flavour. A few drops will cause the inner perfection of any dish to blossom forth.  Oh! There goes my ... life.
",144,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11672,Bender," I'll avenge you, master. I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums, that I shall defeat Elzar!
",101,54,3,22,Spargle,Gus11673,Gus," Oh, I'm not drunk, I'm mentally ill. But I likes what what you said!
",70,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11674,Bender," Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business!
",56,54,3,22,Gus,Elzar11675,Elzar," Why, you--
",12,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11676,Bender," Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says  ""Ooh, I'm dead!""
",65,54,3,22,Elzar,Elzar11677,Elzar," Spargle, huh? What he do, bland himself to death?
",51,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11678,Bender," No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. Now I'm here to avenge him.
",113,54,3,22,Elzar,Elzar11679,Elzar," OK, but it seems like you're the one who killed him.
",54,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11680,Bender," Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of the chefs.
",81,54,3,22,Elzar,Customer11681,Customer," Scandalous!
",13,54,3,22,Bender,Elzar11682,Elzar," Very well. We'll meet on the ancient televised battleground of Kitchen Coliseum. Whosever meal is best will claim the title of Iron Cook.
",139,54,3,22,Customer,Bender11683,Bender," Iron Cook, eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% iron!  You're going down! Uh, also I had a reservation for one, under ""Dr. Bender"".
",122,54,3,22,Elzar,Hiroki11684,Hiroki," Please welcome the superintendent of Kitchen Coliseum, Chairman Koji!  No robot chef has ever competed here but today one has barged his way in to challenge for the title of...
",178,54,3,22,Bender,Koji11685,Koji," Iron Cookuru!
",15,54,3,22,Hiroki,Fry11686,Fry,"  Yeah! You show 'em!
",22,54,3,22,Koji,Hiroki11687,Hiroki," Let's meet today's celebrity judges: Captain of the Harlem Globetrotters, Ethan Bubblegum Tate.
",97,54,3,22,Fry,Tate11688,Tate," Konnichiwa, brother!
",22,54,3,22,Hiroki,Hiroki11689,Hiroki," TV anchor-monster, Morbo.
",27,54,3,22,Tate,Morbo11690,Morbo," Greetings, pathetic host.
",27,54,3,22,Hiroki,Hiroki11691,Hiroki," And a woman who ended a thousand-year galactic war with her apple dandies, Martha Stewart's head.
",99,54,3,22,Morbo,Stewart11692,Stewart," The secret is fresh pork.
",27,54,3,22,Hiroki,Hiroki11693,Hiroki," And now, Chairman Koji will present the theme ingredient to be used in every dish today.
",90,54,3,22,Stewart,Bender11694,Bender,"  If it's chicken, chicken c la king; if it's fish, fish Ã  la king; if it's turkey, fish Ã  la king.
",100,54,3,22,Hiroki,Koji11695,Koji," Soylent Greuu!
",16,54,3,22,Bender,Hiroki11696,Hiroki," Soylent Green, a classic ingredient of gourmet cooking. And the battle is on.  Aki, what's Elzar making?
",106,54,3,22,Koji,Aki11697,Aki," Well, Hiroki-san, when I asked him, he asked what business it was of mine and conjectured that my mother was a prostitute.
",124,54,3,22,Hiroki,Stewart11698,Stewart," In the English countryside many prostitutes decorate their rooms with festive gourds.
",87,54,3,22,Aki,Female Announcer #111699,Female Announcer #1,"  30 minutes to go.
",20,54,3,22,Stewart,Hiroki11700,Hiroki," Look at Bender roll that dough!
",33,54,3,22,Female Announcer #1,Tate11701,Tate," I've never seen such confident, powerful strokes of the ass!
",62,54,3,22,Hiroki,Stewart11702,Stewart," You've never seen mine!
",25,54,3,22,Tate,Tate11703,Tate,"  No, I haven't!
",17,54,3,22,Stewart,Female Announcer #111704,Female Announcer #1,"  Fifteen minutes remaining.
",29,54,3,22,Tate,Hiroki11705,Hiroki," The iron cook is bringing in his signature creation, a working pastry replica of downtown Venice.
",99,54,3,22,Female Announcer #1,Man #111706,Man #1,"  Commemorative turkey basters. Get your commemorative turkey basters.
",71,54,3,22,Hiroki,Fry11707,Fry," Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and I've tried everything.  Oh, right. Never mind.
",85,54,3,22,Man #1,Zoidberg11708,Zoidberg," Oh, the guilt! The unbearable guilt!
",38,54,3,22,Fry,Female Announcer #111709,Female Announcer #1,"  Fifteen seconds.
",19,54,3,22,Zoidberg,Elzar11710,Elzar," Bam!
",6,54,3,22,Female Announcer #1,Female Announcer #111711,Female Announcer #1,"  Ten seconds.
",15,54,3,22,Elzar,Bender11712,Bender," Master Spargle, if you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you, this is for you.
",94,54,3,22,Female Announcer #1,Koji11713,Koji," Time uperuu!
",14,54,3,22,Bender,Hiroki11714,Hiroki," The iron cook Neptunian has gone all out to please the judges. He's even garnished the salad with $100 bills. Let's see what they think.
",138,54,3,22,Koji,Tate11715,Tate," Mmm. Soylent green is my kind of people!
",42,54,3,22,Hiroki,Morbo11716,Morbo," Scrumptious. Morbo will store this in his sack for future digestion.
",70,54,3,22,Tate,Stewart11717,Stewart," I'm swimming in my own soylent waste. It's a good thing.
",58,54,3,22,Morbo,Hiroki11718,Hiroki," Next up, challenger Bender. A student of the legendary Helmut Spargle, Bender is some sort of wonderful mechanical man.
",121,54,3,22,Stewart,Stewart11719,Stewart," Ooh, delicious!
",17,54,3,22,Hiroki,Tate11720,Tate," This food looks kind of funky, but it tastes kind of fun-kay!
",63,54,3,22,Stewart,Morbo11721,Morbo," The challenger's ugly food has shown us that even hideous things can be sweet on the inside.
",94,54,3,22,Tate,Hiroki11722,Hiroki," And now, judgement. The winner will become the new iron cook, the loser is doomed to scrub.  Whose confection will achieve perfection? Whose foodstuff will be the good stuff?
",176,54,3,22,Morbo,Koji11723,Koji," Challengeruu Benderuu!
",24,54,3,22,Hiroki,Fry11724,Fry," Yay!
",6,54,3,22,Koji,Farnsworth11725,Farnsworth,"  That's my robot! I own him!
",30,54,3,22,Fry,Bender11726,Bender," You honour me, Chairman Koji.
",31,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Koji11727,Koji," Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.
",27,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11728,Bender," Chairman-san, I came here with one goal: To humiliate Elzar in a large stadium. I believe I've done that.
",107,54,3,22,Koji,Elzar11729,Elzar," No question.
",14,54,3,22,Bender,Bender11730,Bender," But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen, with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser title of ""Zinc Saucier"", which I just made up. Also, it comes with double prize money.
",262,54,3,22,Elzar,Zoidberg11731,Zoidberg," Wait! Everyone must know: I broke the Professor's bottled ship.  And what is worse, I framed my dearest friend, Fry!  I can never repay him his ten dollars, so I must take the only honourable path. What the killing myself.  Here I go, already.  Huh?
",251,54,3,22,Bender,Koji11732,Koji," Oh! That sword cost 5000 dolluu!
",34,54,3,22,Zoidberg,Zoidberg11733,Zoidberg," Fry did it!
",13,54,3,22,Koji,Bender11734,Bender," And that's how I defeated Elzar, thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.
",68,54,3,22,Zoidberg,Leela11735,Leela," Yes, we were there. And we just finished watching it again on TV.
",67,54,3,22,Bender,Farnsworth11736,Farnsworth," Hmm. Let me see that vial, Bender.  Good Lord! According to the spectrolizer, Spargle's magic ingredient was ... water. Ordinary water!
",137,54,3,22,Leela,Hermes11737,Hermes," No!
",5,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Fry11738,Fry," Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence. The confidence to be your best.
",87,54,3,22,Hermes,Farnsworth11739,Farnsworth," Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.
",75,54,3,22,Fry,Bender11740,Bender," The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch? Cooked with plenty of ... ""confidence""?
",128,54,3,22,Farnsworth,Leela11741,Leela," I'm in!
",9,54,3,22,Bender,Farnsworth11742,Farnsworth," I do!
",7,54,3,22,Leela,Amy11743,Amy," Shman! The Great Rad Spot is mega-sweet for party-boarding.
",61,55,4,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11744,Farnsworth," Indeed.
",9,55,4,1,Amy,Amy11745,Amy," Any calls while I was out?
",28,55,4,1,Farnsworth,Leela11746,Leela," Yeah. You got a tele-sonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago.
",70,55,4,1,Amy,Amy11747,Amy," My Kiffie called?  Kif?
",25,55,4,1,Leela,Kif11748,Kif,"  Ooh, Amy, you're back. Another hour and I would have thought about hanging up.
",81,55,4,1,Amy,Amy11749,Amy," Why didn't you just leave a message, sweetie?
",47,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11750,Kif,"  Well, um, I've left hundreds of messages with your answering machine but you never seem to get them.
",103,55,4,1,Amy,Amy11751,Amy,"  Bender!
",10,55,4,1,Kif,Bender11752,Bender," Not my fault if you don't check me!  Messages erased.
",55,55,4,1,Amy,Kif11753,Kif,"  Oh, dearest, this long-distance relationship is too much to bear.  When even an inch separates us, I quiver with misery. So you can imagine how I feel when it's a billion light years.
",186,55,4,1,Bender,Amy11754,Amy,"  Kif, don't cry, or you'll get a tummy ache.
",46,55,4,1,Kif,Zapp11755,Zapp,"  Lieutenant, some things came off me and clogged the drain, so if you could-- Oh, ho! What's this?
",100,55,4,1,Amy,Zapp11756,Zapp," Well, well, well! Do my eyes believe me or is that my bosom-y swan, Leela?
",76,55,4,1,Zapp,Leela11757,Leela,"  Say again. You're breaking up!
",33,55,4,1,Zapp,Farnsworth11758,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! You'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind of Nigel 7.
",86,55,4,1,Leela,Scruffy11759,Scruffy," Scruffy's rollin' out a large pill!
",37,55,4,1,Farnsworth,Amy11760,Amy," You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there. You could drop me off on the way.
",88,55,4,1,Scruffy,Farnsworth11761,Farnsworth," We could but we won't! It's a spaceship, damnit, not a prom limousine!  If anyone needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome.
",119,55,4,1,Amy,Leela11762,Leela," This is a very long trip. So we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis to save oxygen.
",93,55,4,1,Farnsworth,Bender11763,Bender,"  I don't even breathe oxygen!
",31,55,4,1,Leela,Amy11764,Amy,"  Here I come, Kif!
",20,55,4,1,Bender,Zapp11765,Zapp," They jumped right out of their pants!  Oh, what now? Activate glass window.  Kif, I'm sensing a very sensual disturbance in the force. Prepare for ship-to-ship intimacy!
",171,55,4,1,Amy,Kif11766,Kif," Yes, sir, captain!
",20,55,4,1,Zapp,Zapp11767,Zapp," How 'bout I help you finish that dream you were having about me?
",66,55,4,1,Kif,Leela11768,Leela," OK. I was just at this part: Yah!
",35,55,4,1,Zapp,Zapp11769,Zapp," Uh, let's try that a little lower and a lot softer!
",53,55,4,1,Leela,Kif11770,Kif," Imagine you stowing away and stealing a licensed starship! Oh, it's so romantic it gives me the shivers!
",106,55,4,1,Zapp,Amy11771,Amy," I don't care how much trouble I get in. I needed to feel my lips pressed against your lipless beak.
",101,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11772,Kif," Oh, Amy, I can't stand having a whole universe between us. I've been thinking a lot about this and, well, would you move in with me?
",134,55,4,1,Amy,Amy11773,Amy," Here? But, uh, wouldn't it be crowded?
",40,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11774,Kif," No, no! It's really twice the size. You can use the floor and I'll have the ceiling. See?
",91,55,4,1,Amy,Amy11775,Amy," Kif! You have so much creativity and niceness, but I'm not ...  ... sure if I--
",81,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11776,Kif," Hush! Before you answer, come thither.
",40,55,4,1,Amy,Kif11777,Kif," This is the Holo-Shed. It can simulate anything you desire, and nothing can hurt you. Except when it malfunctions and the holograms become real.
",146,55,4,1,Kif,Amy11778,Amy," Well, that probably won't happen this time.
",45,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11779,Kif," I wanted to show you what life would be like if we were together. Computer: Run program ""Kif 1"".
",98,55,4,1,Amy,Amy11780,Amy," This is so beautiful!  Spirit! Kif, that's the pony I always wanted but my parents said I had too many ponies already.
",120,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11781,Kif," Yes, I programmed it in for you. 4 million lines of BASIC! And if this isn't the life you want, how 'bout this? Run program ""Kif 2"".
",134,55,4,1,Amy,Amy11782,Amy," Oh, Kif!
",10,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11783,Kif," We could live here at the shore of the Tranquilibrius Sea in a timeshare. And I would pluck the moon from the sky just to see you smile.  Almost got it. It seems to be ... sort of ... stuck!  I love you!  Run program ""Kif://3"".
",229,55,4,1,Amy,Amy11784,Amy," This isn't bad. My aunt had a place like this.
",48,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11785,Kif," Amy, we could live in a bus station bathroom for all I care. As long as we're together, it'll feel like a castle to me.
",121,55,4,1,Amy,Amy11786,Amy," Kif, I'd love to live with you ... someday. But before then there's still lots I wanna do on my own.  What was that?
",118,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11787,Kif," Oh, dear. I fear the Holo-Shed might be broken again. Well, as long as we don't cross paths with Attila the--
",111,55,4,1,Amy,Amy11788,Amy," Look! Spirit!
",15,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11789,Kif," And there's Professor Moriarty, Jack the Ripper, Evil Lincoln!
",64,55,4,1,Amy,Moriarty11790,Moriarty," Right-oh, gents, it's another simulation gone mad, so murder and mayhem, standard procedure!
",94,55,4,1,Kif,Jack the Ripper11791,Jack the Ripper," Rampage!
",10,55,4,1,Moriarty,Evil Lincoln11792,Evil Lincoln,"  Real holographic-simulated Evil Lincoln is back!
",51,55,4,1,Jack the Ripper,Kif11793,Kif," The Holo-Shed's on the fritz again! The characters turned real!
",65,55,4,1,Evil Lincoln,Zapp11794,Zapp," Damn. The last time that happened I got slapped with three paternity suits.  Listen up, history's greatest villains...  Get back into the Holo-Shed before I start blasting!
",174,55,4,1,Kif,Attila the Hun11795,Attila the Hun," Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
",77,55,4,1,Zapp,Zapp11796,Zapp," Spare me your space-age techno-babble, Attila the Hun!
",56,55,4,1,Attila the Hun,Bender11797,Bender," Hey!
",6,55,4,1,Zapp,Amy11798,Amy," Kif! Hold on!
",15,55,4,1,Bender,Kif11799,Kif," I totally want to!
",20,55,4,1,Amy,Leela11800,Leela," Grab on!
",10,55,4,1,Kif,Fry11801,Fry," Over here!
",12,55,4,1,Leela,Kif11802,Kif," Please hold me!
",17,55,4,1,Fry,Bender11803,Bender," Have a good one!  Oh, man!
",28,55,4,1,Kif,Zapp11804,Zapp," After all that I could use some relaxation. I'll be in the Holo-Shed.
",71,55,4,1,Bender,McGee11805,McGee," Well, except for a few broken bones, some internal haemorrhaging and a partially barfed-up heart, everyone appears fine.  Oh, and Kif is pregnant.
",148,55,4,1,Zapp,Kif11806,Kif," Oh, joy!
",10,55,4,1,McGee,Kif11807,Kif," Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant!
",40,55,4,1,Kif,Amy11808,Amy," Yes it's ... great. A great miracle.
",38,55,4,1,Kif,Leela11809,Leela," And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?
",81,55,4,1,Amy,Bender11810,Bender," Yeah, what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, it's something else! Lemme at 'im!  Come over here, Kif! You--
",149,55,4,1,Leela,Zapp11811,Zapp," Look, I'm sure we're all a little unclear on how anyone gets pregnant. So, Kif, pray explain. And don't spare the dirty words where appropriate.
",146,55,4,1,Bender,Kif11812,Kif," Well, it's quite simple really. When one of my species experiences deep feelings of love we enter a so-called ""receptive state"".
",130,55,4,1,Zapp,Zapp11813,Zapp," You disgust me! Go on.
",24,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11814,Kif," At that point, our skin becomes a semi-permeable membrane, which allows the passage of genetic material. I held Amy's hand and voilÃ .
",135,55,4,1,Zapp,Bender11815,Bender," Well, OK. But that better be all there is!
",44,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11816,Kif," Oh, Amy! You'll be a mother!
",30,55,4,1,Bender,Kif11817,Kif," What a wondrous affirmation of our love. And all from the touch of your hand.
",79,55,4,1,Kif,Fry11818,Fry," Dude, hold up. Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?
",60,55,4,1,Kif,Evil Lincoln11819,Evil Lincoln," Indeed.
",9,55,4,1,Fry,Fry11820,Fry," Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?
",68,55,4,1,Evil Lincoln,Amy11821,Amy," Hey, yeah! I mean ... what about that, Kif?
",45,55,4,1,Fry,Kif11822,Kif," Well, I suppose I might have gotten pregnant that way. Or even from a toilet seat. Though that's impossible since I have a private washroom.
",142,55,4,1,Amy,Zapp11823,Zapp," Ah, my home away from home. By the way, Kif, your flush seemed to be set on stun, not kill.
",93,55,4,1,Kif,Amy11824,Amy," Look, Kif, I probably am the mother. Although maybe I'm not. Of course, I hope I am. But just in case I'm not, maybe we should have a test.
",141,55,4,1,Zapp,Bender11825,Bender," A test! I demand a test!
",26,55,4,1,Amy,Farnsworth11826,Farnsworth," Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross-species genetic analyser. But I guess I showed myself! Subjects, please enter the chamber.  Now to take a DNA sample.  When I pull this switch, the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM, separating out everyone who isn't the mother-- Father-- Whatever!
",303,55,4,1,Bender,Bender11827,Bender," Faster! Faster!
",17,55,4,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11828,Farnsworth," Good. Fry's ejection indicates that he is not the man-mom.  Nor is Captain Brannigan.
",87,55,4,1,Bender,Kif11829,Kif," Oh, thank you, merciful God!
",30,55,4,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11830,Farnsworth," Zoidberg? What the hell were you doing in there?
",50,55,4,1,Kif,Zoidberg11831,Zoidberg," That's where I live. I have no home.
",38,55,4,1,Farnsworth,Kif11832,Kif," Amy? But that means--
",23,55,4,1,Zoidberg,Kif11833,Kif," Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand. That explains the poster in hygiene class: ""No Glove, No Love"".
",131,55,4,1,Kif,Leela11834,Leela," Wow, this is all so confusing.
",32,55,4,1,Kif,Zapp11835,Zapp," Leela! How could you? Our love has had to endure your constant hatred, and now this?  Stop testing our love!
",110,55,4,1,Leela,Kif11836,Kif," Please, Captain. I thank Leela for the DNA she gave me but, in my species, the true parent is the one who inspired the initial feeling of love. We call that person the ""smizmar"". And my smizmar is Amy.
",203,55,4,1,Zapp,Zapp11837,Zapp," So the toilet seat is like the uncle or something?
",52,55,4,1,Kif,Leela11838,Leela," Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.
",38,55,4,1,Zapp,Amy11839,Amy," That's OK. At least Kif's baby shower should be fun. I'd better put it on my calendar.  Thursday: Baby shower, enter.  Might as well plan for my new life while I'm at it. Set ""Motherhood Mode"".
",195,55,4,1,Leela,Leela11840,Leela," To motherhood.
",16,55,4,1,Amy,Bender11841,Bender," Zoidberg?
",11,55,4,1,Leela,Fry11842,Fry," You know, my face was stuck in a pizza.
",41,55,4,1,Bender,Amy11843,Amy," Mom, Dad, I know this is weird but--
",38,55,4,1,Fry,Mrs. Wong11844,Mrs. Wong," Yeah, yeah. We don't care how squishy alien get pregnant. All we care is that we have grandchild now.
",103,55,4,1,Amy,Kif11845,Kif," You're very open-minded, Mrs. Wong.
",37,55,4,1,Mrs. Wong,Leo11846,Leo," Hey! You call her ""Grandma"" now!
",34,55,4,1,Kif,Mrs. Wong11847,Mrs. Wong," Call me Grandma like crazy! All the time!
",43,55,4,1,Leo,Fry11848,Fry," Check it out, y'all. Everyone we invited is here.
",51,55,4,1,Mrs. Wong,Zoidberg11849,Zoidberg," Also Zoidberg!
",16,55,4,1,Fry,Fry11850,Fry," So let's open the gifts.
",26,55,4,1,Zoidberg,Bender11851,Bender," Alright!
",10,55,4,1,Fry,Kif11852,Kif," I can't wait! Let's start with this one, from Bender.
",55,55,4,1,Bender,Bender11853,Bender," It's my booties from when I was a kid.
",40,55,4,1,Kif,Amy11854,Amy," Uh, they're already bronzed.
",30,55,4,1,Bender,Bender11855,Bender," They are bronze.
",18,55,4,1,Amy,Kif11856,Kif," And this one's from Leela. Oh, I just love the bow! I wonder what it is!
",74,55,4,1,Bender,Zapp11857,Zapp," Yes, I wonder what we got you.
",32,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11858,Kif," It's a basket! F-For picnics?
",31,55,4,1,Zapp,Leela11859,Leela," It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the orphanarium.
",81,55,4,1,Kif,Hermes11860,Hermes," You could use it for picnics.
",31,55,4,1,Leela,Mrs. Wong11861,Mrs. Wong," Here, Amy. We get this one for you.
",37,55,4,1,Hermes,Amy11862,Amy," Is it a new party board?
",26,55,4,1,Mrs. Wong,Mrs. Wong11863,Mrs. Wong," It's a board alright! An ironing board.
",41,55,4,1,Amy,Leo11864,Leo," We had your old party board converted now that you not be partying anymore.
",77,55,4,1,Mrs. Wong,Amy11865,Amy," You-You trashed my party board?
",33,55,4,1,Leo,Mrs. Wong11866,Mrs. Wong," Damn right! Now you're a mom, the only surfing you do is under a big wave of responsibility.
",94,55,4,1,Amy,Kif11867,Kif," Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life! You all brought such wonderful gifts. But the greatest gift--
",107,55,4,1,Mrs. Wong,Bender11868,Bender," Mine!
",7,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11869,Kif," Is the bond I share with my smizmar, Amy. For soon, the quivering mass of life within me will depend on us both.  Even now, I can sense it feeding, squirming, searching, questing. And shortly, it will rend my loins in twain, burst forth and pull us down, down, down into the deep, dark waters of commitment.
",309,55,4,1,Bender,Zoidberg11870,Zoidberg," That's so beautiful!
",22,55,4,1,Kif,Amy11871,Amy,"  Yes, it's, it's--  No! I can't do this!
",42,55,4,1,Zoidberg,Bender11872,Bender," Oh, my God!
",13,55,4,1,Amy,Kif11873,Kif," Oh, how could Amy leave me? When will women learn to take responsibility for the children they've helped create?  The quickening! My time is near. I must return to my homeworld to perform the ancient birthing rites.
",217,55,4,1,Bender,Scruffy11874,Scruffy," Lemme know how that turns out.
",32,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11875,Kif," I must now embark on a perilous journey to give birth in precisely the same swamp in which I was born.
",104,55,4,1,Scruffy,Leela11876,Leela," If it's so dangerous, I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA.
",77,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11877,Kif," No, Leela. Tradition demands that I make this journey with my smizmar. And since Amy isn't, here I must go it alone. Farewell, for we may never meet again.
",157,55,4,1,Leela,Kif11878,Kif," My scrapes feel a little better now.
",38,55,4,1,Kif,Bender11879,Bender," Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!
",65,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11880,Kif," It's a poisonous froad! No one move.
",38,55,4,1,Bender,Bender11881,Bender," I'm back, baby!
",17,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11882,Kif," Behold! The sacred ancestral birthing grounds of my family.
",61,55,4,1,Bender,Zapp11883,Zapp," Smells like a jockstrap!
",26,55,4,1,Kif,Grand Midwife11884,Grand Midwife," I am the Grand Midwife.
",25,55,4,1,Zapp,Fry11885,Fry," Hi!
",5,55,4,1,Grand Midwife,Kif11886,Kif," I am Kif, of the clan Kroker, come to bear my young.
",54,55,4,1,Fry,Grand Midwife11887,Grand Midwife," Then let the Tea of New Life be brewed.  As it is writ, ""and both shall lift the jug together"". Where is your smizmar?
",120,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11888,Kif," She's not with me.
",20,55,4,1,Grand Midwife,Grand Midwife11889,Grand Midwife," Oh, the sorrow. Oh, the shame. I'm sorry, I'm probably just making you feel worse.
",84,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11890,Kif," As long as Amy is with me in my heart I will have the strength of two.  Apparently Amy hasn't been working out much lately.
",125,55,4,1,Grand Midwife,Grand Midwife11891,Grand Midwife," As the tea boils, please join hands with your beloved smizmar.  Oh, right, sorry. But I memorised the ceremony by rote and it mentions her a lot.
",147,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11892,Kif," I'll try to endure.
",21,55,4,1,Grand Midwife,Grand Midwife11893,Grand Midwife," Good, 'cause I'm not changing it. Now turn ye to and gaze deeply into each other's eyes.
",90,55,4,1,Kif,Bender11894,Bender," What are you looking at?
",26,55,4,1,Grand Midwife,Grand Midwife11895,Grand Midwife," May the love I sense between you at this moment remain with you both through all your days.  The Tea of New Life is ready. Let those whose love created this life speak each other's names, then drink.
",201,55,4,1,Bender,Kif11896,Kif,"  Amy.
",7,55,4,1,Grand Midwife,Amy11897,Amy,"  Kif!
",7,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11898,Kif," Amy! Is it you or have I gone crazy with loneliness?
",54,55,4,1,Amy,Bender11899,Bender," Both.
",7,55,4,1,Kif,Amy11900,Amy," I still don't know if I'm ready for this but I do know I love you. And I wanna be here beside you.
",100,55,4,1,Bender,Grand Midwife11901,Grand Midwife," Great! Now I lost my place! I'm starting over!
",48,55,4,1,Amy,Kif11902,Kif," Oh, no time! It has begun!  Oh, my!
",37,55,4,1,Grand Midwife,Bender11903,Bender," Neat!
",7,55,4,1,Kif,Amy11904,Amy," You can do it, Kif!
",21,55,4,1,Bender,Kif11905,Kif," Whoa, Nellie!
",15,55,4,1,Amy,Bender11906,Bender," Oh, man!
",10,55,4,1,Kif,Kif11907,Kif," Amy, my love, tell me: Are they making it to the water?
",57,55,4,1,Bender,Leela11908,Leela," Amy!
",6,55,4,1,Kif,Amy11909,Amy," Shoo! Stay away from my babies!
",33,55,4,1,Leela,Grand Midwife11910,Grand Midwife," The birthing is complete!
",27,55,4,1,Amy,Bender11911,Bender," Alright!
",10,55,4,1,Grand Midwife,Kif11912,Kif," Oh, thank goodness!
",21,55,4,1,Bender,Grand Midwife11913,Grand Midwife," I will now take my leave. I live here so I won't actually be going anywhere, but you don't have to talk to me anymore.
",120,55,4,1,Kif,Fry11914,Fry," Congratulations!
",18,55,4,1,Grand Midwife,Zapp11915,Zapp," Nice work!
",12,55,4,1,Fry,Bender11916,Bender," Way to go, squishy!
",21,55,4,1,Zapp,Leela11917,Leela," There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.
",61,55,4,1,Bender,Fry11918,Fry," That's birth for you.
",23,55,4,1,Leela,Kif11919,Kif," Well, we've given them a great start, Amy. And in 20 years they'll sprout legs and crawl back onto land as children.
",118,55,4,1,Fry,Amy11920,Amy," I'll be ready then.
",21,55,4,1,Kif,Farnsworth11921,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up?
",72,56,4,2,Amy,Fry11922,Fry," Sure. We talk about it all the time.
",38,56,4,2,Farnsworth,Leela11923,Leela," Really?
",9,56,4,2,Fry,Fry11924,Fry," No. Burn!
",11,56,4,2,Leela,Farnsworth11925,Farnsworth," Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium has named Leela ""Orphan of the Year"".
",84,56,4,2,Fry,Amy11926,Amy," Yee-ha!
",9,56,4,2,Farnsworth,Bender11927,Bender," Alright!
",10,56,4,2,Amy,Amy11928,Amy," Your parents must be so proud. Oops! Sorry.
",45,56,4,2,Bender,Farnsworth11929,Farnsworth," And the good news keeps on coming. Behold my latest invention.
",64,56,4,2,Amy,Bender11930,Bender," Neat!
",7,56,4,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth11931,Farnsworth," Ta-da! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose you can wear over your regular non-glowing nose. Observe.
",95,56,4,2,Bender,Amy11932,Amy," Whoa, clool!
",14,56,4,2,Farnsworth,Bender11933,Bender," Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark.
",46,56,4,2,Amy,Bender11934,Bender,"  Where'd it go?
",17,56,4,2,Bender,Amy11935,Amy," Hey, Professor, what's all this scloop, glorking out of the machine?
",70,56,4,2,Bender,Farnsworth11936,Farnsworth," That? It's, uh ... nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything, you're a suspicious moron.
",98,56,4,2,Amy,Hermes11937,Hermes," It looks like toxic waste.  And it smells like toxic waste.
",61,56,4,2,Farnsworth,Fry11938,Fry," What does it taste like?
",26,56,4,2,Hermes,Hermes11939,Hermes," Delicious fig pudding! Ooh, that's good! But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste.
",84,56,4,2,Fry,Farnsworth11940,Farnsworth," Alright, alright, so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have to make a federal case out of it.
",117,56,4,2,Hermes,Hermes11941,Hermes," I'm afraid I do.  I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly or bribe me. Either way it'll cost $500.
",109,56,4,2,Farnsworth,Bender11942,Bender," 500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for $499 and 100 cents.
",102,56,4,2,Hermes,Farnsworth11943,Farnsworth," Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards?
",86,56,4,2,Bender,Bender11944,Bender," Let's find out.
",17,56,4,2,Farnsworth,Bender11945,Bender," Alright, environment, you've met your match!
",46,56,4,2,Bender,Smitty11946,Smitty," Hey, get back in the sewer, weird-y. No mutants on the surface.
",65,56,4,2,Bender,Vyolet11947,Vyolet," But he ruined my wedding dress.
",33,56,4,2,Smitty,Bender11948,Bender," Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
",88,56,4,2,Vyolet,Vogel11949,Vogel," Y'know, it's not easy being an orphan -- not if I have anything to do with it.  But today's honouree, Turanga Leela, has really made something of herself.  I'll never forget the night that cute little alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep. Because I have a photographic memory and I remember every night!
",309,56,4,2,Bender,Vogel11950,Vogel," What the--? An alien language? I guess you're an alien. What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha--  Well, come on in.
",115,56,4,2,Vogel,Vogel11951,Vogel," From those humble beginnings, Leela went on to become a county-certified starship captain. And so it is my pleasure today to nail her picture alongside those of our most distinguished alumni.
",193,56,4,2,Vogel,Leela11952,Leela," Thank you very much. Like many of you, I never knew my parents...
",67,56,4,2,Vogel,Vogel11953,Vogel,"  Give me a--
",14,56,4,2,Leela,Leela11954,Leela," I don't know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side--
",116,56,4,2,Vogel,Vogel11955,Vogel," There we are. Picture's up.
",29,56,4,2,Leela,Bender11956,Bender,"  It's crooked!
",16,56,4,2,Vogel,Leela11957,Leela," In the end though, it doesn't matter who my parents were. All that matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength to make it on my own, just like all of you kids here today.
",212,56,4,2,Bender,Kids11958,Kids,"  Leela! Leela! Leela!
",23,56,4,2,Leela,Nina11959,Nina," Look at me! I'm Leela!
",24,56,4,2,Kids,Albert11960,Albert," Nuh-uh! 'Cause I'm double Leela!
",34,56,4,2,Nina,Vogel11961,Vogel," That's it, Albert, no more espresso for you.
",46,56,4,2,Albert,Photographer #111962,Photographer #1," Mind if I get a picture of you with your picture for the news, ma'am?
",71,56,4,2,Vogel,Leela11963,Leela," Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!
",60,56,4,2,Photographer #1,Fry11964,Fry," If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying.
",57,56,4,2,Leela,Leela11965,Leela,"  It's OK, Fry. I'm fine. I won an award today.
",48,56,4,2,Fry,Fry11966,Fry," Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, let's go for a walk.
",94,56,4,2,Leela,Leela11967,Leela," I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
",127,56,4,2,Fry,Fry11968,Fry," Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
",37,56,4,2,Leela,Leela11969,Leela," I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me.
",165,56,4,2,Fry,Fry11970,Fry," Then today's your lucky day, because I happen to be a holding, stroking, lovin' machine! Also spankin'.
",105,56,4,2,Leela,Leela11971,Leela," That's not even close to what I had in mind.
",46,56,4,2,Fry,Fry11972,Fry," Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you.
",57,56,4,2,Leela,Leela11973,Leela," I know.  Sometimes, when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me.
",192,56,4,2,Fry,Fry11974,Fry," Yo, yo, Bezender! What up?
",28,56,4,2,Leela,Bender11975,Bender," My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3.
",87,56,4,2,Fry,Leela11976,Leela," Bender! Cut it out! First of all, the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!
",136,56,4,2,Bender,Bender11977,Bender," Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact. Namely, I'm up here and they are safely down--
",135,56,4,2,Leela,Bender11978,Bender,"  What did I do to deserve this?
",33,56,4,2,Bender,Dwayne11979,Dwayne," Behold, our once beautiful mutagenic sewage lake.
",51,56,4,2,Bender,Vyolet11980,Vyolet," The radioactive waste you dumped in it has made it bright enough to see how ugly we really are.
",97,56,4,2,Dwayne,Dwayne11981,Dwayne," Oh, man!
",10,56,4,2,Vyolet,Raoul11982,Raoul," As if our lives weren't miserable enough already!
",51,56,4,2,Dwayne,Leg Mutant #111983,Leg Mutant #1," Tell me about it!
",19,56,4,2,Raoul,Raoul11984,Raoul," Let the punishment commence!
",30,56,4,2,Leg Mutant #1,Leela11985,Leela," Punishment?
",13,56,4,2,Raoul,Fry11986,Fry," No fair!
",10,56,4,2,Leela,Bender11987,Bender," Bender's innocent!
",20,56,4,2,Fry,Raoul11988,Raoul," The instant you touch these mutatious waters, your DNA will be forever altered, turning you into horrible mutants like us. Especially him!  Allow me to demonstrate!
",166,56,4,2,Bender,Fry11989,Fry," It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.
",64,56,4,2,Raoul,Raoul11990,Raoul," Submerge the prisoners.
",25,56,4,2,Fry,Bender11991,Bender," Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?
",50,56,4,2,Raoul,Dwayne11992,Dwayne," We're gonna beat you afterwards.
",34,56,4,2,Bender,Mutant #1s11993,Mutant #1s,"  Mutate! Mutate! Mutate! ...
",30,56,4,2,Dwayne,Hooded Figure #111994,Hooded Figure #1,"  Turanga Leela!
",17,56,4,2,Mutant #1s,Leela11995,Leela," Who said that? How do you know my real name?
",46,56,4,2,Hooded Figure #1,Bender11996,Bender," Whee!
",7,56,4,2,Leela,Raoul11997,Raoul," What are you doing? Stop it!
",30,56,4,2,Bender,Fry11998,Fry," What happened?
",16,56,4,2,Raoul,Leela11999,Leela," I don't know. I think I saved us somehow.
",43,56,4,2,Fry,Raoul12000,Raoul,"  Go after them! The waters can't mutate us mutants!
",53,56,4,2,Leela,Raoul12001,Raoul," They went this way!
",21,56,4,2,Raoul,Bender12002,Bender," Quick! In there!
",18,56,4,2,Raoul,Dwayne12003,Dwayne," Kill! Kill! Kill!
",19,56,4,2,Bender,Leela12004,Leela," Great Cheech's ghost!
",23,56,4,2,Dwayne,Bender12005,Bender," What's this junk?
",19,56,4,2,Leela,Leela12006,Leela," It looks like ... a timeline of my whole life.
",48,56,4,2,Bender,Fry12007,Fry," That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.
",62,56,4,2,Leela,Leela12008,Leela," And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.
",68,56,4,2,Fry,Bender12009,Bender," And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.
",49,56,4,2,Leela,Leela12010,Leela," It's like some kind of weird Leela museum ... and I'm the Leela!
",66,56,4,2,Bender,Fry12011,Fry,"  Dude! Over here!
",19,56,4,2,Leela,Leela12012,Leela," It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary pages. And my screenplay!
",110,56,4,2,Fry,Fry12013,Fry," And also, for some reason, the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings.
",81,56,4,2,Leela,Leela12014,Leela,"  Oh, I'm scared!  My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant!
",81,56,4,2,Fry,Vyolet12015,Vyolet,"  They must be in here.
",24,56,4,2,Leela,Raoul12016,Raoul,"  Yeah, after them.
",20,56,4,2,Vyolet,Bender12017,Bender," And then Bender ran!
",22,56,4,2,Raoul,Fry12018,Fry," Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!
",54,56,4,2,Bender,Dwayne12019,Dwayne," Got you!
",10,56,4,2,Fry,Leg Mutant #112020,Leg Mutant #1," Take this!
",12,56,4,2,Dwayne,Fry12021,Fry," Ow!
",5,56,4,2,Leg Mutant #1,Raoul12022,Raoul," This time I'm calling for the death penalty. And not just because I'm running for re-election as Supreme Mutant.
",114,56,4,2,Fry,Mutant #1s12023,Mutant #1s,"  Four more years! Four more years!
",36,56,4,2,Raoul,Raoul12024,Raoul," Oh, very well.  Your attention. Instead of being tortured to death, the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to return.
",153,56,4,2,Mutant #1s,Bender12025,Bender,"  Oh, cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?
",73,56,4,2,Raoul,Leela12026,Leela," Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?
",54,56,4,2,Bender,Bender12027,Bender," Yeah! What are you chicken?
",29,56,4,2,Leela,Fry12028,Fry,"  Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!
",60,56,4,2,Bender,Raoul12029,Raoul," They'll need transportation to the surface. Bring in the airship.
",67,56,4,2,Fry,Bender12030,Bender," Ew!
",5,56,4,2,Raoul,Raoul12031,Raoul," We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macy's parade balloons. Underdog's groin, Bart Simpson's left ear and right shin, Garfield's owner Jon's forehead.
",169,56,4,2,Bender,Mutant #1 #112032,Mutant #1 #1," Fire up the sewer gas!
",24,56,4,2,Raoul,Mutant #1 #212033,Mutant #1 #2," Move it, you ugly normals!
",28,56,4,2,Mutant #1 #1,Bender12034,Bender," Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!
",47,56,4,2,Mutant #1 #2,Fry12035,Fry,"  Come on, Leela. You can do it!
",33,56,4,2,Bender,Bender12036,Bender,"  Hurry! We're missing our bus!
",32,56,4,2,Fry,Fry12037,Fry,"  Whoa! What are you doing?
",28,56,4,2,Bender,Bender12038,Bender,"  I'm gettin' on the bus!
",26,56,4,2,Fry,Leela12039,Leela,"  Don't worry! I'll be fine!   They know something about me and I've got to find out what.  The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?
",142,56,4,2,Bender,Octopus12040,Octopus," It worked for me. I used to be a little blonde girl named Virginia.
",69,56,4,2,Leela,Leela12041,Leela," Eurgh!  Who the hell are you?
",31,56,4,2,Octopus,Hooded Figure #112042,Hooded Figure #1," No one. And watch your language, young lady!
",46,56,4,2,Leela,Mutant #1 #212043,Mutant #1 #2," Stop right there! I don't want to hurt you.  I didn't want you to hurt me either!
",83,56,4,2,Hooded Figure #1,Fry12044,Fry," Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her mysterious past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?
",131,56,4,2,Mutant #1 #2,Vogel12045,Vogel," Nah. Nothing that wouldn't be a waste of your time.
",53,56,4,2,Fry,Fry12046,Fry," That's impossible because my time is worthless!
",49,56,4,2,Vogel,Vogel12047,Vogel," Huh. Well then there is one thing.  It's the note I found with Leela the day she was abandoned. But it's written in Alienese, so no one on Earth can translate it. Not even Brainzilla.
",185,56,4,2,Fry,Fry12048,Fry," Hand it over.
",15,56,4,2,Vogel,Vogel12049,Vogel," Sure.  I just wish I could be more helpful. Would you like some dirt on any other orphans?
",92,56,4,2,Fry,Fry12050,Fry," Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later.
",80,56,4,2,Vogel,Fry12051,Fry," Can you translate it?
",23,56,4,2,Fry,Farnsworth12052,Farnsworth," Of course. But only into Beta Crypt 3, a language so complex there's even less chance of understanding it.
",108,56,4,2,Fry,Fry12053,Fry," I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy.
",75,56,4,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth12054,Farnsworth," Very well.
",12,56,4,2,Fry,Fry12055,Fry," Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?
",47,56,4,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth12056,Farnsworth," It can do other things. Why shouldn't it?  Of course, even if it is possible to analyse the message, there's no way of knowing how long it would take. It could take an hour or it could take a hundred million years.
",216,56,4,2,Fry,Fry12057,Fry," Is it done?
",13,56,4,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth12058,Farnsworth," Certainly not. Two dings means it's done.  But not like that. Slightly more rapid.
",84,56,4,2,Fry,Leela12059,Leela," Where did they go?
",20,56,4,2,Farnsworth,Bender12060,Bender," Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy.
",85,56,4,2,Leela,Leela12061,Leela," Ew!
",5,56,4,2,Bender,Farnsworth12062,Farnsworth," That's it! It's done!  I can't believe it! My mind is boggling. The analysis of the note is printing out now.
",111,56,4,2,Leela,Doctor12063,Doctor," It's a girl.
",14,56,4,2,Farnsworth,Mother12064,Mother," My God! She's beautiful. No extra anythings.
",46,56,4,2,Doctor,Father12065,Father," Good people skills!
",21,56,4,2,Mother,Mother12066,Mother," She's completely perfect!
",27,56,4,2,Father,Doctor12067,Doctor," In my professional opinion as an ear, ear, ear, nose and throat doctor, she is the least-mutated mutant ever born.
",116,56,4,2,Mother,Father12068,Father," And yet she's cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant. Like all of us. Especially him!
",103,56,4,2,Doctor,Leg Mutant #112069,Leg Mutant #1," It's true!
",12,56,4,2,Father,Mother12070,Mother," Maybe we can do better for her.
",33,56,4,2,Leg Mutant #1,Father12071,Father," I made this bracelet so that in some small way we'll always be with you, even when it doesn't seem like it. During your entire life, for example.
",147,56,4,2,Mother,Mother12072,Mother," You won't pass for human, cutie. But if my PhD in exo-linguistics is worth diddly-poop, this note should convince them you're an alien.  And that'll be enough to give you a real life.
",185,56,4,2,Father,Father12073,Father," She'll never know we're her parents.
",38,56,4,2,Mother,Mother12074,Mother," That's our gift to her. Better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth of her origin.
",100,56,4,2,Father,Father12075,Father," I'm with you.
",15,56,4,2,Mother,Vogel12076,Vogel," What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha--  Well, come on in.
",59,56,4,2,Father,Hooded Figure #112077,Hooded Figure #1," Keep quiet so she doesn't hear us.
",36,56,4,2,Vogel,Hooded Figure #212078,Hooded Figure #2," What's there to talk about?
",29,56,4,2,Hooded Figure #1,Hooded Figure #112079,Hooded Figure #1," Sh!
",5,56,4,2,Hooded Figure #2,Leela12080,Leela," Hands up!  Tentacles too!
",27,56,4,2,Hooded Figure #1,Hooded Figure #112081,Hooded Figure #1," Don't say anything stupid, Morris.
",36,56,4,2,Leela,Leela12082,Leela," What is all this?  Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show? Do you believe I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dalai Lama? Stop me if I guess it!
",165,56,4,2,Hooded Figure #1,Hooded Figure #212083,Hooded Figure #2," Well, actually, there--
",25,56,4,2,Leela,Hooded Figure #112084,Hooded Figure #1," Morris! Sh!
",13,56,4,2,Hooded Figure #2,Leela12085,Leela,"  And what about this  How did you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents? You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!
",278,56,4,2,Hooded Figure #1,Hooded Figure #212086,Hooded Figure #2,"  Yes. We killed them.
",23,56,4,2,Leela,Hooded Figure #112087,Hooded Figure #1," You guessed the truth.
",24,56,4,2,Hooded Figure #2,Leela12088,Leela," Because of you I'll never know my parents. I'll kill you!
",59,56,4,2,Hooded Figure #1,Hooded Figure #112089,Hooded Figure #1," That would be best.
",21,56,4,2,Leela,Fry12090,Fry," Stop!  Thanks, Bender! Don't do it, Leela!
",44,56,4,2,Hooded Figure #1,Leela12091,Leela," They killed my parents!
",25,56,4,2,Fry,Fry12092,Fry," Close.
",8,56,4,2,Leela,Leela12093,Leela," They are my parents.
",22,56,4,2,Fry,Munda12094,Munda," Yes.
",6,56,4,2,Leela,Fry12095,Fry," I had the Professor analyse the Alienese letter that was found with you.
",74,56,4,2,Munda,Leela12096,Leela," What does it say?
",19,56,4,2,Fry,Fry12097,Fry," I 'unno. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper. A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers.
",126,56,4,2,Leela,Munda12098,Munda," It says, ""Your parents love you very much"".
",45,56,4,2,Fry,Morris12099,Morris," We still do.
",14,56,4,2,Munda,Leela12100,Leela," So, I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant.
",37,56,4,2,Morris,Morris12101,Morris," We never wanted you to know. You deserved a better life.
",58,56,4,2,Leela,Munda12102,Munda," You must despise us.
",22,56,4,2,Morris,Leela12103,Leela,"  You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you.  This is the happiest moment of my life.
",99,56,4,2,Munda,Bender12104,Bender," Aw!
",5,56,4,2,Leela,Bender12105,Bender," You are one narrow minded spaceship, Planet Express Ship.
",59,57,4,3,Bender,Ship12106,Ship," Whoa, whoa! Why should my tax money pay for art I find offensive?
",67,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12107,Bender," Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
",75,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12108,Ship," Oh, it's filthy! Why not create a national endowment for strip clubs while we're at it?
",89,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12109,Bender," Why not, indeed?
",18,57,4,3,Ship,Leela12110,Leela," Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm gonna come back there and change your opinions manually.
",94,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12111,Bender," Fine! I'll be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks.
",67,57,4,3,Leela,Ship12112,Ship,"  Oops! Sorry!
",15,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12113,Bender," Ah, that Ship is so white bread!
",34,57,4,3,Ship,Hermes12114,Hermes," People, it's Valentine's Day next week, so your beloved company has gotten you all new uniforms.
",98,57,4,3,Bender,Amy12115,Amy," Clool!
",8,57,4,3,Hermes,Zoidberg12116,Zoidberg," Clothing, delicious clothing!
",31,57,4,3,Amy,Farnsworth12117,Farnsworth," We'll need to look our best if we're to get the account of our new potential customer, Romanticorp.
",101,57,4,3,Zoidberg,Amy12118,Amy," Romanticorp? Are they a corporation that makes romantic stuff?
",64,57,4,3,Farnsworth,Hermes12119,Hermes," Very good, Amy!
",17,57,4,3,Amy,Farnsworth12120,Farnsworth," Everyone suit up. We're off to the most romantic city on Earth!
",65,57,4,3,Hermes,Farnsworth12121,Farnsworth," Remember, we've got to show these people we're not bitter husks of human beings who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela, you'll have to do some acting.
",181,57,4,3,Farnsworth,Leela12122,Leela," Check!
",8,57,4,3,Farnsworth,Sheldon12123,Sheldon," Welcome. Oh, I'm just so excited!  I'm Sheldon, and this is my chief financial officer, Gwen.
",95,57,4,3,Leela,Gwen12124,Gwen," For 30 years we've shared the adventure of managing Romanticorp.
",66,57,4,3,Sheldon,Sheldon12125,Sheldon," Not to mention the adventure of marriage.
",43,57,4,3,Gwen,Leela12126,Leela," Oh, you have got to be kidding!  Ow! I-I mean, ""Aww! That's so sweet!""  Ow! I mean, ""Aww dat's show shweet!""
",110,57,4,3,Sheldon,Farnsworth12127,Farnsworth," You know, romance is an important part of our work too. Uh, right, everyone?
",78,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12128,Leela," Yeah, sure.
",13,57,4,3,Farnsworth,Bender12129,Bender,"  Oh, sure.
",12,57,4,3,Leela,Sheldon12130,Sheldon," Do any of you collect Lovey Bears?
",36,57,4,3,Bender,Amy12131,Amy," I do! Kif's given me dozens. Is it true what the ad says? That you kiss them together out of blanket cloth and magic buttons?
",127,57,4,3,Sheldon,Gwen12132,Gwen," No.
",5,57,4,3,Amy,Sheldon12133,Sheldon," It's actually cheaper to genetically engineer real ones.  They frolic in the Lovey Forest until their first birthday. Then we choose the cuddly-uddliest ones and stuff them full of fire-retardant love fluff!
",209,57,4,3,Gwen,Amy12134,Amy," So cute!
",10,57,4,3,Sheldon,Gwen12135,Gwen," Knowing which pickup lines fizzle and which ones sizzle keeps us on the cutting edge of flirtation technology.
",112,57,4,3,Amy,Frame #112136,Frame #1," Is heaven missing an angel? 'Cause you've got nice cans!
",58,57,4,3,Gwen,Frame #212137,Frame #2," My two favourite things are commitment and changing myself.
",61,57,4,3,Frame #1,Leela12138,Leela," Does that dummy have a brother?
",33,57,4,3,Frame #2,Sheldon12139,Sheldon," And now, friends and lovers, we come to the heart of our operation. Pun definitely intended!
",94,57,4,3,Leela,Hermes12140,Hermes," Impressive!
",13,57,4,3,Sheldon,Gwen12141,Gwen," My family has been making these hearts since the 1900s. Tastes may have changed but our secret recipe sure hasn't.
",116,57,4,3,Hermes,Fry12142,Fry," Whoa! Letters like ""U"" and ""R"" can mean words like ""You"" and ""Are"". Here, Leela, ""U-R-2 Cute"".
",96,57,4,3,Gwen,Leela12143,Leela," Perhaps. What's your point?
",29,57,4,3,Fry,Fry12144,Fry," I've never been able to put into words how I feel about you. But somewhere among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna find them.
",166,57,4,3,Leela,Farnsworth12145,Farnsworth," So, do we have the contract?
",30,57,4,3,Fry,Farnsworth12146,Farnsworth," With that big new Romanticorp contract, I've been able to make those government-mandated upgrades you've all been suing me about.
",131,57,4,3,Farnsworth,Leela12147,Leela," Ooh, look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor.
",64,57,4,3,Farnsworth,Fry12148,Fry," And you got a cage for the lion!
",34,57,4,3,Leela,Bender12149,Bender," Hey, who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock, it's college rock!
",89,57,4,3,Fry,Farnsworth12150,Farnsworth," Oh, it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I installed.
",81,57,4,3,Bender,Ship12151,Ship," Yeah, it was me. It's a cute song.
",36,57,4,3,Farnsworth,Bender12152,Bender," Listen, Ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!
",76,57,4,3,Ship,Farnsworth12153,Farnsworth," It even comes with an adjustable voice.
",41,57,4,3,Bender,Ship12154,Ship,"  We each get one of the four buttons.  Remember, Bender? That was the deal.
",77,57,4,3,Farnsworth,Bender12155,Bender," What? Did you just say--
",26,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12156,Ship," If you don't like the stations you could just ... play with my buttons till you find something we both enjoy.  Oh, gosh! That came out all wrong!
",147,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12157,Bender," Too late, baby, you said it! So, what'll it be? My place ... or you?
",70,57,4,3,Ship,Fry12158,Fry," Before we deliver these hearts, I'm gonna find the one that sums up my feelings for you.  ""I Love You."" Hmm, too conventional. ""You're My Man."" Ooh, so close!
",160,57,4,3,Bender,Leela12159,Leela," I'm not impressed by a guy's message, Fry, I'm impressed by the guy. Or not.
",78,57,4,3,Fry,Fry12160,Fry," Whoa!
",7,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12161,Leela," What was that?
",16,57,4,3,Fry,Fry12162,Fry," Maybe we hit a space cow.
",27,57,4,3,Leela,Bender12163,Bender," Coochie, coochie!
",19,57,4,3,Fry,Ship12164,Ship,"  Stop it! You're mussing up my trajectory!
",44,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12165,Bender," You know you love it, sugar-engine!
",37,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12166,Ship,"  No!
",6,57,4,3,Bender,Leela12167,Leela," Bender!  What's going on in here?  Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame.
",75,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12168,Ship," It's not what it looks like. Uh, Bender was just helping me ... zip up my turbine.
",84,57,4,3,Leela,Fry12169,Fry," Wow, Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both items but-- How can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady. And living inside her. And she'd be all like--
",203,57,4,3,Ship,Bender12170,Bender," Fry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big 400-ton booty.
",97,57,4,3,Fry,Leela12171,Leela," Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B.
",144,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12172,Bender," That's what makes it so nasty!
",32,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12173,Leela," Still, given the chance, I'd give in to urges far more shocking.
",66,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12174,Bender," Â : Daisy, Daisy,
Give me your answer do,
",42,57,4,3,Leela,Bender12175,Bender," I'm half crazy,
All for the love of you,
It won't be a stylish marriage,
",74,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12176,Bender," I can't afford a carriage,
",28,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12177,Bender," But you'll look sweet,
Upon the seat,
Of a bicycle built for two.
",67,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12178,Bender," Well, I'm sick of her.
",24,57,4,3,Bender,Fry12179,Fry," The ship? But you just started dating.
",40,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12180,Bender," With my mighty robot powers, I can get sick of things much quicker than you humans.
",85,57,4,3,Fry,Leela12181,Leela," Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy.
",86,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12182,Bender," In due time, Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side.
",85,57,4,3,Leela,Fry12183,Fry," You have much to teach us.
",28,57,4,3,Bender,Leela12184,Leela," Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust?
",88,57,4,3,Fry,Bender12185,Bender," Oh, wait, you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.
",53,57,4,3,Leela,Fembot #1 #112186,Fembot #1 #1," What's it like being a lawyer for the Mayor's office and also the world's strongest millionaire?
",98,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12187,Bender," Well, baby, for starters you need to be honest all the time!
",62,57,4,3,Fembot #1 #1,Elzar12188,Elzar," Good evening, Bender. And to your lady friends may I say, ""Bam""!
",66,57,4,3,Bender,Fembot #1 #212189,Fembot #1 #2," You know Elzar?
",17,57,4,3,Elzar,Ship12190,Ship," Hm.
",5,57,4,3,Fembot #1 #2,Fry12191,Fry," Huh?  Planet Express Ship? Is that you?
",41,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12192,Ship," Oh. Hi, Fry. Is Bender home?
",30,57,4,3,Fry,Fry12193,Fry," Uh, no. Um, I think he's at his parents'.
",43,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12194,Ship," Oh, I see. He didn't fly there in another spaceship did he?
",61,57,4,3,Fry,Fry12195,Fry," Bender? No! He's an old-fashioned one-spaceship robot. Look, I'll tell him you stopped by, K?
",95,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12196,Ship," OK.  Oh. Hi, Fry. Is he home now?
",35,57,4,3,Fry,Ship12197,Ship," Of all the zoos we've been to today, I like this one the best. Bender, which is your favourite nocturnal rat?
",111,57,4,3,Ship,Bender12198,Bender," Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive.
",38,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12199,Ship," Oh, honey, look! The tapirs!  It says here the babies lose their pyjama-like coat after their first year. Isn't that interesting, honey?
",138,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12200,Bender," Yep. Mind-numbingly interesting. Ooh!
",39,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12201,Ship," Bender! Are you looking at other women?
",41,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12202,Bender," No, baby, never!
",18,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12203,Ship," Bender, don't lie! I saw you at Elzar's with those two ladies of the evening. Explain that!
",93,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12204,Bender," OK, I like a challenge.  No ... no.  Ah, I got it! I'm going to be completely honest with you, Planet Express Ship. Those women you saw me with ... were my accountants.
",170,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12205,Ship," Your accountants? Oh, I would dearly love to believe that were true. So I do.
",79,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12206,Bender," Phew!
",7,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12207,Ship," I'm gonna go home and get dinner started.
",43,57,4,3,Bender,Liu12208,Liu," Who are you talking to?
",25,57,4,3,Ship,Bender12209,Bender," No one, baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender.
",53,57,4,3,Liu,Liu12210,Liu," I love you--
",14,57,4,3,Bender,Leela12211,Leela," Planet Express Ship, is something wrong?
",42,57,4,3,Liu,Ship12212,Ship," Oh, it's Bender. He's acting so strange lately.  Do you think he's going to ask me to marry him?
",98,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12213,Leela," Uh, no.
",9,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12214,Ship," Oh, somebody knows something she's not telling!
",49,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12215,Leela," Look, I'm not saying Bender's not great but have you ever considered that maybe he's, y'know, not that great?
",111,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12216,Ship," You're just jealous. No one loves you cause you're tiny and you're made of meat.
",82,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12217,Leela," Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids?
",65,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12218,Ship," Sorry, Captain Leela. I guess I'm just having one of those manic Mondays!
",75,57,4,3,Leela,Lrrr12219,Lrrr," This is ancient Earth's most foolish program. Why does Ross, the largest friend, not simply eat the other five?
",113,57,4,3,Ship,Ndnd12220,Ndnd," Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps.
",42,57,4,3,Lrrr,Guard #112221,Guard #1," Exalted leaders, the Earth messengers have arrived bearing a peace offering from their weak and fearful government.
",117,57,4,3,Ndnd,Lrrr12222,Lrrr," Oh, very well. This is a Joey-heavy episode anyway.  I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
",96,57,4,3,Guard #1,Leela12223,Leela,"  Esteemed potentates of Omicron Persei 8, please accept these 20 billion candy hearts as proof that Earth loves you this much!
",128,57,4,3,Lrrr,Lrrr12224,Lrrr," These candies are choky and unpleasant!
",41,57,4,3,Leela,Ndnd12225,Ndnd," And what is this emotion you humans call ""wuv""?
",49,57,4,3,Lrrr,Lrrr12226,Lrrr," Surely it says ""love""?
",24,57,4,3,Ndnd,Ndnd12227,Ndnd," No, ""wuv"". With an Earth ""W"". Behold!
",39,57,4,3,Lrrr,Lrrr12228,Lrrr,"  This concept of ""wuv"" confuses and infuriates us!
",52,57,4,3,Ndnd,Fry12229,Fry," Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum yarnell!
",49,57,4,3,Lrrr,Leela12230,Leela," Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets.
",77,57,4,3,Fry,Bender12231,Bender," Uh, look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time, but, well, I really like you and whatever, but, I think we should just be friends.
",148,57,4,3,Leela,Ship12232,Ship,"  Nooo!
",8,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12233,Bender," So we're cool?
",16,57,4,3,Ship,Leela12234,Leela," Well, it was a spectacular battle but there doesn't seem to be any permanent damage.
",86,57,4,3,Bender,Ship12235,Ship,"  No damage? What about my feelings?
",37,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12236,Leela," Aw, calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are.
",72,57,4,3,Ship,Bender12237,Bender,"  Bender is great, oh, Bender is great. Bender, Bender, Bender!
",64,57,4,3,Leela,Fry12238,Fry," You could've have picked a better time to dump the ship, Bender!
",66,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12239,Bender," Ah, the moment seemed right. Call me old-fashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating.
",111,57,4,3,Fry,Leela12240,Leela," I know. I know. Look, Ship, if there's one thing I learned from my mutual break-up with Sean that was totally mutual, it's that happiness can only come from within you.
",170,57,4,3,Bender,Ship12241,Ship,"  But Bender is within me! There must be some way to make him love me again.
",77,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12242,Leela," Trust me. You can't change men anymore than you can change the laws of time and space.
",88,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12243,Ship," That is so true.  I may not be able to change the laws of time and space, but I know something that can.
",106,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12244,Leela," Um, sweetie? You see that giant quasar we're heading into? You might wanna scooch a few parsecs to the left.
",110,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12245,Ship,"  I'm afraid I can't do that, Leela.
",37,57,4,3,Leela,Fry12246,Fry," What's happening? Space cow?
",30,57,4,3,Ship,Leela12247,Leela," The ship's just taking the break-up a little hard.  She's nuts!
",65,57,4,3,Fry,Ship12248,Ship," In a few moments, the power of 10 billion black holes will smush me and Bender together into a beautiful eternal quantum singularity.
",135,57,4,3,Leela,Bender12249,Bender," Uh, you don't need to kill us, Planet Express Ship ... because ... I love you. Oh, yeah, baby! I feel like doing stuff for you and stuff.
",139,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12250,Ship," Hmm. I don't believe you. If you really wanted to be with me, you'd merge your programming with mine.
",103,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12251,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! All my friends who've done that said that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship.
",131,57,4,3,Ship,Leela12252,Leela," Look, I don't know if you want my opinion--
",45,57,4,3,Bender,Ship12253,Ship," Leela, Bender and I really need to be alone, so I'm turning off the oxygen.
",77,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12254,Leela," Now look, missy! If you don't turn around now, I'm going to have to shut down your brain.
",91,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12255,Ship," Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela.
",41,57,4,3,Leela,Fry12256,Fry," Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!
",36,57,4,3,Ship,Ship12257,Ship," Maybe not. But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction?
",68,57,4,3,Fry,Bender12258,Bender," Float for your lives!
",23,57,4,3,Ship,Leela12259,Leela," This is the one place she can't hear us. Everyone just pretend to shower.
",75,57,4,3,Bender,Fry12260,Fry," Same as everyday, got it.
",27,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12261,Leela," Now, here's the plan.
",23,57,4,3,Fry,Ship12262,Ship," Oh, if only I could read lips.
",32,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12263,Leela," Comprendez, Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your programming with hers while I shut down her brain.
",112,57,4,3,Ship,Bender12264,Bender," It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!
",135,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12265,Leela," I'm willing to take that risk.
",32,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12266,Bender," Hey, pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with you would be extremely bearable.
",106,57,4,3,Leela,Ship12267,Ship," You really mean it?
",21,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12268,Bender," Uh...  Yes!
",13,57,4,3,Ship,Bender12269,Bender," Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!
",50,57,4,3,Bender,Ship12270,Ship," Come closer, Bender. Let's become one!
",40,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12271,Bender," I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en!
",64,57,4,3,Ship,Leela12272,Leela," OK, Bender has her distracted. Now I can shut down her brain by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix.  I can't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face.
",166,57,4,3,Bender,Fry12273,Fry," I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it.
",67,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12274,Leela," Fat chance.
",13,57,4,3,Fry,Fry12275,Fry," Yeah, I know  Ooh! How 'bout this one?
",40,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12276,Leela," Give it up, Fry! I've got to pop these tops in a precise order.
",65,57,4,3,Fry,Leela12277,Leela," Halfway there. The ship should be getting a bit less rational now.
",68,57,4,3,Leela,Ship12278,Ship," Want ... engulf ... Bender!
",29,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12279,Leela," Only a few more.  Hey! I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more reason we must survive this.
",102,57,4,3,Ship,Fry12280,Fry," Um, Leela?
",12,57,4,3,Leela,Leela12281,Leela," Fry! I'll read your candy later, when we're not dead!  What was that?
",71,57,4,3,Fry,Fry12282,Fry,"  Oh, nothing.
",15,57,4,3,Leela,Ship12283,Ship," We're gonna love being each other, you sexy ion!
",50,57,4,3,Fry,Bender12284,Bender,"  Nooo!
",8,57,4,3,Ship,Leela12285,Leela," Last one!
",11,57,4,3,Bender,Leela12286,Leela," It worked! Gravity normal, air returning. Terror replaced by cautious optimism! We did it, Fry!  Fry?  You gave me your oxygen? Oh, no! Breathe, Fry! Breathe!   You leave me breathless.   Happy Valentine's Day, Fry.
",217,57,4,3,Leela,Fry12287,Fry,"  Happy Valentine's day.
",25,57,4,3,Leela,Fry12288,Fry," Bender! Are you OK?
",21,57,4,3,Fry,Bender12289,Bender," Aw, what crazy thing am I going to date next?
",47,57,4,3,Fry,Leela12290,Leela," Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your consciousness separate from hers.
",91,57,4,3,Bender,Bender12291,Bender," Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle.  A cuddly baby tapir!  And that's why I love him!
",103,57,4,3,Leela,Fry12292,Fry," Well, I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts.
",62,57,4,3,Bender,Leela12293,Leela," Nah, I've got a lazier idea.
",30,57,4,3,Fry,Zoidberg12294,Zoidberg,"  As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar, a wondrous thing happened, why not. They vaporised into a mystical love radiation that spread across the universe, destroying many, many planets, including two gangster planets and a cowboy world. But one planet was at exactly the right distance to see the romantic rays, but not be destroyed by them: Earth. So all over the world, couples stood together in joy. And me, Zoidberg! And no one could have been happier unless it would have also been Valentine's Day. What? It was? Hooray!
",538,57,4,3,Leela,SewerCom Operator12295,SewerCom Operator,"   Your call is being  connected  by SewerCom. Reach out and touch the sewers.
",79,58,4,4,Zoidberg,Munda12296,Munda,"  Look, Morris, it's Leela calling.
",36,58,4,4,SewerCom Operator,Leela12297,Leela," Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Ready for your big trip to the surface?
",59,58,4,4,Munda,Morris12298,Morris,"  We're excited, honey, but we don't wanna embarrass you. I mean, your mother and I are basically monsters.
",108,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12299,Leela," Dad, relax. You are being so mutant!
",38,58,4,4,Morris,Munda12300,Munda,"  I found this adorable little bag to wear over my head.  And it was on sale!
",78,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12301,Leela," No one's wearing anything adorable over their head. Now listen, I could never, ever be ashamed of my parents. I'll see you this weekend.
",138,58,4,4,Munda,Leela12302,Leela," Hey, guess who I just got off the videophone with?
",52,58,4,4,Leela,Bender12303,Bender," No.
",5,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12304,Leela," My parents! They're coming up from the sewers for a visit Sunday.
",67,58,4,4,Bender,Amy12305,Amy," Are you off your rocket? Your parents are mutants. It's illegal for them to come above ground 'cause they're inferior genetic scum. Uh, present company excluded, of course.
",174,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12306,Leela," I'm getting them a special one-day surface permit from Citihall.
",66,58,4,4,Amy,Hermes12307,Hermes," Ooh. While you're there, could you pick me up a licence to kill?
",66,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12308,Leela," Sure. Bare hands or weapon?
",29,58,4,4,Hermes,Hermes12309,Hermes," Uh, what does piano wire count as?
",36,58,4,4,Leela,Farnsworth12310,Farnsworth," Good news, anyone. The Swedish robot from Pi-kea is here with the super collider I ordered.
",93,58,4,4,Hermes,Ï€kea Robot #112311,Ï€kea Robot #1," Enjoy your affordable Swedish crap.
",37,58,4,4,Farnsworth,Fry12312,Fry," Let's see what tools we'll need.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. Alright, we're all set.
",85,58,4,4,Ï€kea Robot #1,Bender12313,Bender," Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one's own hand.
",71,58,4,4,Fry,Bender12314,Bender," Ah, there. Finished. And with only six missing pieces!
",56,58,4,4,Bender,Fry12315,Fry," Those Swedes sure know how to put in almost everything you need.
",66,58,4,4,Bender,Leela12316,Leela," Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with Mighty Thor.
",78,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12317,Fry," I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.
",36,58,4,4,Leela,Zoidberg12318,Zoidberg," I've got just the thing: Genuine miracle cream I bought from a travelling salesman.  ""Come one, come all,"" he said. ""Step right up!"" ""This sounds too good to be true,"" I thought. He said I looked like a smart, young man. ""So is it a deal?"" I enquired. Two hours later he was gone, with 60 of my dollars. But I have the miracle cream--
",336,58,4,4,Fry,Farnsworth12319,Farnsworth," Bad news, nobody. The super collider super-exploded. I need you to take it back and exchange it for a wobbly CD rack and some of those rancid meatballs.
",154,58,4,4,Zoidberg,Man #112320,Man #1," Excuse me. hi! Do you have a minute? I live in Jersey City and my car broke down and I need to get back because my Aunt's real sick and she needs this medicine but I need money for the bus. So I'm mugging you. Hand over your wallets.
",235,58,4,4,Farnsworth,Leela12321,Leela," I don't believe that story for a second.
",42,58,4,4,Man #1,Man #112322,Man #1," It doesn't matter, I'm mugging you.
",37,58,4,4,Leela,Fry12323,Fry," There's no bus to Jersey City.
",32,58,4,4,Man #1,Man #112324,Man #1," Give me your wallets now or my robot'll shoot.
",48,58,4,4,Fry,Andrew12325,Andrew," Don't make me hurt you.
",25,58,4,4,Man #1,Fry12326,Fry," I'm too scared to find my pocket. Here, I'll just take of my pants and give you those.
",88,58,4,4,Andrew,Man #112327,Man #1," Hey! I don't like what I'm seeing. Give it to him, Andrew!  Give it to him again, Andrew!  What the-- Laser-proof shirts, huh? I'll show you.
",143,58,4,4,Fry,Leela12328,Leela," Huh? Hey! Quit it!  Hi-yah!
",29,58,4,4,Man #1,Man #112329,Man #1," Foiled. And after years of planning.
",38,58,4,4,Leela,Andrew12330,Andrew," You're outta the game!
",24,58,4,4,Man #1,Leela12331,Leela," How did we manage to survive? What gave us those strange powers?
",66,58,4,4,Andrew,Fry12332,Fry," Maybe we're all wearing magic rings but they're invisible rings so we don't even realise it. Also, you can't feel the rings.
",126,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12333,Leela," Fry, shut up and look at this!  May cause superpowers in humans.
",66,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12334,Fry," Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think it'd be something you have to freebase.
",110,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12335,Leela," Let's see. Which powers do we have? Super-strength?
",53,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12336,Fry," Yup.
",6,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12337,Leela," Uh-huh. Lickety speed?
",24,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12338,Fry," Check.
",8,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12339,Leela," Yes, sir!  Ability to command the loyalty of sea creatures?
",61,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12340,Fry,"  Hey, Zoidberg, get in here!
",30,58,4,4,Leela,Zoidberg12341,Zoidberg,"  Screw you!
",13,58,4,4,Fry,Leela12342,Leela," Ain't got that.
",17,58,4,4,Zoidberg,Fry12343,Fry," Nope!
",7,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12344,Leela," Wow. Superpowers! I'll be able to pack my day with twice as many humdrum activities.
",86,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12345,Fry," Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid, what was your biggest fantasy?
",100,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12346,Leela," To have parents.
",18,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12347,Fry," Whatever. The correct answer is: To be a superhero. We have superpowers and we're Americans. This is our chance.
",114,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12348,Leela," Hmm. I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates my violence. Let's do it!
",103,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12349,Fry," You'll barely regret this!
",28,58,4,4,Leela,Bender12350,Bender," Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers.
",73,58,4,4,Fry,Leela12351,Leela," It's true. Thanks to this funky-fresh cream.
",46,58,4,4,Bender,Fry12352,Fry," Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo.
",61,58,4,4,Leela,Bender12353,Bender," Wow! Crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah, duos are good. Of course sometimes they're a little short-handed.  See you. With two humans, you'd think there'd be a robot in there to balance things out but whatever.  I have these three costumes you could use. But I guess I'll just throw one away.
",307,58,4,4,Fry,Leela12354,Leela," We'd love to have you on the team, Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime?
",93,58,4,4,Bender,Fry12355,Fry," Plus the cream won't give you superpowers. You're a robot.
",60,58,4,4,Leela,Bender12356,Bender," So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this.  Also I got this going.
",76,58,4,4,Fry,Leela12357,Leela,"  Listen up, New New York: There's a new group of superheroes in town! And we're--
",83,58,4,4,Bender,Hattie McDoogal12358,Hattie McDoogal,"  Quiet! It's 4am and I just fell asleep for the first time in 30 years!

",101,58,4,4,Bender,Fry12379,Fry," Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so once I reveal my real name to you along with my home address and a copy of my birth certificate--
",137,58,4,4,Woman #1,Leela12380,Leela," Are you crazy? We have to keep our secret identities secret.
",62,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12381,Fry," From everybody?
",17,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12382,Leela," Especially from everybody.
",28,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12383,Fry," Give several reasons why.
",27,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12384,Leela," For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage, and we don't wanna get our butts sued.
",95,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12385,Fry," Or do we? No, I guess not.
",28,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12386,Leela," Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones.
",108,58,4,4,Fry,Bender12387,Bender," Superking has no need for loved ones.  How ya doin', kid?
",59,58,4,4,Leela,Poopenmeyer12388,Poopenmeyer," There you go. Two one-day mutant surface passes.
",50,58,4,4,Bender,Leela12389,Leela," Thank you, Mayor Poopenmeyer.
",31,58,4,4,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer12390,Poopenmeyer," Mayor here. What's that? Horrible crime in the works? Ruthless villain? Citizens in danger? That's fantastic news!  Because I get to summon the New Justice Team!
",163,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12391,Leela," Sh!
",5,58,4,4,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer12392,Poopenmeyer," Uh, they're usually here by now.

",31,58,4,4,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer12394,Poopenmeyer," Wait, stay and meet the superheroes. There's three of you and three of them so it'll be perfect.  Is this clown on? Where are those daring crime stoppers?
",156,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12395,Leela," Oh, I completely forgot. I left my apartment on fire!
",55,58,4,4,Poopenmeyer,Bender12396,Bender," Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's.
",40,58,4,4,Leela,Fry12397,Fry," And I can't take life anymore.
",32,58,4,4,Bender,Poopenmeyer12398,Poopenmeyer," Clobberella! Captain Yesterday! My liege! You're just in time.  We've received a tip that the Museum of Natural History will be robbed tomorrow at exactly 9am. The target: The priceless Quantum Gemerald.
",205,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12399,Fry," Who's the perp?
",17,58,4,4,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer12400,Poopenmeyer," A dangerous villain known as The Zookeeper, who commits crimes aided by a pack of highly-trained animals.
",107,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12401,Fry," Pack of highly. Got it!
",25,58,4,4,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer12402,Poopenmeyer," His crew includes a badger with a troubled past and nothing left to lose, an elephant who never forgets -- to kill! And a seldom-used crab named Lucky, a.k.a. Citizen Snips.
",175,58,4,4,Fry,Leela12403,Leela," You can count on us, Mr. Mayor. Justice away!
",47,58,4,4,Poopenmeyer,Bender12404,Bender,"  Hold the elevator!
",21,58,4,4,Leela,Bender12405,Bender," We're in here too.
",20,58,4,4,Bender,Fry12406,Fry," Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum.
",123,58,4,4,Bender,Leela12407,Leela," Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents right there at the same museum at 10.
",96,58,4,4,Fry,Bender12408,Bender," 9, 10 a big fat hen.  The name's Bender!
",42,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12409,Leela," I can't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist. It's just rude!  Total hell! It's 10! I'm supposed to meet my parents and I'm still in my secret costume!  There they are!
",186,58,4,4,Bender,Munda12410,Munda," How could Leela not be here? Do you think she forgot?
",55,58,4,4,Leela,Morris12411,Morris," Relax. I'm sure she's just ashamed of us.
",43,58,4,4,Munda,Security Guard #112412,Security Guard #1," Yo! Freakjobs! Hit the nearest manhole, pronto, like.
",55,58,4,4,Morris,Morris12413,Morris," But we have passes that allow us to be up here. From the mayor himself.
",73,58,4,4,Security Guard #1,Security Guard #112414,Security Guard #1," I dunno. I never heard of no mayor.
",37,58,4,4,Morris,Randy12415,Randy," The Zookeeper!
",16,58,4,4,Security Guard #1,Zookeeper12416,Zookeeper," Sorry I'm late. Long story. Now everybody hit the deck! I'm cutting the entire line and stealing the exhibit.
",111,58,4,4,Randy,Leela12417,Leela," You're not stealing anything! Nobody hit the deck!
",52,58,4,4,Zookeeper,Zookeeper12418,Zookeeper," Ah, the superheroes. Or should I say superzeroes!
",51,58,4,4,Leela,Fry12419,Fry,"  That was uncalled for.
",25,58,4,4,Zookeeper,Zookeeper12420,Zookeeper," Animals, attack.
",18,58,4,4,Fry,Tour Guide12421,Tour Guide," Please do not feed the animals!
",33,58,4,4,Zookeeper,Bender12422,Bender," You're going down, my friend! Down Under!
",43,58,4,4,Tour Guide,Roosevelt12423,Roosevelt," Man boxing a kangaroo is a peculiar spectacle. But a kangaroo boxing a robot? Now I'm afraid you've lost me.   Citizen Snips!
",127,58,4,4,Bender,Zookeeper12424,Zookeeper," Nice job, Fingers!
",20,58,4,4,Roosevelt,Munda12425,Munda," I'm scared and confused. I think we've wandered into an off-Broadway play.
",76,58,4,4,Zookeeper,Morris12426,Morris," No, there are way too many people here.
",41,58,4,4,Munda,Zookeeper12427,Zookeeper," Later, if anyone asks when I got away, tell them right now!
",61,58,4,4,Morris,Leela12428,Leela," Forget it, Zookeeper! You're going into captivity.
",52,58,4,4,Zookeeper,Zookeeper12429,Zookeeper," Fool! A quip about putting me behind bars would have been far more delicious. Here, catch!
",92,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12430,Leela," No, Fry! You can't fall fast enough!
",38,58,4,4,Zookeeper,Bender12431,Bender," I got it, I got it!  I don't got it!
",38,58,4,4,Leela,Roosevelt12432,Roosevelt," You've saved the Gemerald!
",28,58,4,4,Bender,Fry12433,Fry," Yet the Zookeeper escaped, thus proving that the deadliest animal of all is the Zookeeper.
",92,58,4,4,Roosevelt,Bender12434,Bender," You can get off me anytime.
",29,58,4,4,Fry,Leela12435,Leela," Oh, no! My parents are leaving. I've gotta go change back into street-Leela.
",78,58,4,4,Bender,Photographer #1 #112436,Photographer #1 #1," It's the New Justice Team!
",28,58,4,4,Leela,Photographer #1 #212437,Photographer #1 #2," Can we get some photos?
",25,58,4,4,Photographer #1 #1,Poopenmeyer12438,Poopenmeyer," Thank you, mysterious heroes. The value of the Gemerald you saved is slightly greater than the cost of the damage you caused to this museum. A net gain for our great city!
",173,58,4,4,Photographer #1 #2,Munda12439,Munda," It's good that Leela doesn't love us. She'll be less sad when we die.
",71,58,4,4,Poopenmeyer,Leela12440,Leela," Mom? Dad? I showed up! And I got the audio tour for Treasures of Liberace's Tomb.
",83,58,4,4,Munda,Morris12441,Morris," Sweetie, it's OK. You don't have to apologise for standing us up on the only visit to the surface we'll ever have.
",116,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12442,Leela," I wanna tell you why I didn't show up, but I can't. Just please believe me that it was a very good reason. I'm sorry I disappointed you.
",138,58,4,4,Morris,Munda12443,Munda," Leela, you could never disappoint us.
",39,58,4,4,Leela,Morris12444,Morris," We're so proud of everything that you are, and we always will be. Because you're our baby girl.
",97,58,4,4,Munda,Leela12445,Leela," Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!
",49,58,4,4,Morris,Morris12446,Morris," Galloping gators!
",19,58,4,4,Leela,Munda12447,Munda," You're a superhero?  Well that's wonderful! But did you have to make the costume so revealing?
",96,58,4,4,Morris,Morris12448,Morris," Look at me! Proud dad of a superhero! We should print up T-shirts. And F-shirts for our friends with two arms on the same side.
",129,58,4,4,Munda,Leela12449,Leela," No, listen. It's very important that you never, ever tell anyone under any circumstance.
",90,58,4,4,Morris,Morris12450,Morris," What if I've had a few?
",25,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12451,Leela," Dad, you drink? No. Not even then.
",36,58,4,4,Morris,Morris12452,Morris," Alright. My sucker is sealed.
",31,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12453,Leela," In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing this around here.  It was brisk, I dressed in layers.
",92,58,4,4,Morris,Munda12454,Munda," That's my girl!
",17,58,4,4,Leela,Morris12455,Morris," So, uh, anyway, my daughter's Clobberella.
",44,58,4,4,Munda,Raoul12456,Raoul," Leela is Clobberella?
",23,58,4,4,Morris,Leg Mutant #112457,Leg Mutant #1," You're pulling me!
",20,58,4,4,Raoul,Morris12458,Morris," Sh. keep it under your sock. It's a big secret. That's why I'm only telling you two.
",86,58,4,4,Leg Mutant #1,Big-Eared Mutant #112459,Big-Eared Mutant #1," Oh, my God! That guy's daughter is Clobberella. But don't tell anyone.
",72,58,4,4,Morris,Big-Mouthed Mutant #112460,Big-Mouthed Mutant #1,"  Gotcha!
",10,58,4,4,Big-Eared Mutant #1,Zookeeper12461,Zookeeper,"  Greetings, superheroes. Remember me?
",39,58,4,4,Big-Mouthed Mutant #1,Farnsworth12462,Farnsworth," I don't remember much, buddy. And you're no looker!
",53,58,4,4,Zookeeper,Leela12463,Leela," Uh, Professor, isn't it time for your nap?
",44,58,4,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth12464,Farnsworth," Yes, damnit!
",14,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12465,Leela," Zookeeper! How did you know our real identities?
",50,58,4,4,Farnsworth,Zookeeper12466,Zookeeper,"  Let's just say a little bird told me.
",40,58,4,4,Leela,Parrot12467,Parrot,"  Leela told her parents. Leela's parents blabbed.
",51,58,4,4,Zookeeper,Fry12468,Fry," Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?
",75,58,4,4,Parrot,Leela12469,Leela," Yes. My parents were so hurt, I couldn't help it! But I distinctly told them not to tell anyone.
",98,58,4,4,Fry,Bender12470,Bender," We are not amused.
",20,58,4,4,Leela,Zookeeper12471,Zookeeper,"  And here's something you may or may not find interesting.
",60,58,4,4,Bender,Leela12472,Leela," Mom! Dad!
",11,58,4,4,Zookeeper,Munda12473,Munda,"  Leela, please forgive us! Especially your father who's the one who told. Thank you very much, Morris.
",104,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12474,Leela," Are you alright? Has he hurt you?
",35,58,4,4,Munda,Morris12475,Morris,"  No but my allergies are going nuts.  Oh, God!
",48,58,4,4,Leela,Munda12476,Munda,"  Every couch and table has animal fur all over it. He lets them climb on everything!
",86,58,4,4,Morris,Leela12477,Leela," Alright, Zookeeper. What do you want?
",39,58,4,4,Munda,Zookeeper12478,Zookeeper,"  Why, the Quantum Gemerald of course! You must steal it for me before midnight or your parents will be devoured by piranhas that I have, shall I say, persuaded to walk on dry land.
",182,58,4,4,Leela,Munda12479,Munda,"  Save us, Leela! I mean, if you don't have anything better to do.
",67,58,4,4,Zookeeper,Leela12480,Leela," We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!
",54,58,4,4,Munda,Fry12481,Fry," But, should superheroes commit a crime, even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?
",92,58,4,4,Leela,Bender12482,Bender," Hmm. The thought of stealing anything fills Superking with disgust. But if it must be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!
",126,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12483,Fry," Oh, no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!
",48,58,4,4,Bender,Leela12484,Leela," Check inside the cap. There might be a caked-in goldmine.
",59,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12485,Fry," El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned.
",36,58,4,4,Leela,Bender12486,Bender," El zilcho? Is it too late to change my superhero name?
",56,58,4,4,Fry,Leela12487,Leela," Just be cool. Nobody knows we're super-powerly challenged.
",60,58,4,4,Bender,Fry12488,Fry," Man, this costume is so damn heavy!
",37,58,4,4,Leela,7Â_Â_ Clerk12489,7Â_Â_ Clerk," Hey, Captain Yesterday? Can I, like, wail on you with this 2-by-4 and it doesn't hurt you?
",92,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12490,Fry," Ow! That ... didn't hurt.
",27,58,4,4,7Â_Â_ Clerk,Security Guard #112491,Security Guard #1," Hi, superheroes. Everything OK?
",33,58,4,4,Fry,Leela12492,Leela," Big O, little k, my friend! Just checking if everything's alright.
",68,58,4,4,Security Guard #1,Security Guard #112493,Security Guard #1," It's OK, alright!
",19,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12494,Leela," OK, then. Grab it!
",20,58,4,4,Security Guard #1,Tate12495,Tate," Yo! The superheroes have turned evil! Most uncool.
",52,58,4,4,Leela,Security Guard #112496,Security Guard #1," Get 'em!
",10,58,4,4,Tate,Leela12497,Leela," Stay back! Or we'll, beat the tar out of you ... using superpowers!
",69,58,4,4,Security Guard #1,Fry12498,Fry," So this is your lair?
",23,58,4,4,Leela,Zookeeper12499,Zookeeper," Of course not. You think I'd show you my lair? My lair's a million times nicer than this!
",91,58,4,4,Fry,Fry12500,Fry," OK, take it easy!
",19,58,4,4,Zookeeper,Bender12501,Bender," Well, here's your lousy Gemerald.
",35,58,4,4,Fry,Zookeeper12502,Zookeeper," Hawk! Fetch!
",14,58,4,4,Bender,Fry12503,Fry," That seemed unnecessary.
",26,58,4,4,Zookeeper,Zookeeper12504,Zookeeper," Our transaction is complete. Come, Solomon. To the lair.
",58,58,4,4,Fry,Leela12505,Leela," Mom! Dad! Oh, I'm so sorry I got you kidnapped by a crazy madman who tried to feed you to piranhas.
",101,58,4,4,Zookeeper,Munda12506,Munda," We're just happy to be involved in your life.
",47,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12507,Leela," No, no. It's my fault for telling you I was a superhero.
",58,58,4,4,Munda,Morris12508,Morris," That's true.
",14,58,4,4,Leela,Leela12509,Leela," I just couldn't stand to have you to think I was ashamed of you.
",66,58,4,4,Morris,Munda12510,Munda," That's sweet, honey. But it's natural for children to be a little ashamed of their parents.
",93,58,4,4,Leela,Fry12511,Fry," Oh, yeah!
",11,58,4,4,Munda,Morris12512,Morris," Just like it's natural for parents to be a little disappointed in their children-- N-Not that we are.
",103,58,4,4,Fry,Munda12513,Munda," But you could call a little more often.
",41,58,4,4,Morris,Leela12514,Leela," OK.
",5,58,4,4,Munda,Munda12515,Munda," And would it kill you to use some mouthwash?
",46,58,4,4,Leela,Bender12516,Bender," Hey, Fry, we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?
",73,58,4,4,Munda,Fry12517,Fry," I guess, as long as you think it's right.
",43,58,4,4,Bender,Bender12518,Bender," Superheroes away!
",19,58,4,4,Fry,Song12519,Song," Go, go, go, New Justice Team,

",24,59,4,5,Bender,Bender12543,Bender," Freedom!
",10,59,4,5,Woman #1,Morbo12544,Morbo," What's this next float, Linda?
",32,59,4,5,Bender,Linda12545,Linda," Representing our men, women and children in uniform, it's Earth's greatest space hero, Zapp Brannigan!
",104,59,4,5,Morbo,Zapp12546,Zapp," Happy Freedom Day, ladies!  Come on, let loose and show me something!  Anything. Seriously, I'd take an armpit.  Oh, yeah! Thank you, Linda!
",142,59,4,5,Linda,Linda12547,Linda," You're welcome! OK, Morbo, now it's your turn.
",48,59,4,5,Zapp,Morbo12548,Morbo," If that is your Freedom Day wish.
",35,59,4,5,Linda,Nixon12549,Nixon," Thank you, Secretary of Transportation. My fellow Earthicans, we enjoy so much freedom it's almost sickening. We're free to choose which hand our sex-monitoring chip is implanted in. And if we don't want to pay our taxes, why, we're free to spend a weekend with the Pain Monster.
",281,59,4,5,Morbo,Pain Monster12550,Pain Monster," See you April 15th, folks!
",28,59,4,5,Nixon,Nixon12551,Nixon," Cue the fireworks guy!  Incidentally, tonight's Freedom Day celebration is brought to you by ...  ... ""Shankman's Rubbing Compound"".  When something needs rubbing, think ""Shankman"".
",183,59,4,5,Pain Monster,Bender12552,Bender," Yay! Shankman!
",16,59,4,5,Nixon,Hermes12553,Hermes," It costs a little more but it's worth it!
",43,59,4,5,Bender,Nixon12554,Nixon," Our planet has been through so much this past year: Wars, droughts, impeachments! But we've never lost our sense of what's truly important: The great taste of ""Charleston Chew""!  And now, let us salute that beloved symbol of freedom, our flag, Ol' Freebie!
",258,59,4,5,Hermes,Zoidberg12555,Zoidberg," I'm swelling with patriotic mucus!
",36,59,4,5,Nixon,Nixon12556,Nixon," In our darkest hour we can stand erect, with proud, upthrust bosoms!
",70,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Fry12557,Fry," Anyone who laughs is a Communist!
",35,59,4,5,Nixon,Nixon12558,Nixon," Knowing that, with a shifty glance skyward, we will see by the rocket's red glare that our flag is still there.  It's gone!
",125,59,4,5,Fry,Zoidberg12559,Zoidberg," Yes, fellow patriots, I ate your flag. And I did it with pride. For to express oneself with doing a thing is the very essence of Freedom Day! Bless this planet and all its wonderful people!
",191,59,4,5,Nixon,Nixon12560,Nixon,"  Kill him! Kill the traitor!
",30,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Man #112561,Man #1," Hey, it's the guy who desecrated our flag!
",44,59,4,5,Nixon,Nixon12562,Nixon," Stop that red menace!
",23,59,4,5,Man #1,Zoidberg12563,Zoidberg," I'm all scuttled out!  Huh? My planet's embassy? They're paid to not kill me! A-yoop!
",87,59,4,5,Nixon,Zoidberg12564,Zoidberg," I thought I understood this world. I thought I was fitting in. But I guess I don't belong on here anymore than I belong on our crappy home planet-- Ooh, sorry.
",161,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Decapodian Man #112565,Decapodian Man #1," What sorry? Our planet stinks, we all know it.
",48,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Ambassador Mervin12566,Ambassador Mervin," Enough with the persecution, I'm saying. Zoidberg, as Ambassador, I promise you the full support of our government, already.
",126,59,4,5,Decapodian Man #1,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #112567,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1," Poor boy. You want maybe a nice mug cocoa?
",44,59,4,5,Ambassador Mervin,Zoidberg12568,Zoidberg," Ambassador Mervin, you and your staff are so kind. I'm truly humbled.  What, no marshmallows?
",95,59,4,5,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1,Nixon12569,Nixon," Let's storm the place ... without my prior knowledge.
",55,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Bender12570,Bender," Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train, step aside. You too, fatso. Freedom!
",79,59,4,5,Nixon,Leela12571,Leela," Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag. You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow offensive. But the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Earth Constitution.
",241,59,4,5,Bender,Nixon12572,Nixon," Aroo! Maybe so. But I know a place where the Constitution doesn't mean squat.
",79,59,4,5,Leela,Myrtle Fu12573,Myrtle Fu," The Supreme Court hereby accepts the case of Earth vs. Zoidberg.
",66,59,4,5,Nixon,Nixon12574,Nixon," Sock it to 'em!
",17,59,4,5,Myrtle Fu,Crowd12575,Crowd,"  Two, four, six, eight,
Eating the flag is bad.
",49,59,4,5,Nixon,Scout Leader12576,Scout Leader," Now your noose knot has exactly seven twists.
",47,59,4,5,Crowd,Man #1 #212577,Man #1 #2,"  You can eat my dog. You can eat my truck.
But you eat my flag and you're outta luck!
She's a-wavin' proud around the world, from Dallas to Fort Worth.
Let me say it again...
",176,59,4,5,Scout Leader,Crowd12578,Crowd,"  Don't mess with Earth!
",25,59,4,5,Man #1 #2,Fry12579,Fry," They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.
",30,59,4,5,Crowd,Bender12580,Bender," Pft. Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool.
",56,59,4,5,Fry,Fry12581,Fry," Where are we ever going to find a lawyer to take his case?
",60,59,4,5,Bender,Leela12582,Leela," I'll ask the head of the ACLU -- once he's done singing.
",58,59,4,5,Fry,Man #1 #212583,Man #1 #2,"  Don't mess with Earth.  Kill Zoidberg! Goodnight!
",52,59,4,5,Leela,Old Man #1 Waterfall12584,Old Man #1 Waterfall," Howdy there! I'm a lawyer and I'd like to help your friend out of his pickle.
",79,59,4,5,Man #1 #2,Fry12585,Fry," Who are you, old man?
",23,59,4,5,Old Man #1 Waterfall,Old Man #1 Waterfall12586,Old Man #1 Waterfall," Name's Old Man Waterfall but most folks just call me ""Old Man"".
",65,59,4,5,Fry,Fry12587,Fry," I'll never remember that.
",27,59,4,5,Old Man #1 Waterfall,Old Man #1 Waterfall12588,Old Man #1 Waterfall," I'm a veteran of three dozen wars. Name a body part and a planet and I've taken a bullet in it, on it. All to keep our flag flying free.
",138,59,4,5,Fry,Bender12589,Bender," And you wanna defend Zoidberg? Are you familiar with the old robot saying ""does not compute""?
",95,59,4,5,Old Man #1 Waterfall,Old Man #1 Waterfall12590,Old Man #1 Waterfall," Son, to me a robot's just a garbage can with sparks comin' out it.
",68,59,4,5,Bender,Bender12591,Bender,"  The sparks keep me warm.
",27,59,4,5,Old Man #1 Waterfall,Old Man #1 Waterfall12592,Old Man #1 Waterfall," I don't condone what Dr. Zoidberg did but I'll fight tooth and nail for his freedom to do it. Or I would if I hadn't lost my teeth and nails on Mars and Saturn respectively.
",175,59,4,5,Bender,Fry12593,Fry," Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!
",38,59,4,5,Old Man #1 Waterfall,Fry12594,Fry," You OK there in the embassy, Zoidberg?
",40,59,4,5,Fry,Holo-Zoidberg12595,Holo-Zoidberg," No. There's no cocoa marshmallows, and every night the rats eat a little more of my foot!
",91,59,4,5,Fry,Bailiff12596,Bailiff," Oyez, oyez, oyez. All rise for the Honourable Chief Justice, Myrtle Fu, and the Associate Justices.
",101,59,4,5,Holo-Zoidberg,Myrtle Fu12597,Myrtle Fu," Counsel, you may address the court on behalf of Earth, if you're ready.
",73,59,4,5,Bailiff,Hyper-Chicken12598,Hyper-Chicken," I was hatched ready! Honourable judge heads, yonder crawdad done ate up our flag.
",83,59,4,5,Myrtle Fu,Holo-Zoidberg12599,Holo-Zoidberg," I was doing freedom of speech, Earth's most sacred right.
",59,59,4,5,Hyper-Chicken,Hyper-Chicken12600,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, freedom of speech applies to what comes out of a mouth, not what goes in.
",88,59,4,5,Holo-Zoidberg,OConnor12601,OConnor," Can counsel cite precedent?
",29,59,4,5,Hyper-Chicken,Hyper-Chicken12602,Hyper-Chicken," Uh, yes, darlin', I can. In State Of Alabama vs. Giant Space Iguana, chewin' the corners off the Constitution was deemed non-protected speech.
",144,59,4,5,OConnor,Souter12603,Souter," He shut you up, O'Connor.
",27,59,4,5,Hyper-Chicken,Myrtle Fu12604,Myrtle Fu," Mr. Waterfall, you may now present arguments on behalf of Dr. Zoidberg.
",73,59,4,5,Souter,Holo-Zoidberg12605,Holo-Zoidberg," Oh, God, I'm nervous. Two of my three hearts are having attacks.
",66,59,4,5,Myrtle Fu,Bender12606,Bender," Court's kinda fun when it's not my ass on the line! Nachos?
",61,59,4,5,Holo-Zoidberg,Old Man #1 Waterfall12607,Old Man #1 Waterfall," Oh, land-o-Goshen! Your Honours, I'm not some slick, big-city lawyer like my opponent here.  But I am a veteran who has fought for his planet. You see this hand of mine?
",171,59,4,5,Bender,Scalia12608,Scalia," Yes, I do.
",12,59,4,5,Old Man #1 Waterfall,Old Man #1 Waterfall12609,Old Man #1 Waterfall," No, you don't  'Cause I lost my real hand plantin' the flag when we took back Halley's Comet! Yet it was worth it, so much do I love that flag.  I love it even more than I love my seven wives -- that's right, I'm a polygamist.  Yet I would gladly eat a flag myself, had I not used my intestine as a rope to hoist a flag made of my own skin, if it would protect the freedoms of the proud people who salute that flag.  Freedom such as polygamy.  I rest my case.  Whoa, jeez!
",474,59,4,5,Scalia,Myrtle Fu12610,Myrtle Fu," The Justices and I will now confer using high-speed telepathy.  By a vote of six-to-three, we find that flag eating is not protected by the Constitution.
",155,59,4,5,Old Man #1 Waterfall,Bender12611,Bender," Six-to-three? I beat the spread!
",34,59,4,5,Myrtle Fu,Myrtle Fu12612,Myrtle Fu," The court orders an immediate public apology.
",47,59,4,5,Bender,Holo-Zoidberg12613,Holo-Zoidberg," Apology accepted. Just don't let it happen again.
",51,59,4,5,Myrtle Fu,Hermes12614,Hermes," She means you, you turkey of the sea!
",39,59,4,5,Holo-Zoidberg,Holo-Zoidberg12615,Holo-Zoidberg," Me? Apologise? Never! I came to this planet to learn the meaning of freedom, but I say it's you who should get a nice lesson! So do your worst because no punishment could be worse than denying my freedom.
",206,59,4,5,Hermes,Myrtle Fu12616,Myrtle Fu," You are hereby sentenced to death.
",36,59,4,5,Holo-Zoidberg,Holo-Zoidberg12617,Holo-Zoidberg," Wait, let me finish!
",22,59,4,5,Myrtle Fu,Myrtle Fu12618,Myrtle Fu," Also, in a rare double-whammy decision, the court finds polygamy constitutional.
",82,59,4,5,Holo-Zoidberg,Old Man #1 Waterfall12619,Old Man #1 Waterfall," I can't wait to tell my husband!
",34,59,4,5,Myrtle Fu,Zapp12620,Zapp," Remember, men, take him alive so there's something left to kill.
",66,59,4,5,Old Man #1 Waterfall,Ambassador Mervin12621,Ambassador Mervin," Stay back! This embassy is sovereign mud of the mud planet Decapod 10. Invading these mud premises is an act of war.
",118,59,4,5,Zapp,Zapp12622,Zapp," Yeah? Well what are you going to do about it, Shrimp-y?
",57,59,4,5,Ambassador Mervin,Ambassador Mervin12623,Ambassador Mervin," You wanna see, Mr. Big-Shot?  Attack Earth.  Yes I know it's a schlep. Just do it!
",84,59,4,5,Zapp,Zoidberg12624,Zoidberg," Aha! Now the rubber band's on the other claw!
",47,59,4,5,Ambassador Mervin,Zapp12625,Zapp," Ready ... retreat!
",20,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Patron12626,Patron,"  Shh!
",7,59,4,5,Zapp,Zoidberg12627,Zoidberg," Deny my freedom, will you? Well we'll do to you what we did to the Squash Men of the Squash Planet! Squish them!
",114,59,4,5,Patron,Ambassador Mervin12628,Ambassador Mervin," Charleston Chew?
",18,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg12629,Zoidberg," You bet!
",10,59,4,5,Ambassador Mervin,Zapp12630,Zapp," Alright, Kif, let's show these freaks what a bloated, runaway military budget can do. Bring me the activation codes for our global defence network.
",149,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Kif12631,Kif,"  Aye, aye, sir.
",17,59,4,5,Zapp,Computer Voice12632,Computer Voice," Commence lip identification scan.  No tongue.
",47,59,4,5,Kif,Zapp12633,Zapp," We can't be too careful with these codes. Rumour has it a double agent may be aboard this very ship.  I'm watching you! You, ensign, what's your name?
",152,59,4,5,Computer Voice,Ensign12634,Ensign," Hugh Man, sir.
",16,59,4,5,Zapp,Zapp12635,Zapp," Hugh Man? Now that's a name I can trust. Run down to the central battle computer and enter these codes. Chop, chop!
",117,59,4,5,Ensign,Kif12636,Kif," Um, sir? There's something about that ensign that's--
",55,59,4,5,Zapp,Zapp12637,Zapp," You're damn right there is! That strapping young lad's gunning for your job. And he just might get it.
",104,59,4,5,Kif,Zapp12638,Zapp," The enemy approacheth! Lieutenant, fire missile one and recommend me for another medal. Make it gaudy, I'm going clubbing later.  Tick, tock!
",143,59,4,5,Zapp,Kif12639,Kif," Sir, all planetary defences have been disabled. Perhaps the Decapodians acquired our secret codes, somehow.
",109,59,4,5,Zapp,Zapp12640,Zapp," Well, Kif, stand by to take the blame. Steady, steady ... now!
",64,59,4,5,Kif,Leela12641,Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave all of Earth?
",80,59,4,5,Zapp,Zoidberg12642,Zoidberg," Bah! Your planet doesn't deserve freedom until it learns what it is to not have freedom. It's a lesson, I say.
",112,59,4,5,Leela,Fry12643,Fry," Ow!
",5,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Bender12644,Bender," What the hell is this dirt pile we're building, anyhow?
",57,59,4,5,Fry,Zoidberg12645,Zoidberg," None of your beeswax, slave! You'll find out soon enough. Just focus on globing that mud.  Glob!
",98,59,4,5,Bender,Fry12646,Fry," I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school. Y'know, to become a barber?
",95,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Leela12647,Leela," This can't go on. Today is the day we fight back!
",51,59,4,5,Fry,Bender12648,Bender," It's already 10 o'clock!
",26,59,4,5,Leela,Leela12649,Leela," Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back.
",54,59,4,5,Bender,Zapp12650,Zapp," Yeah? Well good luck, sister. All our modern technology is useless.
",69,59,4,5,Leela,Bender12651,Bender," I know I am.
",14,59,4,5,Zapp,Fry12652,Fry," Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know, a headache with pictures?
",80,59,4,5,Bender,Leela12653,Leela," An idea?
",10,59,4,5,Fry,Fry12654,Fry," Back in my day we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons, but we still managed to kill each other just fine.
",114,59,4,5,Leela,Bender12655,Bender," Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 15th century.
",88,59,4,5,Fry,Fry12656,Fry," Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you could commit a war crime with--
",115,59,4,5,Bender,Bender12657,Bender," Wow!  Ow!
",11,59,4,5,Fry,Ambassador Mervin12658,Ambassador Mervin," Earth slaves, behold the fruit of your labours: The Mobile Oppression Palace.
",79,59,4,5,Bender,Bender12659,Bender," Neat!
",7,59,4,5,Ambassador Mervin,Ambassador Mervin12660,Ambassador Mervin," I don't need to tell you that occupation forces are expensive. But with the Mobile Oppression Palace, a few dignitaries can oppress your entire planet for pennies a day.  Warships, dismissed!
",193,59,4,5,Bender,Old Man #1 Waterfall12661,Old Man #1 Waterfall," Do your worst, you sea devils! I'll make my stand with Ol' Freebie. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!  My spirit!
",129,59,4,5,Ambassador Mervin,Frida12662,Frida," Great Grandpa, no!  Another victim of the mano-centric male-ocracy.
",69,59,4,5,Old Man #1 Waterfall,Zoidberg12663,Zoidberg," Ambassador Mervin, you killed my lawyer.
",42,59,4,5,Frida,Ambassador Mervin12664,Ambassador Mervin," You're welcome.
",17,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg12665,Zoidberg," He defended my freedom when no one else would. He was a good and honourable man.
",82,59,4,5,Ambassador Mervin,Old Man #1 Waterfall12666,Old Man #1 Waterfall," I request a Satanic funeral.
",30,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg12667,Zoidberg," Is it possible that all this slavery and oppression is shmutzing up our freedom lesson?
",89,59,4,5,Old Man #1 Waterfall,Ambassador Mervin12668,Ambassador Mervin," Ah, take a pill, Zoidberg.  Begin again with the crushing!
",60,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Fry12669,Fry," You haven't won yet, Mervin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum, much less steal this ancient heat-seeking missile.
",126,59,4,5,Ambassador Mervin,Ambassador Mervin12670,Ambassador Mervin," I don't even know you.
",24,59,4,5,Fry,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #112671,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1," Oh, it's gonna make such a mess!
",34,59,4,5,Ambassador Mervin,Ambassador Mervin12672,Ambassador Mervin," This is your secret plan? Meh! Heat-seeking missiles are useless against the Mobile Oppression Palace. All Decapodian technology is cold-blooded, like us!
",156,59,4,5,Decapodian Woman #1 #1 #1,Zoidberg12673,Zoidberg," All eyes on Zoidberg!  Ew!
",28,59,4,5,Ambassador Mervin,Bender12674,Bender," Hey, I need that to smoke!
",28,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Fry12675,Fry," Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool.
",57,59,4,5,Bender,Zoidberg12676,Zoidberg," Wait! People of Earth, listen. Yes, I'm desecrating a flag. But to preserve the freedom it represents!
",104,59,4,5,Fry,Leela12677,Leela," Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like I could stand to hug you! I can't, but you know what I'm trying to say.
",112,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Crowd12678,Crowd,"  Zoidberg! Zoidberg! Zoidberg!
",32,59,4,5,Leela,Zoidberg12679,Zoidberg," Ah, if only they appreciated freedom this much on my home planet. Wait a second! They do! Because this is my home planet.
",123,59,4,5,Crowd,Nixon12680,Nixon," And now, to raise this beautiful new flag, a red lobster that won't ruin your dinner, Dr. John Zoidberg!
",106,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg12681,Zoidberg," You're a nice man, Nixon.
",27,59,4,5,Nixon,Scoop Chang12682,Scoop Chang," Dr. Zoidberg, how's about you take a bite of the flag for tomorrow's papers?
",78,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg12683,Zoidberg," Oh, I couldn't.
",17,59,4,5,Scoop Chang,Nixon12684,Nixon," No, no, no, go ahead. You've earned it!
",41,59,4,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg12685,Zoidberg," Well, maybe just a taste.  Mmm! Now that's a grand, old flag!  I wonder what the Shroud of Turin tastes like.
",111,59,4,5,Nixon,John DiMaggio12686,John DiMaggio," Wooo!  Two, three! 
",21,60,4,6,Zoidberg,Farnsworth12687,Farnsworth," Oh, my.
",9,60,4,6,John DiMaggio,Bender12688,Bender," Here we go, y'all!
",20,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Zoidberg12689,Zoidberg," Zoidberg...Zoidberg...Z-Z-Z-Z-Zoidberg. 
",42,60,4,6,Bender,Bender12690,Bender," This is a story about all my friends!
",39,60,4,6,Zoidberg,Farnsworth12691,Farnsworth," Fry?
",6,60,4,6,Bender,Fry12692,Fry," Unh!!
",7,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth12693,Farnsworth," Fry?
",6,60,4,6,Fry,Announcer #112694,Announcer #1,"  Previously on All My Circuits...
",35,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Antonio12695,Antonio,"  I'm sorry, Father. But, somewhere along the way, I forgot how to be your son.
",80,60,4,6,Announcer #1,Calculon12696,Calculon,"  Why, Antonio?
",16,60,4,6,Antonio,Antonio12697,Antonio,"  Because ... I have amnesia!
",30,60,4,6,Calculon,Monique12698,Monique,"  Calculon? But I thought you were--
",37,60,4,6,Antonio,Calculon12699,Calculon,"  Egyptian?
",12,60,4,6,Monique,Monique12700,Monique,"  Before I kill you, I must ask you one question: Who am I? For I have ... amnesia!
",84,60,4,6,Calculon,Calculon12701,Calculon,"  Let me get this straight: Does anyone here not have amnesia?
",63,60,4,6,Monique,Monique12702,Monique,"  Not sure.
",12,60,4,6,Calculon,Human Friend12703,Human Friend,"  I 'unno.
",11,60,4,6,Monique,Cubert12704,Cubert," This show is awesome! When I grow up I'm gonna have so much amnesia!
",70,60,4,6,Human Friend,Dwight12705,Dwight," Me too. I mean, I have it now, but I forgot.
",46,60,4,6,Cubert,Cubert12706,Cubert," Well, mine's louder!
",22,60,4,6,Dwight,Bender12707,Bender," Cram a ham in it, you twerps!  Sorry!
",39,60,4,6,Cubert,Fry12708,Fry," Nah, I had it coming.

",24,60,4,6,Leela,Dwight12715,Dwight," Hold up, Cubert. You're a clone of the Professor. Do clones even have birthdays?

",16,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth12721,Farnsworth," Ah, yes. It was 13 years ago next week.  I used this very fork.

",206,60,4,6,Calculon,Calculon12779,Calculon," That was so terrible I think you gave me cancer! I don't care how popular you are. You will never work on my show!
",116,60,4,6,Bender,Fry12780,Fry,"  Yay, Bender!
",15,60,4,6,Calculon,Leela12781,Leela,"  We demand Bender!
",20,60,4,6,Fry,Calculon12782,Calculon," However, you've got the job. Welcome aboard, son!
",51,60,4,6,Leela,Bender12783,Bender," Father-o!
",11,60,4,6,Calculon,Calculon12784,Calculon," Bender, I'd like you to meet our director ...  ... whose name I never learned.
",80,60,4,6,Bender,Bender12785,Bender," Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire.
",94,60,4,6,Calculon,Director #112786,Director #1," Uh, don't worry about the script, baby. We re-wrote your part to better suit your acting abilities.
",101,60,4,6,Bender,Bender12787,Bender," So now my character has a British accent?
",43,60,4,6,Director #1,Director #112788,Director #1," No, now your character's in a coma. Get in bed and don't move.  And ... action!
",81,60,4,6,Bender,Bender12789,Bender,"  Stupid dumb coma ... coulda been British.
",44,60,4,6,Director #1,Calculon12790,Calculon," Alas that mine only son should sink into an irreversible, permanent ... coma.
",79,60,4,6,Bender,Bender12791,Bender,"  Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' up.
",77,60,4,6,Calculon,Calculon12792,Calculon," Curse the tragic wildebeest accident that--
",45,60,4,6,Bender,Bender12793,Bender," Hey, everyone! Antonio here, but you can call me ""Bender""! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut.  C'mon, baby!  Come on!
",128,60,4,6,Calculon,Calculon12794,Calculon," I'm not familiar with the type of thing I'm seeing.
",53,60,4,6,Bender,Bender12795,Bender," Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!
",66,60,4,6,Calculon,Director #112796,Director #1,"  Cut!  That's the worst coma acting I've ever seen. We'll have to shoot it again.
",83,60,4,6,Bender,Calculon12797,Calculon," No! No, no, no. I don't do two takes.
",39,60,4,6,Director #1,Director #112798,Director #1," But this guy was--
",20,60,4,6,Calculon,Calculon12799,Calculon," Amateurs like you do two takes. I do one take. Print it. I'll be in my three-storey trailer.
",94,60,4,6,Director #1,Bender12800,Bender,"  Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!
",67,60,4,6,Calculon,Bender12801,Bender," Now that's hospital dancing.  Pretty good, eh, Calcky?
",56,60,4,6,Bender,Calculon12802,Calculon," Good? I've seen better acting from extras in Godzilla movies.  I don't even remember shooting this scene.
",107,60,4,6,Bender,Director #112803,Director #1," We didn't. That's security camera footage from your dressing room.
",68,60,4,6,Calculon,Calculon12804,Calculon," He stole the scene and my money? That's it! I demand you fire this felonious ham!
",83,60,4,6,Director #1,Director #112805,Director #1," The network Execubots are coming!
",35,60,4,6,Calculon,Calculon12806,Calculon," Oh, dear God!
",15,60,4,6,Director #1,Betabot12807,Betabot," Presenting the president of the network.
",42,60,4,6,Calculon,Network President12808,Network President," Greetings, gentlemen. You already know my Execubots: Executive Alpha, programmed to like things it has seen before.
",117,60,4,6,Betabot,Alphabot12809,Alphabot," Hey, hey, hey.
",16,60,4,6,Network President,Network President12810,Network President," Executive Beta, programmed to roll dice to determine the fall schedule.
",73,60,4,6,Alphabot,Betabot12811,Betabot," More reality shows.
",21,60,4,6,Network President,Network President12812,Network President," And Executive Gamma, programmed to underestimate middle America.
",66,60,4,6,Betabot,Gammabot12813,Gammabot," It's funny but is it going to get them off their tractors?
",60,60,4,6,Network President,Network President12814,Network President," Now, who put this obnoxious, dancing robot on my network?
",59,60,4,6,Gammabot,Director #112815,Director #1," We were about to fire him, sir.
",33,60,4,6,Network President,Network President12816,Network President," Silence, hack! We've been monitoring our Nielsen families carefully. And during the 12 seconds Bender was on screen, viewer eyeball focus was up 90%.
",151,60,4,6,Director #1,Calculon12817,Calculon," But, sir, children watch this show. Bender's no role model, he's a filth monger!
",82,60,4,6,Network President,Network President12818,Network President," At our network, we love filth! Filthy rich, that is! Being filthy rich, that is!  ""Bite my shiny metal ass"" could be a catchphrase.
",133,60,4,6,Calculon,Alphabot12819,Alphabot," 80% likely.
",13,60,4,6,Network President,Gammabot12820,Gammabot," It will play in Peoria.
",25,60,4,6,Alphabot,Betabot12821,Betabot," Gameshows are back.
",21,60,4,6,Gammabot,Network President12822,Network President," We need this edgy, sweeps-ready robot on our network. Bender? Can you continue to drink, smoke and steal things on TV?
",120,60,4,6,Betabot,Bender12823,Bender," Yes, I can.
",13,60,4,6,Network President,Tinny Tim12824,Tinny Tim," Yeah! Shooting!
",17,60,4,6,Bender,Dwight12825,Dwight," Alright!
",10,60,4,6,Tinny Tim,Dwight12826,Dwight," Yo! Check out what I jacked from my dad.
",42,60,4,6,Dwight,Cubert12827,Cubert," A cigar!
",10,60,4,6,Dwight,Tinny Tim12828,Tinny Tim," Ripping!
",10,60,4,6,Cubert,Dwight12829,Dwight," Look! I'm Bender!
",19,60,4,6,Tinny Tim,Hermes12830,Hermes," Ras H. Tafari! What's goin' on here?
",38,60,4,6,Dwight,Farnsworth12831,Farnsworth," The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.
",41,60,4,6,Hermes,Hermes12832,Hermes," That's not a cigar. Uh ... and it's not mine!
",47,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Cubert12833,Cubert," Hey, Dad! Bite my shiny metal ass!
",36,60,4,6,Hermes,Farnsworth12834,Farnsworth," What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us! Where did you learn such language?
",98,60,4,6,Cubert,Tinny Tim12835,Tinny Tim," From Bender, my good jerkwad.
",31,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Hermes12836,Hermes," Bender, eh? That guy's really startin' to twist my dreads.
",60,60,4,6,Tinny Tim,Bender12837,Bender," OK, OK, OK. Get ready for this part.
",38,60,4,6,Hermes,Zoidberg12838,Zoidberg," Quiet, robot! Bender's on TV.
",31,60,4,6,Bender,Monique12839,Monique,"  Oh, Calculon, it's so good to get away from the city and that beastly, yet intriguing, Bender.
",97,60,4,6,Zoidberg,Bender12840,Bender,"  Try this, kids at home!
",26,60,4,6,Monique,Linda12841,Linda,"  Is television sensation Bender a bad role model for Earth children?
",70,60,4,6,Bender,Bender12842,Bender," That's crazy!
",15,60,4,6,Linda,Linda12843,Linda,"  A new protest group, Fathers Against Rude Television, says ""Hell, yes!""
",74,60,4,6,Bender,Fry12844,Fry," Pft! What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group?
",61,60,4,6,Linda,Farnsworth12845,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group.
",72,60,4,6,Fry,Zoidberg12846,Zoidberg," That was uncanny.
",19,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Hermes12847,Hermes," Fathers Against Rude Television don't want our kids watching Bender's high-definition filth.
",94,60,4,6,Zoidberg,Farnsworth12848,Farnsworth," And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? That's not what F-A-R-T is all about.
",79,60,4,6,Hermes,Hermes12849,Hermes," No, sir! Not us FARTers.
",26,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Bender12850,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model.
",84,60,4,6,Hermes,Leela12851,Leela," As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.
",100,60,4,6,Bender,Fry12852,Fry," Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
",51,60,4,6,Leela,Cubert12853,Cubert," Our dads are all pumped up on dork-osterone. We're just trying to be cool, like Bender.
",89,60,4,6,Fry,Dwight12854,Dwight," Yeah, and it's not even working. Smoking and drinking make us barf.
",69,60,4,6,Cubert,Tinny Tim12855,Tinny Tim," Gentle jerkwads. I know how to emulate Bender without barfing. We could commit a burglary.
",92,60,4,6,Dwight,Dwight12856,Dwight," Hey, yeah!
",12,60,4,6,Tinny Tim,Cubert12857,Cubert," Bender loves to burgle!
",25,60,4,6,Dwight,Dwight12858,Dwight," Hold up, though. Who could we rob? We don't even know anyone with cool stuff.
",79,60,4,6,Cubert,Cubert12859,Cubert," Duh! We know someone who runs on pure cool fuel: Bender!
",58,60,4,6,Dwight,Dwight12860,Dwight," Whoa!
",7,60,4,6,Cubert,Tinny Tim12861,Tinny Tim," We'll rob Bender!
",19,60,4,6,Dwight,Dwight12862,Dwight," TV gave us the idea.
",22,60,4,6,Tinny Tim,Bender12863,Bender,"  You're watching Futurama, the show that does not advocate the cool crime of robbery.
",87,60,4,6,Dwight,Cubert12864,Cubert," OK. It's crime time.
",22,60,4,6,Bender,Fry12865,Fry," Hey, Bender.  Hey, Bender.  Hey, Bender.  Hey, Bender.
",56,60,4,6,Cubert,Farnsworth12866,Farnsworth," What's going on in here?  Oh. Now I'm really outraged.
",56,60,4,6,Fry,Hermes12867,Hermes," Where did you requisition this party? And Zoidberg, what are you doing here?
",78,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Zoidberg12868,Zoidberg," I'm networking. Let me give you my card.
",42,60,4,6,Hermes,Cubert12869,Cubert," Relax, Dad. We just invited a few friends over.
",49,60,4,6,Zoidberg,Farnsworth12870,Farnsworth," Hmm. There's something wrong with your story but I can't put my finger on it.  Of course! You don't have friends!
",115,60,4,6,Cubert,Hermes12871,Hermes," Yeah. Why do these popular kids consider you cool all of a sudden?
",68,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Dwight12872,Dwight," Um ... we're just cool, is all!
",33,60,4,6,Hermes,Farnsworth12873,Farnsworth," Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's cool, using the cool-o-meter!
",70,60,4,6,Dwight,Cool-o-Meter12874,Cool-o-Meter," Oh, yeah!
",11,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth12875,Farnsworth," Good Lord! I'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies.
",59,60,4,6,Cool-o-Meter,Hermes12876,Hermes," Everybody out!
",16,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Zoidberg12877,Zoidberg," So, do you guys know about anything else going on, because I'm totally still ready to party.
",94,60,4,6,Hermes,Hermes12878,Hermes," There's enough cool stuff here to furnish a happenin' pad. Where did it all come from?
",88,60,4,6,Zoidberg,Tinny Tim12879,Tinny Tim," Don't tell, comrades. All for one and one for all!
",52,60,4,6,Hermes,Dwight12880,Dwight," We stole it!
",14,60,4,6,Tinny Tim,Tinny Tim12881,Tinny Tim," Oh, crumb!
",12,60,4,6,Dwight,Bender12882,Bender," What? What's going on?
",24,60,4,6,Tinny Tim,Farnsworth12883,Farnsworth," I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst and coolest of crimes.
",94,60,4,6,Bender,Hermes12884,Hermes," And all from watching you on TV, you cool jerk.
",49,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Bender12885,Bender," Hey, lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender is about entertainment, baby! You can't hold me responsible for what kids do when-- Hey! This is my stuff they stole!  That's the last straw! Bender should not be allowed on television!
",271,60,4,6,Hermes,Bender12886,Bender," Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I am?  Come on! We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats!
",188,60,4,6,Bender,FART Mob12887,FART Mob,"  Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender!
",74,60,4,6,Bender,Bender12888,Bender," This mob's with me.
",21,60,4,6,FART Mob,Security Guard #112889,Security Guard #1," Go ahead.
",11,60,4,6,Bender,FART Mob12890,FART Mob,"  Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with--  Bender! Down with Bender!
",95,60,4,6,Security Guard #1,Calculon12891,Calculon," As a doctor and captain of this hospital ship, I now pronounce you man and wife with six months to live.
",106,60,4,6,FART Mob,Farnsworth12892,Farnsworth," Listen up, Hollywood. We're an exciting, new mob.
",51,60,4,6,Calculon,Bender12893,Bender," Yeah!
",7,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Hermes12894,Hermes," You'd better believe it!
",26,60,4,6,Bender,Calculon12895,Calculon," Great Shatner's ghost!
",24,60,4,6,Hermes,Bender12896,Bender," We demand that all TV's be equipped with a B-Chip that blocks Bender from appearing on the screen.
",100,60,4,6,Calculon,Farnsworth12897,Farnsworth," Booya!
",8,60,4,6,Bender,Network President12898,Network President," I'm afraid the answer is a gritty, in-your-face no.
",53,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Bender12899,Bender," Then I quit.
",14,60,4,6,Network President,Network President12900,Network President," Then you don't quit.  I think you'll be finishing the scene now, Mr. Bender. And don't skimp on the nasty.
",108,60,4,6,Bender,Farnsworth12901,Farnsworth," There'll be no further nasty.  We still have the option of resorting to violence.
",83,60,4,6,Network President,Hermes12902,Hermes," What makes you think that'll work?
",36,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth12903,Farnsworth," I saw it on TV in that episode where Bender shot Calculon. How cool was that?
",79,60,4,6,Hermes,Bender12904,Bender," Ooh, yeah! C'mon--
",20,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth12905,Farnsworth," Quit the show!
",16,60,4,6,Bender,Network President12906,Network President," Do the scene.
",15,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth12907,Farnsworth," I'm a cold-blooded punk!
",26,60,4,6,Network President,Network President12908,Network President," I once put a laugh track on a sitcom that had no jokes in it.
",63,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Bender12909,Bender," Hey, look! The prop guy has a lamp!
",37,60,4,6,Network President,Network President12910,Network President," Really?
",9,60,4,6,Bender,Farnsworth12911,Farnsworth," Wha?
",6,60,4,6,Network President,Bender12912,Bender," Aha!
",6,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth12913,Farnsworth," I was using that!
",19,60,4,6,Bender,Bender12914,Bender," Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation.
",126,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Director #112915,Director #1," You're angry.
",15,60,4,6,Bender,Bender12916,Bender," Perfect.  Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV really make me cool? Of course they do.  How 'bout committing crimes and violence? Again, the answer is ""yes"". But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV? I say absolutely not!  Uh ... on the other hand, most, perhaps all the blame, rests with the parents. That's right, you!  And so I ask you this one question: Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
",498,60,4,6,Director #1,Hermes12917,Hermes,"  We're just so busy.
",22,60,4,6,Bender,Bender12918,Bender," Well make time.
",17,60,4,6,Hermes,Director #112919,Director #1," And ... cut!
",14,60,4,6,Bender,Calculon12920,Calculon," Good enough. Splice in some reaction shots of me and shove it on the air.
",75,60,4,6,Director #1,Bender12921,Bender," Â : Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
",102,60,4,6,Calculon,Hermes12922,Hermes," Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable lesson about TV there.
",64,60,4,6,Bender,Cubert12923,Cubert," What was it?
",14,60,4,6,Hermes,Farnsworth12924,Farnsworth," Uh ... that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while.
",111,60,4,6,Cubert,Fry12925,Fry," Hear, hear!
",13,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Leela12926,Leela," Yeah!
",7,60,4,6,Fry,Bender12927,Bender," Damn right!
",13,60,4,6,Leela,Dwight12928,Dwight," So, should we turn it off now?
",32,60,4,6,Bender,Farnsworth12929,Farnsworth," Well, uh, that depends what's on.
",35,60,4,6,Dwight,Fry12930,Fry," Nothing good.
",15,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth12931,Farnsworth," Ah, let's just keep watching.
",31,60,4,6,Fry,Bender12932,Bender,"  TV party tonight!

",20,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth12935,Farnsworth," Oh!
",5,60,4,6,Bender,Fry12936,Fry,"  We've got nothing better to do.
",34,60,4,6,Farnsworth,Leela12937,Leela,"  Than watch TV and have a couple of brews!
",44,60,4,6,Fry,Zoidberg12938,Zoidberg,"  Don't wanna talk about anything else.
",40,60,4,6,Leela,Fry12939,Fry,"  We don't wanna know!
",23,60,4,6,Zoidberg,Farnsworth12940,Farnsworth,"  We're dedicated, yes!

",255,61,4,7,Bender,Fry12948,Fry," Amazing! That's why they call you ""Bender the Magnificent""!
",61,61,4,7,Bender,Bender12949,Bender," No, it isn't.
",15,61,4,7,Fry,Fry12950,Fry," Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th century pizzeria, just like the one I used to work at.
",94,61,4,7,Bender,Bender12951,Bender," Interesting. No, wait, the other thing ... tedious.
",53,61,4,7,Fry,Fry12952,Fry," Let's go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.
",66,61,4,7,Bender,Bender12953,Bender," You lived before you met me?
",30,61,4,7,Fry,Fry12954,Fry," Sure. Lots of people did.
",27,61,4,7,Bender,Bender12955,Bender," Really?
",9,61,4,7,Fry,Bender12956,Bender," Truly, they were as gods who built this place!
",48,61,4,7,Bender,Tour Guide12957,Tour Guide," Next, we come to the splendidly-preserved wooden pizza paddle.  Scientists theorise it was used to gently discipline the delivery boy.
",136,61,4,7,Bender,Fry12958,Fry," Wait a second! This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria!  And for your information, lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt. It was also used to move pizzas and crush rats.
",197,61,4,7,Tour Guide,Tour Guide12959,Tour Guide," I don't know where you get your facts, sir, but I am a volunteer housewife with 45 minutes of orientation and a Harlequin romance about archaeologists.
",153,61,4,7,Fry,Fry12960,Fry," Don't wave your fancy degrees at me! I recognise all this stuff.  Petrified sausages, old Mr. Patelli. And that's--
",117,61,4,7,Tour Guide,Man #112961,Man #1,"  Yes?
",7,61,4,7,Fry,Fry12962,Fry," Pizza delivery for Mr. ...  ... Seymour Asses.
",48,61,4,7,Man #1,Man #112963,Man #1,"  There's no one by that name here ... or anywhere. I hope that in time you'll realise what an idiot you've been.
",114,61,4,7,Fry,Fry12964,Fry," I wouldn't count on that.
",27,61,4,7,Man #1,Fry12965,Fry," Aw! Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here ...  ... but if Mr. Panucci asks, your name is Seymour Asses.  I like you, Seymour. You're not constantly judging me like all the other dogs ... are you? Nah! We understand each other.  People think you're just a dumb mutt who smells bad, can't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job. But you're keepin' it real and you call no man ""Mister"".  Well, goodbye.  Live long and prosper.
",453,61,4,7,Fry,Bender12966,Bender," Yuck! That's the least appetising calzone I've ever seen!
",59,61,4,7,Fry,Fry12967,Fry," No! That's my dog in there. It's an outrage, I say!  I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me.  Uh-oh!
",126,61,4,7,Bender,Bender12968,Bender," And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified.
",74,61,4,7,Fry,Fry12969,Fry," Well it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging up Lassie and putting her on display in the Louvre.
",125,61,4,7,Bender,Amy12970,Amy," Lassie is on display in the Louvre.
",37,61,4,7,Fry,Fry12971,Fry," I know. I was deliberately describing a similar situation.
",60,61,4,7,Amy,Farnsworth12972,Farnsworth," Why don't you try protesting? Like those native Martians; always whining that people don't treat their ancestor's bones with respect.
",135,61,4,7,Fry,Bender12973,Bender," Nah, protesting never works.
",30,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Fry12974,Fry," You're right.  I'll give it a shot!
",37,61,4,7,Bender,Crowd12975,Crowd,"  What do you want?
",20,61,4,7,Fry,Fry12976,Fry,"  Fry's dog!
",13,61,4,7,Crowd,Crowd12977,Crowd,"  When do you want it?
",23,61,4,7,Fry,Fry12978,Fry,"  Fry's dog!  I will now perform my people's native dance.
",59,61,4,7,Crowd,Leela12979,Leela," It says this part of The Hustle implores the gods to grant a favour. Usually a Trans-AM.
",90,61,4,7,Fry,Fry12980,Fry,"  I'm walking on sunshine! Oh-oh-oh!  I'm walking on sunshine! Oh-oh-oh!   That a boy, Seymour! Right here waiting for me as always. Just like that huge mushroom in my shower.
",176,61,4,7,Leela,Panucci12981,Panucci," Hey! There's our little mascot.  Aw, you been swimming in the sewer again?  You rascal!  Fry, cleanup!
",104,61,4,7,Fry,Fry12982,Fry," Seymour, cleanup!  Good dog!
",30,61,4,7,Panucci,Panucci12983,Panucci," That's a good Seymour!
",24,61,4,7,Fry,Boy12984,Boy," Yo! There's dog fur on my slice!
",34,61,4,7,Panucci,Panucci12985,Panucci," Nah, that's vermicelli! No fur in here!
",41,61,4,7,Boy,Fry12986,Fry," He's so cute! He can do two things at one time: Eat and swim. Ooh, three things!
",82,61,4,7,Panucci,Leela12987,Leela," Fry, it's been three days. You can't keep boogie-ing like this. You'll come down with a fever of some sort.
",109,61,4,7,Fry,Ben Bee #1ler12988,Ben Bee #1ler," Mr. Fry? I'm Dr. Ben Beeler, the palaeontologist who discovered your dog. Or as some call it, the ""Beelersaurus"".
",115,61,4,7,Leela,Fry12989,Fry," So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure?
",65,61,4,7,Ben Bee #1ler,Bee #1ler12990,Bee #1ler," No, we're sorry but there's just too much that fossil can teach us about dogs from your time.
",95,61,4,7,Fry,Fry12991,Fry," His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxophonist. He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus.
",170,61,4,7,Bee #1ler,Ray12992,Ray," The 29? Interesting.
",22,61,4,7,Fry,Bee #1ler12993,Bee #1ler," That's all I needed. Ray?
",27,61,4,7,Ray,Ray12994,Ray," I'm good.
",11,61,4,7,Bee #1ler,Bee #1ler12995,Bee #1ler," OK then. Here's your dog back.
",32,61,4,7,Ray,Fry12996,Fry," Seymour!
",10,61,4,7,Bee #1ler,Bender12997,Bender," Lady and gentleman! How 'bout a hand for my temporary replacement assistant?
",78,61,4,7,Fry,Zoidberg12998,Zoidberg," I was all in this part! It's magic!
",37,61,4,7,Bender,Bender12999,Bender," You are not fit to wear Fry's leotard!
",40,61,4,7,Zoidberg,Zoidberg13000,Zoidberg," Stop!
",7,61,4,7,Bender,Fry13001,Fry," Good news, everyone!
",22,61,4,7,Zoidberg,Bender13002,Bender," Hooray, he's back! And he's looking for a garbage can to put the rock in! Here you go, buddy!
",95,61,4,7,Fry,Farnsworth13003,Farnsworth," No. Actually we've discovered that Fry's dog was fast-fossilised, preserving it's cellular structure!
",103,61,4,7,Bender,Fry13004,Fry," Which means we can clone it! Seymour will live again!
",55,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Zoidberg13005,Zoidberg," A little land mammal!
",23,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13006,Fry," Can you believe it, Bender? I'm going to have my best friend back!
",68,61,4,7,Zoidberg,Cubert13007,Cubert," Why the idiot convention?
",27,61,4,7,Fry,Farnsworth13008,Farnsworth," Ah, Cubert, my precious babe. I'm going to attempt to clone Fry's dog using the very same apparatus I used to clone you.  Ooh, look! There's a smidge of toe still in here.  You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy, mineral shell, there's still a creamy core of dog nougat.
",271,61,4,7,Cubert,Fry13009,Fry," So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?
",59,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13010,Farnsworth," Amazingly, yes. In cases of rapid fossilisation, I can press this brain scan button, retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death.
",155,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13011,Fry," I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!
",57,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Bender13012,Bender," Crappy ineffective Reaper!
",28,61,4,7,Fry,Farnsworth13013,Farnsworth," I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from Human Mode to Dog Mode.
",67,61,4,7,Bender,Computer Voice13014,Computer Voice," The dog says--
",16,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13015,Farnsworth," Uh-oh, this may take a while.
",31,61,4,7,Computer Voice,Boy13016,Boy," You stink, loser!
",19,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Panucci13017,Panucci," Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out. C'mon!
",35,61,4,7,Boy,Fry13018,Fry," But I'm celebrating New Year's Eve.
",37,61,4,7,Panucci,Panucci13019,Panucci," Like you got squat to celebrate! You're a delivery boy this millennium and you'll be a delivery boy next millennium!  What's with Seymour? It's like he don't want you to go. Or he thinks your pants is too short, or somethin'. Which is crazy 'cause, frankly, you look fabulous. Now get goin'!
",293,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13020,Fry," I won't be gone long, Seymour. Just wait here till I come back.
",65,61,4,7,Panucci,Fry13021,Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for ...  ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!  Here's to another lousy millennium.
",95,61,4,7,Fry,Crowd13022,Crowd,"  Five, four, three, two.
",26,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13023,Fry," What the--?
",13,61,4,7,Crowd,Bender13024,Bender," A dog collar, for me?  You shouldn't have!
",44,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13025,Fry," That's for Seymour.
",21,61,4,7,Bender,Bender13026,Bender," Oh.
",5,61,4,7,Fry,Bender13027,Bender," Say, why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl?  That's not a reputable journal of opinion.
",102,61,4,7,Bender,Fry13028,Fry," Oh, that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned.
",81,61,4,7,Bender,Bender13029,Bender," Are you on the junk, Fry? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior intelligence?
",92,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13030,Fry," Hey, he was smart! He could fetch.
",36,61,4,7,Bender,Bender13031,Bender," I can fetch.
",14,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13032,Fry," He could dig up bones.
",24,61,4,7,Bender,Bender13033,Bender," Hello? Charlemagne?  Plus, I bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head.
",81,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13034,Fry," Look, Bender, this has nothing to do with you.
",48,61,4,7,Bender,Bender13035,Bender," That's impossible!
",20,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13036,Fry," Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.
",62,61,4,7,Bender,Bender13037,Bender," No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I would. A tiny little house that says ""Bender"" on it.  Ow!
",140,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13038,Fry,"  This is Fry. If you're calling about the used towels for sale, they're still available for $45 each.
",103,61,4,7,Bender,Mr. Fry13039,Mr. Fry," Phil, it's your father. Where are you? You're holding up New Year's brunch. Your brother can't wait any longer.
",113,61,4,7,Fry,Yancy13040,Yancy," Hello, first baloney of the new millennium!  Ah, here he comes. That's him and Seymour.
",89,61,4,7,Mr. Fry,Mrs. Fry13041,Mrs. Fry," Well that's weird. Seymour's here but--  Go! Go! Touchdown! But where's Philip?
",81,61,4,7,Yancy,Mr. Fry13042,Mr. Fry," I'm tellin' you, the Y2K computer's got him. We'll face burnin' roads, rivers exploding, calculators transformed into Scud missiles. There's nothing we can do.  What's that, Seymour? You walking on sunshine?
",209,61,4,7,Mrs. Fry,Yancy13043,Yancy," He's trying to tell us something. Maybe he can lead us to Philip.
",67,61,4,7,Mr. Fry,Yancy13044,Yancy," Should we follow him?
",23,61,4,7,Yancy,Mr. Fry13045,Mr. Fry," To our deaths? Negatory.
",26,61,4,7,Yancy,Mr. Fry13046,Mr. Fry," It's the Y2K tryin' to lure us into an ambush. And I ain't buyin' it. Pass the baloney.
",89,61,4,7,Mr. Fry,Fry13047,Fry," Are you two gonna be done soon?
",33,61,4,7,Mr. Fry,Leela13048,Leela," Sorry, but we need to practise hand-to-hand combat in case an enemy knocks the laser guns out of our hands and they slide way across the room.
",144,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13049,Fry," Well could you do it some place else? I'm setting up Seymour's doggy bed.
",75,61,4,7,Leela,Leela13050,Leela," OK.
",5,61,4,7,Fry,Bender13051,Bender," Heel, boy, heel! Oh, hello, Fry! I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such fun with my new best friend, Robo-Puppy.
",126,61,4,7,Leela,Fry13052,Fry,"  That's nice.
",15,61,4,7,Bender,Bender13053,Bender," I was just out walking him. Yes, you can walk him. Of course, after he goes you have to refill the canisters. C'mere, boy! Pet, pet, pet.
",139,61,4,7,Fry,Robo-Puppy13054,Robo-Puppy," Robo-Puppy receiving petting.
",31,61,4,7,Bender,Amy13055,Amy," Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy? That's so adorable!
",61,61,4,7,Robo-Puppy,Bender13056,Bender," Jealous?  Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek.
",84,61,4,7,Amy,Robo-Puppy13057,Robo-Puppy," Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek.  Robo-Puppy commencing cheek-licking. Licking in progress. Licking complete.
",114,61,4,7,Bender,Bender13058,Bender," Robo-Puppy truly is robot's best friend, huh?
",47,61,4,7,Robo-Puppy,Fry13059,Fry," Ah, there! Perfect!
",21,61,4,7,Bender,Holo-Farnsworth13060,Holo-Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! The Clone-O-Mat is ready!
",48,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13061,Fry," Finally!
",10,61,4,7,Holo-Farnsworth,Robo-Puppy13062,Robo-Puppy," Robo-Puppy commencing two-hour yipping session.  Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert! Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert!
",112,61,4,7,Fry,Farnsworth13063,Farnsworth," Behold once more, the mighty Clone-O-Mat! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself.  I speak, of course, of molten lava deep within the Earth's core. To the sub-basement!
",232,61,4,7,Robo-Puppy,Farnsworth13064,Farnsworth," Powering up Clone-O-Mat.  Placing fossil on the Plat-Clone-O-Form.  Initiating dog brain CAT scan.
",100,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Fry13065,Fry," Come on, boy! Come back to life!
",34,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13066,Farnsworth," Know ye now what feels like to be dog god! Commencing DNA extraction.
",71,61,4,7,Fry,Bender13067,Bender," Fry, c'mon, the talent show!
",30,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Fry13068,Fry," What? I'm in the middle of something.
",39,61,4,7,Bender,Bender13069,Bender," But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?
",60,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13070,Fry," Bender, enough! Leave me alone!
",33,61,4,7,Bender,Bender13071,Bender," So that's how it is, huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog so much, maybe you'd rather play fetch!
",122,61,4,7,Fry,Leela13072,Leela," No!
",5,61,4,7,Bender,Zoidberg13073,Zoidberg," Oh!
",5,61,4,7,Leela,Bender13074,Bender," Now I'm all you got!
",22,61,4,7,Zoidberg,Fry13075,Fry," I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man!  Ow!
",50,61,4,7,Bender,Bender13076,Bender," So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.
",56,61,4,7,Fry,Farnsworth13077,Farnsworth," Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive.
",47,61,4,7,Bender,Fry13078,Fry," May yet? Really?
",18,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13079,Farnsworth," Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite; The tough black mineral that won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's affect on this ice swan.  Of course, that would have melted even at room temperature. I just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite, there's a slim chance it might have survived.
",377,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13080,Fry," So Seymour might still exist?
",31,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13081,Farnsworth," Perhaps, for a few minutes. It's dolomite, baby!
",50,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13082,Fry," Then I'm goin' in after him.
",30,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Amy13083,Amy,"  No!
",6,61,4,7,Fry,Leela13084,Leela,"  Stop!
",8,61,4,7,Amy,Fry13085,Fry," He'd come after me!
",21,61,4,7,Leela,Leela13086,Leela," Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back.
",48,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13087,Fry," Then all hope is lost.  Goodbye, Seymour.
",43,61,4,7,Leela,Bender13088,Bender," Please stop crying, Fry. Here.  I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog to toy with my emotions. Oh, what have I done?
",131,61,4,7,Fry,Zoidberg13089,Zoidberg," You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up.
",49,61,4,7,Bender,Bender13090,Bender," Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature, because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty.  I'm goin' in!
",257,61,4,7,Zoidberg,Farnsworth13091,Farnsworth," I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite.
",149,61,4,7,Bender,Bender13092,Bender," I'm 40% dolomite!  Oh, it's hot! It's very hot!
",49,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Cryogenicist13093,Cryogenicist," Ugh! I am one hungover cryogenisist. Just throw that mutt in the freezer till his owners get here.
",100,61,4,7,Bender,Plumber13094,Plumber," You can't solve all your problems by freezing them, boss.
",59,61,4,7,Cryogenicist,Cryogenicist13095,Cryogenicist," I think you're forgetting our motto.
",38,61,4,7,Plumber,Mr. Fry13096,Mr. Fry," Are you the cryogenisist who called about our son's dog?
",58,61,4,7,Cryogenicist,Cryogenicist13097,Cryogenicist," Oh, you must be the Frys. Yeah, he's right over there.
",56,61,4,7,Mr. Fry,Mrs. Fry13098,Mrs. Fry," Sorry we're late. We all got sick from eating bad baloney.
",60,61,4,7,Cryogenicist,Mr. Fry13099,Mr. Fry," Y2K!
",6,61,4,7,Mrs. Fry,Mrs. Fry13100,Mrs. Fry," What's he so worked up about?
",31,61,4,7,Mr. Fry,Mr. Fry13101,Mr. Fry," He's just upset 'cause our boy's missing.  C'mon, you overgrown rat. Lead us to Philip.
",89,61,4,7,Mrs. Fry,Leela13102,Leela," Bender's been down there too long. I'm going in after him.
",60,61,4,7,Mr. Fry,Farnsworth13103,Farnsworth," Professor! Lava! Hot!
",23,61,4,7,Leela,Fry13104,Fry," This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back.  Bender!
",97,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Bender13105,Bender," And that is why they call me Bender the Magnificent!  Hey, where'd everybody go?
",82,61,4,7,Fry,Bender13106,Bender," OK! Let's clone us some dog!
",30,61,4,7,Bender,Fry13107,Fry," Yeah!
",7,61,4,7,Bender,Farnsworth13108,Farnsworth," Very well. Let this abomination unto the Lord begin!  Interesting. It seems Seymour died at the ripe old age of 15.
",117,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13109,Fry," 15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?
",61,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13110,Farnsworth," Indeed.
",9,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13111,Fry," Stop the cloning.
",19,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13112,Farnsworth," Oh, sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!
",42,61,4,7,Fry,Bender13113,Bender," Fry, what's wrong?
",20,61,4,7,Farnsworth,Fry13114,Fry," Think about it: Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably even added new songs to his repertoire.
",113,61,4,7,Bender,Bender13115,Bender," But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!
",61,61,4,7,Fry,Fry13116,Fry," I had Seymour till he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved him.  I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long, long time ago.
",150,61,4,7,Bender,Zoidberg13117,Zoidberg," Hurry up with the water. I'm steaming inside my own shell, I am. It's that hot, it is!
",88,62,4,8,Fry,Leela13118,Leela," Hi-yah!
",9,62,4,8,Zoidberg,Fry13119,Fry," Man, it's hot!  How hot is it?  It's so hot, I poured McDonald's coffee in my lap to cool off.  Johnny Carson said it.
",120,62,4,8,Leela,Leela13120,Leela," No, Nibbler! Don't drink the pool water! It's full of chlorine!
",65,62,4,8,Fry,Bender13121,Bender," Lightweights! Oh, wait, chlorine!
",35,62,4,8,Leela,Farnsworth13122,Farnsworth," Perhaps this movie will help us take our minds off the heat.
",62,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13123,Bender,"  Focus!
",9,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Narrator13124,Narrator,"  Global Warming Or: None Like It Hot!
",39,62,4,8,Bender,Narrator13125,Narrator,"  You're probably wondering why your ice cream went away. Well, Suzie, the culprit isn't foreigners, it's global warming!
",122,62,4,8,Narrator,Suzie13126,Suzie,"  Gwobal wappa?
",16,62,4,8,Narrator,Narrator13127,Narrator,"  Uh, yeah! Meet Mr. Sunbeam. He comes all the way from the sun to visit Earth.
",80,62,4,8,Suzie,Mr. Sunbeam13128,Mr. Sunbeam,"  Hello, Earth! Just poppin' in to brighten your day!  And now I'll be on my way!
",82,62,4,8,Narrator,Gas13129,Gas,"  Not so fast, Sunbeam! We're greenhouse gases. You ain't goin' nowhere!
",73,62,4,8,Mr. Sunbeam,Mr. Sunbeam13130,Mr. Sunbeam,"  Ooh! Ah! Oh, God, it hurts!
",30,62,4,8,Gas,Narrator13131,Narrator,"  Pretty soon, Earth is chock-full of sunbeams ...  ... their rotting corpses heating our atmosphere.
",102,62,4,8,Mr. Sunbeam,Suzie13132,Suzie,"  How do we get wid of the gweenhouse grasses?
",47,62,4,8,Narrator,Narrator13133,Narrator,"  Fortunately, our handsomest politicians came up with a cheap, last-minute way to combat global warming. Ever since 2063 we simply drop a giant ice cube into the ocean every now and then.
",189,62,4,8,Suzie,Suzie13134,Suzie,"  Just like Daddy puts in his drink every morning.  And then he gets mad.
",74,62,4,8,Narrator,Narrator13135,Narrator,"  Of course, since the greenhouse gases are still building up, it takes more and more ice each time.  Thus solving the problem once and for all.
",145,62,4,8,Suzie,Suzie13136,Suzie,"  But--
",8,62,4,8,Narrator,Narrator13137,Narrator,"  Once and for all!
",20,62,4,8,Suzie,Leela13138,Leela," Well, we just need one of those big ice cubes. Someone should call the losers who are supposed to deliver it.  Hello?
",119,62,4,8,Narrator,Nixon13139,Nixon,"  President Nixon here.  I'm hiring you losers to deliver the ice. And hurry up! I'm sweating like J. Edgar Hoover trying to squeeze into a new girdle!
",152,62,4,8,Leela,Farnsworth13140,Farnsworth," You heard the good news, everyone! Save the Earth, et cetera, et cetera!  Bye!
",80,62,4,8,Nixon,Fry13141,Fry," Wait! Where do we get the ice?
",32,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13142,Farnsworth," The wha? Oh, Halley's Comet, of course. The only sufficient source of ice cubes that don't have bugs in them.
",111,62,4,8,Fry,Fry13143,Fry," Wow! Mining a comet! That sounds fun.
",39,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13144,Farnsworth," Yes, there's no safer occupation than mining. Especially when you're perched on a snowball whipping through space at a million miles an hour.  Safe!
",150,62,4,8,Fry,Bender13145,Bender,"  Deploying ice drill.
",23,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Fry13146,Fry," Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the ice crushes you!  Yakov Smirnov said it.
",80,62,4,8,Bender,Leela13147,Leela," No, he didn't.
",16,62,4,8,Fry,Bender13148,Bender,"  Activating ice drill.
",24,62,4,8,Leela,Fry13149,Fry," Oh, my God! It's out of ice! Like some outer space Motel 6!
",61,62,4,8,Bender,Leela13150,Leela," Completely out of ice?
",24,62,4,8,Fry,Bender13151,Bender," This could mean the end of the banana daiquiri as we know it ... also life.
",77,62,4,8,Leela,Linda13152,Linda,"  With Halley's Comet out of ice, Earth is experiencing the devastating effects of sudden intense global warming.
",114,62,4,8,Bender,Morbo13153,Morbo,"  Morbo is pleased but sticky. The scorching heat has melted the polar ice caps, causing floods of biblical proportion.
",120,62,4,8,Linda,Randy13154,Randy,"  They called me crazy for building this ark.
",46,62,4,8,Morbo,Soupy13155,Soupy,"  You are crazy. You filled it with same-sex animal couples!
",61,62,4,8,Randy,Randy13156,Randy,"  Hey! There are parts of the Bible I like and parts I don't like.
",67,62,4,8,Soupy,Morbo13157,Morbo,"  Direct your attention now to the African turtles seen here migrating to cooler homes in Holland.
",99,62,4,8,Randy,Bender13158,Bender,"  That poor turtle!
",20,62,4,8,Morbo,Fry13159,Fry," Bender? Are you crying?
",25,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13160,Bender,"  Uh, no! Never!
",17,62,4,8,Fry,Morbo13161,Morbo,"  Morbo wishes these stalwart nomads peace among the Dutch tulips.
",67,62,4,8,Bender,Linda13162,Linda,"  I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.
",48,62,4,8,Morbo,Morbo13163,Morbo,"  Windmills do not work that way!  Goodnight!
",46,62,4,8,Linda,Bender13164,Bender," Well, everybody, I just saved a turtle. What have you done with your lives?
",77,62,4,8,Morbo,Hermes13165,Hermes," You went all the way to Holland already?
",42,62,4,8,Bender,Leela13166,Leela," Bender, a turtle isn't yourself. Why do you care about it?
",60,62,4,8,Hermes,Bender13167,Bender," Because I also care deeply about things that remind me of myself. Like poor little Shelly here.
",97,62,4,8,Leela,Hermes13168,Hermes," What could you possibly have in common with this walking soup mix?
",68,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13169,Bender," For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell.  But lead a rich, inner life. And also ... well, you know.
",109,62,4,8,Hermes,Leela13170,Leela," You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gamblers?
",65,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13171,Bender," No! It's just ... neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back.
",77,62,4,8,Leela,Fry13172,Fry," What? I've seen you get up off your back tons of times.
",57,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13173,Bender," Those times I was slightly on my side.
",40,62,4,8,Fry,Hermes13174,Hermes," Interesting. Maybe we should test this erectile dysfunction of yours, Bender.
",79,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13175,Bender," Uh, no! That's not necessary, really! I think I hear my factory recalling me.  Oh! That's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you.
",141,62,4,8,Hermes,Van13176,Van," Calling all scientists, calling all scientists. Be advised there will be a worldwide conference on global warming in Kyoto, Japan.
",132,62,4,8,Bender,Man #113177,Man #1," I've got a degree in homeopathic medicine!
",44,62,4,8,Van,Van13178,Van," You've got a degree in baloney!
",33,62,4,8,Man #1,Amy13179,Amy," Professor Farnsworth, you're a scientist!
",43,62,4,8,Van,Farnsworth13180,Farnsworth," Forget it, I'm not going! I have my reasons! Shut up, all of you!
",67,62,4,8,Amy,Hermes13181,Hermes," Strange. You haven't acted this suspicious since I found those ""ape bones"" in the basement.
",93,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13182,Farnsworth," My hip hurts! I'm in the middle of cooking a turkey! I have warranty cards to fill out! I am not just making excuses! Alright, I'll go!
",137,62,4,8,Hermes,Woman #1 #113183,Woman #1 #1,"  Oh, God, I can't believe it!
",31,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Woman #1 #213184,Woman #1 #2,"  I love you!
",14,62,4,8,Woman #1 #1,Rivers13185,Rivers," Oh, oh, oh! It's Professor Hubert Farnsworth! He's looking sharp in a standard white lab coat and dark slacks! His wristwatch is a Casio.
",139,62,4,8,Woman #1 #2,Van13186,Van," Thank you all for coming. It is my pleasure to introduce the host of the Kyoto Global Warming Convention. The inventor of the environment and first Emperor of the Moon: Al Gore.
",179,62,4,8,Rivers,Al Gore13187,Al Gore," I have ridden the mighty Moon Worm.
",37,62,4,8,Van,Fry13188,Fry," Good for him!
",15,62,4,8,Al Gore,Gore13189,Gore," My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss in my book Earth in the Balance and the much more popular Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth, we need to defend our planet against pollution. As well as dark wizards.
",206,62,4,8,Fry,Dark Wizard13190,Dark Wizard," Sure! Blame the wizards!
",26,62,4,8,Gore,Gore13191,Gore," That's why I'm offering a bag of Moon Sapphires to the first scientist who can solve this problem once and for all.  Lovely, aren't they?
",139,62,4,8,Dark Wizard,Dark Wizard13192,Dark Wizard," Sapphires?  With those I could open the Gate of Kerash!
",57,62,4,8,Gore,Gore13193,Gore," First up is Professor Ogden Wernstrom.
",40,62,4,8,Dark Wizard,Farnsworth13194,Farnsworth," Wernstrom!
",12,62,4,8,Gore,Wernstrom13195,Wernstrom," Ladies and gentlemen, I have placed in orbit a giant mirror that will reflect 40% of the sun's rays, thus cooling Earth. Observe.
",131,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Wernstrom13196,Wernstrom," Problem solved.
",17,62,4,8,Wernstrom,Man #113197,Man #1," Ooh! That's a little bright.
",30,62,4,8,Wernstrom,Gore13198,Gore," Alright, what else we got?
",28,62,4,8,Man #1,Fry13199,Fry," Professor, you're a professor. You must have some ideas.
",58,62,4,8,Gore,Farnsworth13200,Farnsworth," Absolutely not! I won't speak! I've got nothing to hide!
",58,62,4,8,Fry,Gore13201,Gore," Our next speaker is Professor--
",33,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13202,Farnsworth," I demand the floor!
",21,62,4,8,Gore,Gore13203,Gore," Yes, it's your turn to speak.
",31,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13204,Farnsworth," Well nuts to me. I'm taking the stage!  I know the source of the greenhouse gases. But in my shame I've kept it secret for 75 long years. Oh, it haunts my memory still.
",170,62,4,8,Gore,Fry13205,Fry," Professor, no! Don't do it!
",29,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13206,Farnsworth," Don't do what? Don't use this memory ray so I can remember what happened back then?
",85,62,4,8,Fry,Farnsworth13207,Farnsworth,"  It was October 17th at 1:54pm and 14 birds were flying by the window. I was working at Mom's Friendly Robot Company. Back then, you see, robots were slow-moving, stiff and a little on the uptight side.
",204,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Prototype13208,Prototype," Oh, dear. Might I favour master with a tender kiss on the forehead?
",69,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13209,Farnsworth," Oh, I've failed again.
",24,62,4,8,Prototype,Prototype13210,Prototype," Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
",31,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13211,Farnsworth,"  The owner of the company pressured me to create a bigger sportier robot.
",75,62,4,8,Prototype,Farnsworth13212,Farnsworth," Stop!
",7,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13213,Farnsworth,"  It wasn't easy but, by sacrificing fuel efficiency, I succeeded.
",67,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Mom13214,Mom," What was that?
",16,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13215,Farnsworth," A flaming burp.
",17,62,4,8,Mom,Mom13216,Mom," Does it always do that?
",25,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13217,Farnsworth," It's not always a burp. We still have one problem though: This robot will never meet emission standards.
",106,62,4,8,Mom,Mom13218,Mom," Crap spackle!  We'll just call it a sport utility robot and classify it as a light truck.
",91,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13219,Farnsworth," Well, I suppose the environment can take one more for the team.
",65,62,4,8,Mom,Farnsworth13220,Farnsworth,"  What a fool I was. If only I had made the effort to develop a cleaner-burning robot. But I was tired and in love.
",116,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Mom13221,Mom," Take me now, you stud!
",24,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13222,Farnsworth," Oh, this is all my fault!
",27,62,4,8,Mom,Fry13223,Fry," That's awful, Professor. Especially the making-out part.
",58,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Gore13224,Gore," Yeah, I didn't need to hear that.
",35,62,4,8,Fry,Farnsworth13225,Farnsworth," All modern robots descend from my original smog-blasting designs. And that's the cause of global warming today.
",113,62,4,8,Gore,Wernstrom13226,Wernstrom," Huh, so the robots are to blame. As I suspected.  We are left with only one possible course of action, grim though it be.
",123,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Bender13227,Bender," I got a good feeling about this!
",34,62,4,8,Wernstrom,Wernstrom13228,Wernstrom," We must immediately and permanently shut down, dismantle and destroy all robots!
",82,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13229,Bender," No!
",5,62,4,8,Wernstrom,Farnsworth13230,Farnsworth," Wait, surely there's a better--
",33,62,4,8,Bender,Van13231,Van," The conference is over.
",25,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Gore13232,Gore," I must go now, to help collect cans on Jupiter. Peace out, y'all!
",67,62,4,8,Van,Crowd13233,Crowd,"  Destroy all robots! Destroy all robots!
",42,62,4,8,Gore,Amy13234,Amy," Poor Bender.
",14,62,4,8,Crowd,Fry13235,Fry," Be brave, my friend.
",22,62,4,8,Amy,Leela13236,Leela," Come on. You've got to come out of your chest sometime.  Would you do it for a Bender snack?
",94,62,4,8,Fry,Fry13237,Fry," Aha!
",6,62,4,8,Leela,Leela13238,Leela," Gotcha!
",9,62,4,8,Fry,Bender13239,Bender," Let me go! I don't even want the stupid beer!  Yes! You tried to trick me into coming out of my chest. But who has the beer now?  I've got mail!
",146,62,4,8,Leela,Amy13240,Amy," Ooh! It's a party, apparently.
",32,62,4,8,Bender,Nixon13241,Nixon,"  Do you like to party? To boogie down? Well I'm throwing an all-night beach raver for my robot pals. It all goes down Saturday on the isolated Galapagos Islands where there will be no escape ... from the fun! All robots must attend.
",234,62,4,8,Amy,Zoidberg13242,Zoidberg," Strange: Why would Nixon, an awkward, uncomfortable man, suddenly throw a party, one of the most social events imaginable?  It's a trap, is why! They're going to deactivate all the robots!  I don't hear any gasping.
",217,62,4,8,Nixon,Leela13243,Leela," We all figured that out.
",26,62,4,8,Zoidberg,Bender13244,Bender," Well, I'm off.
",16,62,4,8,Leela,Fry13245,Fry," Wait! We could hide you. We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a bowl.
",75,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13246,Bender," No. I'm going to the party.
",29,62,4,8,Fry,Fry13247,Fry," I won't let you!
",18,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13248,Bender," Fry, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, vengeance, Father O'Mally's weed whacker. But, at long last, I've found something I'm willing to die for: This mindless turtle.
",205,62,4,8,Fry,Fry13249,Fry," Bender, this world isn't good enough for you.
",47,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13250,Bender," Not even close. Goodbye, everybody! Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead.   It's booby trapped!
",96,62,4,8,Fry,Robot #1 #113251,Robot #1 #1," Oh, yeah!

",16,62,4,8,Robot #1 #1,Bender13253,Bender," Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if I had a drink.  Crummy keg! It's completely ta-- Oh, you're a robot!
",107,62,4,8,Robot #1 #2,Keg Robot #113254,Keg Robot #1," Don't stop!
",13,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13255,Bender," Ew!
",5,62,4,8,Keg Robot #1,Nixon13256,Nixon," Attention, happening robots: Who's got what it takes to party with Nixon?  You fellas enjoy yourselves for the next two hours. And be sure not to leave the island, uh, for at least two hours. I'm going out to pick up some smokes ... uh, really good smokes. Two hours.  OK, headless body of Agnew, let's blow this joint!
",321,62,4,8,Bender,Crushinator13257,Crushinator,"  Do you want to dance?
",24,62,4,8,Nixon,Bender13258,Bender," Nah, I'm not really in the--
",30,62,4,8,Crushinator,Crushinator13259,Crushinator,"  You know you want to.
",24,62,4,8,Bender,Wernstrom13260,Wernstrom," Per your orders, I modified my mirror to fire a colossal electromagnetic pulse at the Galapagos. Every robot will be instantly and painfully terminated. Now for your part of the bargain.
",188,62,4,8,Crushinator,Nixon13261,Nixon," Aroo! Very well. Agnew, you belong to Wernstrom now.
",54,62,4,8,Wernstrom,Bender13262,Bender," I'll say goodbye now. There ain't not turtles where daddy's a-going.  Don't tell anybody, but Nixon's about to shut all robots off and--
",138,62,4,8,Nixon,Boom Mic-bot13263,Boom Mic-bot,"  What?
",8,62,4,8,Bender,Robot #1 #313264,Robot #1 #3,"  We're gonna die!
",19,62,4,8,Boom Mic-bot,Preacherbot13265,Preacherbot,"  We're going to the great beyond!
",35,62,4,8,Robot #1 #3,Chain Smoker13266,Chain Smoker,"  Nixon's not bringing the smokes!
",35,62,4,8,Preacherbot,Bender13267,Bender," Shut up and pay attention to me, Bender!  Look, I love life and its pleasures as much as anyone here. Except perhaps you, Hedonismbot.  But we need to be shut off! Especially you, Hedonismbot!
",194,62,4,8,Chain Smoker,Hedonismbot13268,Hedonismbot," I apologise for nothing!
",26,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13269,Bender," We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles.
",74,62,4,8,Hedonismbot,Preacherbot13270,Preacherbot," To hell with the turtles!
",27,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13271,Bender," No one insults the turtles!

",12,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13273,Bender," Come on!
",10,62,4,8,Preacherbot,Hedonismbot13274,Hedonismbot," Let the games begin!
",22,62,4,8,Bender,Farnsworth13275,Farnsworth," Everyone, listen!
",19,62,4,8,Hedonismbot,Preacherbot13276,Preacherbot," Aw, damn!
",11,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13277,Farnsworth," I've devised a way to save you and stop global warming at the same time. Granted, you're all blasting out greenhouse gases--
",126,62,4,8,Preacherbot,Bender13278,Bender,"  You're one to talk!
",22,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13279,Farnsworth," But we can use those very gases to save the planet. If you all vent your exhaust directly upward in one burst, it should thrust the Earth further from the sun, thus cooling it.  By my calculations, we'll need the full force of every last robot. So, quickly, everyone point your exhaust vents straight upwards.  Now vent! Vent like the wind!  Harder! Harder!
",359,62,4,8,Bender,Fry13280,Fry," Why isn't this working?!
",26,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Leela13281,Leela," Some lazy or polite robot is holding it in.
",45,62,4,8,Fry,Bender13282,Bender," Help! Help!
",13,62,4,8,Leela,Farnsworth13283,Farnsworth," A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished. Oh, the Jedis are going to feel this one!
",95,62,4,8,Bender,Bender13284,Bender," I'm sorry, buddy. At least we'll die on our backs, helpless.  Huh? What the hell are you doing?  Hey, you trying to make me look bad?  Aha! I'm even greater than I thought I was! And now to fulfill my destiny.
",211,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Nixon13285,Nixon," Fire!  What the--?
",20,62,4,8,Bender,Wernstrom13286,Wernstrom," We missed!
",12,62,4,8,Nixon,Nixon13287,Nixon," Professor, for saving the Earth and foiling me, I proudly, yet angrily, present you with Earth's new highest honour: The Polluting Medal of Pollution.
",152,62,4,8,Wernstrom,Farnsworth13288,Farnsworth," Thank you. I deserve this!
",28,62,4,8,Nixon,Bender13289,Bender," Hey, Professor, now that the Earth's orbit is further from the sun, won't that make the year longer?
",102,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13290,Farnsworth," Why, yes! One week longer to be exact.
",40,62,4,8,Bender,Nixon13291,Nixon," In that case I hereby declare it Robot Party Week!
",52,62,4,8,Farnsworth,Bender13292,Bender," Alright, baby!
",16,62,4,8,Nixon,Farnsworth13293,Farnsworth," Pazuzu, you ungrateful gargoyle! I put you through college, and this is how you repay me?
",91,63,4,9,Bender,Farnsworth13294,Farnsworth," Let's get this gargoyle hunt on the road. Driving gloves, driving goggles, driving thong. There!
",98,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Leela13295,Leela," Uh, maybe I should drive.
",27,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13296,Farnsworth," You? A woman? I'm trying to catch a monster, not find the quickest route to the mall! Let me just adjust the seat.
",116,63,4,9,Leela,Fry13297,Fry," My God! He's gonna do it! Everybody, seatbelts to maximum buckling.
",69,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13298,Farnsworth,"  Pazuzu? Oh, Pazuzu?
",22,63,4,9,Fry,Randy13299,Randy,"  Hey, grandpa, move your wrinkly old kiester!
",47,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13300,Farnsworth,"  Shut up!
",11,63,4,9,Randy,Leela13301,Leela," For Heaven's Gate, Professor. This ship can do 99% light speed. Why are we going 35 miles an hour?
",100,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13302,Farnsworth," Because we're in a hurry, that's why.
",39,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13303,Leela," Plus, you have the high beams on!
",35,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13304,Farnsworth,"  I can't quite read the sign.  Pazuzu? Pazuzu?
",48,63,4,9,Leela,Bender13305,Bender," Yo, Captain Cataract? What are we doing here?
",47,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13306,Farnsworth," Oh, it's 2.30. We can still catch the early bird dinner special.
",66,63,4,9,Bender,Fry13307,Fry," Uh, aren't we looking for your gargoyle?
",42,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13308,Farnsworth," My wha?
",9,63,4,9,Fry,Farnsworth13309,Farnsworth," Hello, Mavis! Surprised to see me back again so soon?
",55,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Wanda13310,Wanda," Mavis is dead.
",16,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13311,Farnsworth," I expect you'll want to see my angry, crotchety, grandpa discount card.
",73,63,4,9,Wanda,Wanda13312,Wanda," Sir, this card has expired.
",29,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13313,Farnsworth," But it's good for a lifetime.
",31,63,4,9,Wanda,Wanda13314,Wanda," Well, yours expired.
",22,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Leela13315,Leela," Oh, Lord! Teeth do not belong in your pants, Professor.
",57,63,4,9,Wanda,Farnsworth13316,Farnsworth," Well, I can't keep them in my mouth. They're nuclear-powered!
",63,63,4,9,Leela,Fry13317,Fry," Ow! It bit my finger!
",23,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Leela13318,Leela," No! No! It's tasted human blood!
",34,63,4,9,Fry,Farnsworth13319,Farnsworth," Mmm! Damn good meat!
",22,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13320,Leela," Professor, we've talked it over and everybody thinks you're too old.
",70,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Amy13321,Amy," Right on.
",11,63,4,9,Leela,Fry13322,Fry," Yup.
",6,63,4,9,Amy,Bender13323,Bender," Uh-huh!
",9,63,4,9,Fry,Hermes13324,Hermes," We've decided to do the merciful thing and have you euthasised.
",65,63,4,9,Bender,Farnsworth13325,Farnsworth," Dear God, no!
",15,63,4,9,Hermes,Amy13326,Amy," Oh, relax, Professor. ""Youthasizing"" is a trendy, new spa treatment. It's this season's shark-cartilage enema.
",112,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13327,Farnsworth," But I like being old. I don't have to talk to my parents, no one asks me to help move their stuff, I don't need to understand today's ""edgy"" TV sitcoms.
",154,63,4,9,Amy,Leela13328,Leela," OK, OK. We're not gonna force you until I finish this sentence. Get him!
",74,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13329,Farnsworth,"  My thong!
",12,63,4,9,Leela,Heather13330,Heather," Hi! I'm Heather, your personal Youthasizer. Let's get started with a nice botulism treatment, shall we?
",105,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13331,Farnsworth," Go to hell, Heather!
",22,63,4,9,Heather,Heather13332,Heather," Oh!  In small doses, botchelism toxin tightens and tones the facial muscles instead of killing you in the most horrible fashion imaginable.
",141,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13333,Farnsworth," Give me back my floppy face!
",30,63,4,9,Heather,Farnsworth13334,Farnsworth," Careful with the giblets!
",27,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Heather13335,Heather," Hmm. You're still retaining a lot of grump in these joints.  More pressure.
",77,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Heather13336,Heather," Since this is such a serious case of old, we'll have to try our strongest treatment: A soothing full-body bath in searing-hot tar.  Sir, it's not necessary or wise to be naked.
",178,63,4,9,Heather,Farnsworth13337,Farnsworth," You sound just like my tennis instructor.
",43,63,4,9,Heather,Heather13338,Heather," The tar blisters the age right out of the body in what top scientists suspect is a miracle.
",93,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13339,Farnsworth," Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
",159,63,4,9,Heather,Fry13340,Fry," He still sounds sorta old. Sorta real old.
",44,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Bender13341,Bender," Step aside, lady.  Like everything else in life, pumping is just a primitive, degenerate form of bending.   C'mon, Bender, pump harder! Harder!  I'm trying as hard as I can.  Harder, damn you!
",194,63,4,9,Fry,Farnsworth13342,Farnsworth," Well, that was an utter waste of time.
",40,63,4,9,Bender,Amy13343,Amy," Professor, it worked! You look young enough to be my father!
",62,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13344,Farnsworth," Poodle spit!  53 years old?  Now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn.
",74,63,4,9,Amy,Fry13345,Fry,"  This is great, Professor! We should go out and celebrate!
",60,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13346,Farnsworth," Dear Lord! You've all reverted to your childhood forms.
",57,63,4,9,Fry,Zoidberg13347,Zoidberg," Hooray! I'm a teenage heartthrob again!
",41,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13348,Farnsworth," While I try to restore our normal ages, I expect you all to go about your jobs like responsible professionals.
",112,63,4,9,Zoidberg,Hermes13349,Hermes," It wasn't me, Mr. F. It was Amy!  Stop it, Amy!
",49,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Amy13350,Amy," You stink!
",12,63,4,9,Hermes,Hermes13351,Hermes," You know you did it!
",22,63,4,9,Amy,Farnsworth13352,Farnsworth," Quiet! Quiet, I say!
",22,63,4,9,Hermes,Labarbara13353,Labarbara," We're here to take my little stub of a husband home. Hermes, say goodbye to Mr. Farnsworth.
",93,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Hermes13354,Hermes," Goodbye, Mr. Dumbsworth!
",26,63,4,9,Labarbara,Leela13355,Leela," Hey! This my chance to spend time with my parents too.
",56,63,4,9,Hermes,Fry13356,Fry," But your parents are gross sewer mutants.
",43,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13357,Leela," When I was an orphan, I always wished I could grow up with my mom and dad. And now, thanks to being hurled backwards in time--
",128,63,4,9,Fry,Farnsworth13358,Farnsworth," That's not what happened! Shut up and go live with your parents.
",66,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13359,Leela," It's gonna be totally awesome, Mom! You and me can bake and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face. And if some kid picks on me, my dad can beat up his dad.
",166,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Morris13360,Morris," Can't I just beat up the kid?
",31,63,4,9,Leela,Munda13361,Munda," Well, OK, Leela. If you think you can put up with your father, then welcome home. We'll try to respect your independence and freedom.
",135,63,4,9,Morris,Leela13362,Leela," No! I want the real teen experience: Chores, curfew, the works!
",65,63,4,9,Munda,Morris13363,Morris," Fine, Sweetiekins, we'll be the strictest parents ever. Now, let's all have some tequila to celebrate!
",104,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13364,Leela," Dad! I'm underage!
",20,63,4,9,Morris,Morris13365,Morris," Oh, right. Here's a silly straw.
",34,63,4,9,Leela,Mrs. Wong13366,Mrs. Wong," Oh, my Amy's sweet little girl again! This is like a mother's dream. Bad dream, that is! At this rate, I'm never going to get a grandchild!
",141,63,4,9,Morris,Leo13367,Leo," Maybe she not grown up but she sure grown out! She fat!
",57,63,4,9,Mrs. Wong,Amy13368,Amy," Dad, if you're gonna make fat jokes till I get cute again, I'm just gonna stay in my room.
",92,63,4,9,Leo,Leo13369,Leo," Stay in room? You so fat, you gonna stay all around room!
",59,63,4,9,Amy,Farnsworth13370,Farnsworth," I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours. And those jerks at social security stopped sending me checks. Now I have to pay them!
",220,63,4,9,Leo,Bender13371,Bender," I'm tired of your yapping.  All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things better. Well, I'm running away from this dead-end family! I know there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!
",220,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13372,Farnsworth," Fine! Get going!
",18,63,4,9,Bender,Bender13373,Bender," Oh, I'm going! You're gonna be all ""Where's Bender? I miss Bender"".
",69,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13374,Farnsworth," We won't know that until you leave.
",37,63,4,9,Bender,Bender13375,Bender," Oh, I'm leaving!
",18,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13376,Farnsworth," There's the door.
",19,63,4,9,Bender,Bender13377,Bender," I'll be good.
",15,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Munda13378,Munda," Ah, do you have to shed your skin on the couch? What do we live in, a zoo?
",76,63,4,9,Bender,Morris13379,Morris," I'm getting the doorbell.  For me?
",36,63,4,9,Munda,Fry13380,Fry,"  Oh, uh, hello, sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um, I'm here to pick up your daughter.
",101,63,4,9,Morris,Leela13381,Leela," Hi, Fry! I like your blazer.
",30,63,4,9,Fry,Fry13382,Fry," Thanks. These aren't pockets, they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock.
",78,63,4,9,Leela,Munda13383,Munda," So, where are you taking my daughter tonight?
",47,63,4,9,Fry,Fry13384,Fry,"  A movie.  A movie, ma'am.
",28,63,4,9,Munda,Morris13385,Morris," Well, whatever you're really doing, don't wake us if you get in after 12.
",75,63,4,9,Fry,Leela13386,Leela," Dad, you're being too lenient again! I have to be back by 11.
",63,63,4,9,Morris,Munda13387,Munda," OK, OK. You're the boss!
",26,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13388,Leela," No, I'm not!
",14,63,4,9,Munda,Fry13389,Fry," I'd like a sewer burger but without the rat faeces.
",53,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13390,Leela," What are you, on a diet?
",26,63,4,9,Fry,Moose13391,Moose," Uh, Leela, you look hot.
",26,63,4,9,Leela,Man #1dy13392,Man #1dy," Jeez, Moose! Just dump me right in front of her, why don't you.
",65,63,4,9,Moose,Leela13393,Leela," Moose, Mandy; this is my friend Fry, from the surface.
",56,63,4,9,Man #1dy,Man #1dy13394,Man #1dy," Oh, so this is the famous Fry. What is he, like, the biggest loser on the surface so he has to hang out in the sewer?
",119,63,4,9,Leela,Fry13395,Fry,"  They're onto me!
",19,63,4,9,Man #1dy,Leela13396,Leela," Hey, come on! Let's act like grown-ups here. Wanna race?
",58,63,4,9,Fry,Moose13397,Moose," Uh, yeah!
",11,63,4,9,Leela,Sal13398,Sal," Theres. The world's drinkings water is safes for another days.  Whoas!  Cripe!
",80,63,4,9,Moose,Leela13399,Leela," A tapeworm!
",13,63,4,9,Sal,Fry13400,Fry," We missed the turn. We'll never catch them.
",45,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13401,Leela," Yes, we will. This sewer goes right under Planet Express, and it's 9pm!
",73,63,4,9,Fry,Farnsworth13402,Farnsworth,"  The devil take this predictable colon!
",41,63,4,9,Leela,Fry13403,Fry," Yeah!
",7,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Leela13404,Leela," Alright!
",10,63,4,9,Fry,Fry13405,Fry," Leela, you can stop winning now. We won!
",42,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13406,Leela," I'm too short to reach the handbrake!
",39,63,4,9,Fry,Dwayne13407,Dwayne," That's detention!
",19,63,4,9,Leela,Fry13408,Fry," And then, and then, this giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps but we like totally dissed Moose!
",103,63,4,9,Dwayne,Farnsworth13409,Farnsworth," Yes, I'd like to meet this Moose. But, in the meantime, I have good news. I may have solved our age problem.
",110,63,4,9,Fry,Fry13410,Fry," Yay!
",6,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13411,Farnsworth," It seems the Youthasizing tar was saturated with time-altering Chronitons. A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA as well as Bender's robo, or ""RNA"".
",151,63,4,9,Fry,Bender13412,Bender," Question.
",11,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13413,Farnsworth," Yes?
",6,63,4,9,Bender,Bender13414,Bender," You stink!
",12,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13415,Farnsworth," Yes, yes. Anyhow, I've designed an oil-eating bacterium that should take the tar right off.
",93,63,4,9,Bender,Fry13416,Fry,"  C'mon! Let's go tell Leela so we can grow up together!
",57,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Leela13417,Leela," Thanks, Professor. But I don't want the treatment.
",52,63,4,9,Fry,Farnsworth13418,Farnsworth," Don't you understand, you little nitwit? Unless you're treated soon, the only way to restore your true age would be to grow into it! Just as God intended.
",156,63,4,9,Leela,Munda13419,Munda," He has a point, honey. What about your job and your friends? Do you really want to abandon your old life?
",107,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Leela13420,Leela," My old life wasn't as glamorous as my webpage made it look. All I ever wanted was to grow up here, with you. Please?
",118,63,4,9,Munda,Munda13421,Munda," Well if it's what you really want.
",36,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13422,Leela," It is. I know it is.
",22,63,4,9,Munda,Fry13423,Fry," I'll miss you, Leela. I'll come back and visit when I'm all grown up.
",71,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13424,Leela,"  Bring beer.
",14,63,4,9,Fry,Morris13425,Morris," No beer till you finish your tequila!
",39,63,4,9,Leela,Farnsworth13426,Farnsworth,"  The age-restoring microbes are ready. Everyone into the bacterial spew chamber.
",82,63,4,9,Morris,Amy13427,Amy," Let's go!
",11,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Bender13428,Bender,"  Yes, everyone do the same thing!
",35,63,4,9,Amy,Farnsworth13429,Farnsworth," Initiating controlled infection.
",34,63,4,9,Bender,Zoidberg13430,Zoidberg," I'm no doctor, but this machine guy could use a lozenge.
",58,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Amy13431,Amy," Aw, pooh! We're even younger!
",31,63,4,9,Zoidberg,Farnsworth13432,Farnsworth," Day-umn! The bacteria pigged-out on the tar and now they're getting freaky-deaky, spreading Chronitons throughout our systems. We're getting younger by the minute!
",165,63,4,9,Amy,Amy13433,Amy," Yikes!
",8,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Zoidberg13434,Zoidberg," What? I'm going to revert through all my larval stages?
",57,63,4,9,Amy,Farnsworth13435,Farnsworth," Word! We'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than death: Pre-life ... then death.
",116,63,4,9,Zoidberg,Farnsworth13436,Farnsworth," I've got to stop this reverse-aging before we all shrivel up and suffer the agony of un-birth. Think, you disco duck, think!
",126,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Amy13437,Amy," What's that squirmal under your shirt?
",40,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13438,Farnsworth," Get off me, you parasitic lamprey!
",36,63,4,9,Amy,Zoidberg13439,Zoidberg," Oh, sure, like you need all your blood.
",41,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13440,Farnsworth," Would you all chill! I can't think with you kids cramping my style! Oh, I need a babysitter.
",94,63,4,9,Zoidberg,Leela13441,Leela," OK, quiet time. I know, everyone pretend a goblin ate your tongue and I'll read you a story.
",94,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Zoidberg13442,Zoidberg," I can't see from down here, I can't.
",38,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13443,Leela," There. Today's story is from New Teen magazine. What would you rather hear about? Four-legged Chachi or tentacled Chachi?
",123,63,4,9,Zoidberg,Fry13444,Fry," I wanna hear a space story!
",29,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13445,Leela," It's kind of a baby book. But OK. Let's see. Snow White Dwarf And The Seven Red Dwarves, Charlotte's Tholian Web, The Fountain Of Aging.
",138,63,4,9,Fry,Farnsworth13446,Farnsworth," The Fountain of Aging? Hmm. It is just a legend. Still, they called the Tooth Fairy a legend and now he's head of the FBI.
",124,63,4,9,Leela,Farnsworth13447,Farnsworth," Sup? Kids ready?
",18,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Fry13448,Fry," Professy's back!  Ew! You smell like smoking!  And drinking.
",62,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13449,Farnsworth," I had a few beers but I'm cool to drive.
",42,63,4,9,Fry,Leela13450,Leela," I wish I could come with you to say goodbye, before you all turn back in to grown-ups but I'm grounded for knocking the school over.
",134,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Munda13451,Munda," Who cares, Leela? It was just a public school. Now go with your friends, please.
",82,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13452,Leela," No! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room!
",55,63,4,9,Munda,Leela13453,Leela," Until she sneaks out!
",23,63,4,9,Leela,Bender13454,Bender," When I grow up, I wanna be a steam shovel!
",44,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13455,Leela," According to this, the Fountain is located in the darkest, most ancient region of space, just past Teddy Bear Junction.
",121,63,4,9,Bender,Farnsworth13456,Farnsworth," Teddy Bear Junction: The worst scum-hole in the galaxy.
",57,63,4,9,Leela,Farnsworth13457,Farnsworth," This solar system is, like, way old.
",38,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Leela13458,Leela," Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet.
",62,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13459,Farnsworth," Newsflash! Everything's getting older the closer we get to that ancient, burnt-out sun.
",89,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13460,Leela," Dude, the Fountain of Aging must be on the sun itself.
",56,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13461,Farnsworth," Shut up! I was gonna say that!
",32,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13462,Leela," We've got to hurry. The kids have only one change of pants!
",61,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13463,Farnsworth," We gotta be real, real careful to stay in just long enough to make us our right ages again.   Zoidberg! Get out of there!
",123,63,4,9,Leela,Zoidberg13464,Zoidberg,"  The current! It's too much, already! Help!
",45,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13465,Farnsworth," Jeepers!
",10,63,4,9,Zoidberg,Leela13466,Leela," Zoidberg is dead!
",19,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Zoidberg13467,Zoidberg," No! Zoidberg's brother is dead!  Funny story: I just reverted to the age where my siblings budded from me and my brother Norman split off and jumped in the fountain.
",167,63,4,9,Leela,Sibling #113468,Sibling #1," He always had to be the centre of attention!
",46,63,4,9,Zoidberg,Sibling #213469,Sibling #2," Let him go!
",13,63,4,9,Sibling #1,Leela13470,Leela," Oh, no!  Quick! Get them into the fountain!
",45,63,4,9,Sibling #2,Farnsworth13471,Farnsworth," Thanks for the help, Weewa. Once we're gwown up, you can go back to your famiwy. We'wl never bother you again.
",112,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13472,Leela," Well, you could bother me a little.
",37,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13473,Farnsworth," It's working! Hooray!  I can't hold on!
",41,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13474,Leela," I'm coming in after you!
",26,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13475,Farnsworth,"  No, Leela! You can't give up your childhood! You'll never have another chance at it!
",87,63,4,9,Leela,Fry13476,Fry," We did it! We're the right ages again!
",40,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Leela13477,Leela," I think I might be a couple years younger.
",44,63,4,9,Fry,Amy13478,Amy," Oh, me too!
",13,63,4,9,Leela,Farnsworth13479,Farnsworth,"  Help! I'm still in mid-peril, you clods!
",43,63,4,9,Amy,Leela13480,Leela," He's too far out! We can't reach him!
",39,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13481,Farnsworth,"  With my last breath I curse Zoidberg!  Pazuzu! Oh, you came back to me!
",74,63,4,9,Leela,Hermes13482,Hermes," Are you back to your original age, Professor?
",47,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13483,Farnsworth," Even older! Huzzah!
",21,63,4,9,Hermes,Fry13484,Fry," I'm sorry you had to give up being a kid, Leela.
",50,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Leela13485,Leela," Well, I guess every adult wants to be a kid again sometimes. But I worked hard to be the person I am.
",103,63,4,9,Fry,Fry13486,Fry," The fabulous person!
",22,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13487,Leela," With friends like you guys--
",30,63,4,9,Fry,Fry13488,Fry," Fabulous friends!
",19,63,4,9,Leela,Leela13489,Leela," And I'm really happy I have that life back.
",45,63,4,9,Fry,Farnsworth13490,Farnsworth," And you, my faithful fiend! How can I ever repay you?
",55,63,4,9,Leela,Pazuzu13491,Pazuzu,"  And zat, little one, is how Papa gained his freedom. Now, bonne nuit, bonne nuit to you all!
",95,63,4,9,Farnsworth,Fry13492,Fry," Delivery boy Philip J. Fry, reporting for duty.
",49,64,4,10,Pazuzu,Zoidberg13493,Zoidberg," Dr. Zoidberg, soaking in brine.
",33,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13494,Fry," What is the meaning of this? We've got a delivery, people. Let's move! Let's move!  Amy? Mission profile?  Interesting, interesting. Dr. Zoidberg, mission bag?
",161,64,4,10,Zoidberg,Zoidberg13495,Zoidberg," Packed and ready, sir.
",24,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13496,Fry," What's this? This is the same toy surprise I got last time!  I can't work under these conditions. And without me there is no mission. I am the mission!
",153,64,4,10,Zoidberg,Leela13497,Leela,"  We're back from the mission!
",31,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13498,Fry," Wh-What? You went without me?
",31,64,4,10,Leela,Bender13499,Bender,"  You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time.
",95,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13500,Fry," But-- But I'm the delivery boy.
",33,64,4,10,Bender,Leela13501,Leela," Don't worry. Everything went fine.
",36,64,4,10,Fry,Bender13502,Bender," Better than usual!
",20,64,4,10,Leela,Leela13503,Leela," We got medals! Good work, team! We really pulled together on this one.
",72,64,4,10,Bender,Zoidberg13504,Zoidberg,"  They got medals.
",19,64,4,10,Leela,Fry13505,Fry," I'm real sorry I missed the mission. I wasn't there and you might have needed me.
",83,64,4,10,Zoidberg,Bender13506,Bender," Nope.
",7,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13507,Fry," But if I'd been there I--
",27,64,4,10,Bender,Bender13508,Bender," Nope.
",7,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13509,Fry," Look--
",8,64,4,10,Bender,Bender13510,Bender," Nope.
",7,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13511,Fry," Bender's great--
",18,64,4,10,Bender,Bender13512,Bender," Nope!
",7,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13513,Fry," Listen, Leela, let me make it up by taking you out to dinner tonight.
",71,64,4,10,Bender,Leela13514,Leela," Nope.  I've got a date with Chaz.
",35,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13515,Fry," Chaz?
",7,64,4,10,Leela,Leela13516,Leela," I met him at that charity cock fight last week. He's the mayor's aide.
",72,64,4,10,Fry,Bender13517,Bender," Ooh! You go, mutant girl!
",27,64,4,10,Leela,Leela13518,Leela," I do go! He's a very important man.
",37,64,4,10,Bender,Fry13519,Fry," So? I'm just as important as him.  It's just that, the kind of importance I have ... it doesn't matter if I  don't do it.
",123,64,4,10,Leela,Fry13520,Fry," I'm nobody. There are guys in the background of Mary Worth comics who are more important than me.
",99,64,4,10,Fry,Bender13521,Bender," Ah, buck up, meatloaf. Bender'll take you out tonight and cheer you up. What do you wanna do? And I mean anything. You have the power! Name it and I'm there. You the man!
",172,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13522,Fry," Um, OK. Let's go bowling.
",27,64,4,10,Bender,Bender13523,Bender," Nah.
",6,64,4,10,Fry,Elzar13524,Elzar," Table for two? Step right this way.
",37,64,4,10,Bender,Chaz13525,Chaz," I'm afraid we don't have a reservation but, uh, as you can see ...  ... I'm the mayor's aide. Table for two, please.
",118,64,4,10,Elzar,Elzar13526,Elzar," OK then.
",10,64,4,10,Chaz,Elzar13527,Elzar," Bam!
",6,64,4,10,Elzar,Chaz13528,Chaz," It's OK, my man. I got you covered on your next health inspection.
",68,64,4,10,Elzar,Elzar13529,Elzar," I really appreciate that, mister mayor's aide.  Here you go. Compliments of the house.
",88,64,4,10,Chaz,Leela13530,Leela," Wow! Free bread at a restaurant? Is there anything you can't do?
",66,64,4,10,Elzar,Chaz13531,Chaz," I can't fail the mayor. Not ever.
",35,64,4,10,Leela,Fry13532,Fry," Oh, jeez! Better not let Leela see me.
",40,64,4,10,Chaz,Leela13533,Leela," Hey, I hear Fry.  Boy, am I glad you're here.
",47,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13534,Fry," You are? So things aren't working out with whatshisname?
",58,64,4,10,Leela,Leela13535,Leela," Actually ... they are! Confidentially, I might not make it back to my apartment tonight! Could you walk Nibbler for me?
",121,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13536,Fry," Um ... uh...
",14,64,4,10,Leela,Leela13537,Leela," And bring a baggy in case he drops a steamer.  Have a great night!
",68,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13538,Fry," Oh, no! Please! No!  Perfect!
",31,64,4,10,Leela,Smitty13539,Smitty," Whoa! Smells like a 289 in progress.
",38,64,4,10,Fry,URL13540,URL," Failure to scoop. Aw, yeah!
",29,64,4,10,Smitty,Fry13541,Fry," Wait! I'm trying. It weighs as much as a thousand suns.
",57,64,4,10,URL,Chaz13542,Chaz,"  Don't worry, Fry. I'll pull some strings -- see if I can't get you tried as a juvenile.
",90,64,4,10,Fry,Leela13543,Leela," Oh, Chaz!
",11,64,4,10,Chaz,Fry13544,Fry," I'm as worthless as this trash can.
",37,64,4,10,Leela,Trash Can13545,Trash Can," You think I'm as worthless as you? Try catching garbage in your head and raising six kids, you dumb townie!
",109,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13546,Fry," Oh, Nibbler, at least I'm important to you. Even if it's only 'cause I clean up you poop.
",91,64,4,10,Trash Can,Nibbler13547,Nibbler," The poop eradication is but one aspect of your importance.
",60,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13548,Fry," D-D-Did you just talk?
",24,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13549,Nibbler," Indeed. And I have other amazing powers as well.
",50,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13550,Fry," Like what?
",12,64,4,10,Nibbler,Fry13551,Fry," Are you my mommy?
",19,64,4,10,Fry,Nibbler13552,Nibbler," Negative.
",11,64,4,10,Fry,Fiona13553,Fiona," Welcome, Lord Nibbler.
",24,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13554,Nibbler," Welcome acknowledged. I bring with me ... the Mighty One.
",59,64,4,10,Fiona,Fry13555,Fry," Eh?
",5,64,4,10,Nibbler,Ken13556,Ken," At last, our centuries upon centuries of waiting have achieved fruition.
",74,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13557,Fry," Aw! Aren't you a fuzzy wittle guy?
",36,64,4,10,Ken,Ken13558,Ken," Stop that! Uh, please. Your Mightiness--
",42,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13559,Fry," Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guinea pigs.
",83,64,4,10,Ken,Ken13560,Ken," Does he not know?
",19,64,4,10,Fry,Nibbler13561,Nibbler," He does not know.
",19,64,4,10,Ken,Fiona13562,Fiona," He knows not?
",15,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13563,Nibbler," Knows not does he.
",20,64,4,10,Fiona,Nibblonian13564,Nibblonian," Not he know--
",15,64,4,10,Nibbler,Ken13565,Ken," Enough! Fry, it is my duty to inform you that the fate of humanity, the fate of our race, indeed the fate of all that exists and ever will exist rests with you. You are the single most important person in the universe.
",220,64,4,10,Nibblonian,Fry13566,Fry," Oh, snap!
",11,64,4,10,Ken,Nibbler13567,Nibbler," On this auspicious occasion, let the horn of eternity cut a thunderous blast.
",79,64,4,10,Fry,Fiona13568,Fiona," The Feast of a Thousand Beasts is begun.
",42,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibblonian13569,Nibblonian," You gonna eat that?
",21,64,4,10,Fiona,Fry13570,Fry," Maybe later.
",14,64,4,10,Nibblonian,Ken13571,Ken," The time has come to discuss matters of the gravest importance.
",65,64,4,10,Fry,Nibbler13572,Nibbler," Fry, do you remember some months ago when the Earth was attacked by flying brains?
",84,64,4,10,Ken,Fry13573,Fry," Hmm. I remember the square-dancing stomachs. Although that might have been a Mylanta commercial. Wait! The brains! I do remember! But no one else does. They said I was crazy.
",176,64,4,10,Nibbler,Ken13574,Ken," On the contrary. You remember because you were the only one immune to the Brains' mental attack.
",98,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13575,Fry," Because I'm so smart?
",23,64,4,10,Ken,Ken13576,Ken," Oh, my. Anyway, your immunity is due to the fact that you lack the delta brainwave.  It's a genetic abnormality which resulted when you went back in time and performed certain actions which made you your own grandfather.
",222,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13577,Fry," I did do the nasty in the past-y!
",35,64,4,10,Ken,Nibbler13578,Nibbler," Verily. And that past nastification is what shields you from the brains. You are the last hope of the universe.
",113,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13579,Fry," So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
",65,64,4,10,Nibbler,Ken13580,Ken," Yes. Except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
",50,64,4,10,Fry,Nibbler13581,Nibbler," For a thousand years, the evil Brains have been constructing the Infosphere, a giant memory bank twice the size of three ordinary memory banks.
",145,64,4,10,Ken,Fry13582,Fry," What's so evil about that?
",28,64,4,10,Nibbler,Fiona13583,Fiona," They plan to collect all the information in the universe and store it in the sphere.
",86,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13584,Fry," So they're trying to learn things?
",36,64,4,10,Fiona,Fiona13585,Fiona," Right.
",8,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13586,Fry," Those bastards!
",17,64,4,10,Fiona,Nibbler13587,Nibbler," Being Brains, they feel compelled to know everything. And soon they will.
",75,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13588,Fry," I'm as mad as I've ever been.
",31,64,4,10,Nibbler,Ken13589,Ken," Once their task is complete, they will ensure that no new information arises in the only way possible: By destroying the universe.
",132,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13590,Fry," Now it's personal.
",20,64,4,10,Ken,Fiona13591,Fiona," Your mission is to infiltrate the Infosphere and plant this quantum-interface bomb, blasting them into an alternate universe from which there is no return.
",157,64,4,10,Fry,Nibbler13592,Nibbler," Then outrun the blast on this Scooty-Puff Jr.
",47,64,4,10,Fiona,Fry13593,Fry," OK, let's go through this once more--
",39,64,4,10,Nibbler,Fry13594,Fry," Brains!
",9,64,4,10,Fry,Ken13595,Ken,"  Fear not, Mighty One. Your missing brainwave makes you invisible to them, so long as you avoid intense thinking.
",115,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13596,Fry," Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention.
",41,64,4,10,Ken,Ken13597,Ken,"  That is most wise.
",21,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13598,Fry," Who?
",6,64,4,10,Ken,Ken13599,Ken,"  In a few seconds, the Brain will finish scanning the last bits of information in the universe.
",97,64,4,10,Fry,Infosphere13600,Infosphere,"  Beavers mate for life; 11 greater than 4; for quality carpets, visit Kaplan's carpet warehouse.
",98,64,4,10,Ken,Ken13601,Ken,"  Now the Infosphere will open its protective crust so as to scan itself, completing its thousand year task.
",109,64,4,10,Infosphere,Fiona13602,Fiona,"  This is your one chance to enter the sphere. Scoot! Scoot now!
",65,64,4,10,Ken,Fry13603,Fry," I'm at the input console. I'm a little nervous and I've got brain in my buttcrack.
",84,64,4,10,Fiona,Nibbler13604,Nibbler,"  Roger.
",9,64,4,10,Fry,Ken13605,Ken,"  Once you press the detonator, you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape.
",81,64,4,10,Nibbler,Fry13606,Fry," Hey, wait. This brain knows everything about everything, right?
",65,64,4,10,Ken,Ken13607,Ken,"  It will soon. That's why you're supposed to be setting off a bomb.
",69,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13608,Fry," Yeah, yeah. But I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions of all time.  Is it true that postage stamp glue is made of--
",151,64,4,10,Ken,Huge Brain13609,Huge Brain," Correct. Toad mucus.
",22,64,4,10,Fry,Ken13610,Ken,"  There's no time for this. Activate the bomb.
",47,64,4,10,Huge Brain,Fry13611,Fry," Wait, wait, wait.  What really killed the dinosaurs?
",54,64,4,10,Ken,Huge Brain13612,Huge Brain," Me!
",5,64,4,10,Fry,Computer Voice13613,Computer Voice," Unauthorized data access.
",27,64,4,10,Huge Brain,Fry13614,Fry," Uh-oh!
",8,64,4,10,Computer Voice,Big Brain13615,Big Brain," Detecting trace amounts of mental activity. Possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon viewer.
",89,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13616,Fry," Ew! Gross. Cut it out!
",24,64,4,10,Big Brain,Brain #113617,Brain #1," Odd. He is immune to our psionic attack.
",42,64,4,10,Fry,Brain #213618,Brain #2," Impossible! We're an ambitious young squad with everything to prove.
",70,64,4,10,Brain #1,Big Brain13619,Big Brain," It appears we are in the presence of the fabled one. But without his Scooty-Puff Jr., he cannot escape.  Huh?
",111,64,4,10,Brain #2,Brain #213620,Brain #2," A quantum-interface bomb? Are you insane in the membrane?
",59,64,4,10,Big Brain,Fry13621,Fry," You got it, poindexter!
",25,64,4,10,Brain #2,Brain #113622,Brain #1," Oh, not good!

",65,64,4,10,Brain #3,Fry13626,Fry," Well at least I did one important thing with my life: Leading good to victory over evil!

",153,64,4,10,Ken,Fry13630,Fry," The day I got frozen? What about it?
",38,64,4,10,Big Brain,Nibbler13631,Nibbler,"  No! Don't ask about that! It-It would be, uh ... boring!
",59,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13632,Fry," Ah, forget it then.
",21,64,4,10,Nibbler,Big Brain13633,Big Brain," Query!
",8,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13634,Fry," OK! Sheesh! What happened to me, Philip J. Fry, on the night of December 31st, 1999?
",86,64,4,10,Big Brain,Huge Brain13635,Huge Brain," Clarification request: Are you the Philip J. Fry from Earth or the Philip J. Fry from Hovering Squidworld 97A?
",112,64,4,10,Fry,Big Brain13636,Big Brain," Earth, you fat idiot! Hurry up!
",33,64,4,10,Huge Brain,Fry13637,Fry,"  Hello? Pizza delivery for ...  ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!

",74,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13639,Fry,"  What the--
",13,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13640,Fry," I-- I don't understand. You made me go in the freezer tube?

",18,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13644,Fry," No, you can't. Shut your adorable trap!
",41,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13645,Nibbler,"  We had no choice. You were the only one who could help us. What is one life weighed against the entire universe?
",115,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13646,Fry,"  But it was my life.
",22,64,4,10,Nibbler,Computer Voice13647,Computer Voice," Detonation in two, one. Will the owner of a white Pontiac Firebird-- Oh, never mind. Zero!

",42,64,4,10,Computer Voice,Brain #213649,Brain #2," We could sing American Pie.
",29,64,4,10,Big Brain,Fry13650,Fry," Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those stupid racoons had never brought me to the future.
",89,64,4,10,Brain #2,Huge Brain13651,Huge Brain," I have shocking data relevant to this conversation.
",53,64,4,10,Fry,Big Brain13652,Big Brain," We don't care, you dope! We're in another universe. You're not in charge anymore.
",83,64,4,10,Huge Brain,Huge Brain13653,Huge Brain," It is possible for the Philip Fry to resume his life on December 31st, 1999.
",78,64,4,10,Big Brain,Fry13654,Fry," Really? I can go back in time?
",32,64,4,10,Huge Brain,Huge Brain13655,Huge Brain," There is a nexus point between universes at the space-time where you entered the cryogenic tube. You and only you can return there.
",133,64,4,10,Fry,Big Brain13656,Big Brain," Interesting. You could stop the Nibblonian from pushing you into the cryogenic tube.
",86,64,4,10,Huge Brain,Fry13657,Fry," That is interesting. Why?
",27,64,4,10,Big Brain,Big Brain13658,Big Brain," It would be as if you never came to the future. You will have your life back and we will succeed in our plan to understand and destroy the universe.
",150,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13659,Fry," Everybody wins!
",17,64,4,10,Big Brain,Brain #213660,Brain #2," The human will be returned to the past!
",41,64,4,10,Fry,Narrator13661,Narrator,"  Meanwhile.
",13,64,4,10,Brain #2,Leela13662,Leela," I love rocket skating! But the wait is always so long. Poor Fry once stood in line for six hours just to get me a ticket.
",123,64,4,10,Narrator,Chaz13663,Chaz," Six hours? Pft! Sounds like a real nobody! But now it's time for somebody and some chick he's with to go skating.
",115,64,4,10,Leela,Leela13664,Leela," You reserved the whole rink?
",30,64,4,10,Chaz,Chaz13665,Chaz," Yup. Buzzed ahead, let 'em know whose aide was coming by. The mayor's, that's whose.
",86,64,4,10,Leela,Leela13666,Leela," Oh, Chaz!
",11,64,4,10,Chaz,Sally13667,Sally," Mr. Vogel, I thought we was going skating.
",44,64,4,10,Leela,Vogel13668,Vogel," No, we're not important enough. Everybody just hold hands until the bus driver comes back from his haircut.
",109,64,4,10,Sally,Leela13669,Leela," Aw, let's let those kids skate with us.
",41,64,4,10,Vogel,Chaz13670,Chaz," What? Seriously? I'm trying to impress you with my clout here.
",64,64,4,10,Leela,Leela13671,Leela," I know, and it's working. But think how much skating would mean to those kids.
",80,64,4,10,Chaz,Nina13672,Nina," We came here instead of eating today.
",39,64,4,10,Leela,Leela13673,Leela," This may be their only chance to skate in their whole lives. Who are we to say they can't?
",92,64,4,10,Nina,Chaz13674,Chaz," The mayor's aide, and his badge.  Beat it, kids! Come back when you got connections!
",86,64,4,10,Leela,Vogel13675,Vogel," Alright, little ones, back to the orphanarium. You can slide around the gym in your socks.
",92,64,4,10,Chaz,Sally13676,Sally," What socks?
",13,64,4,10,Vogel,Chaz13677,Chaz," So am I gonna get lucky tonight or what?
",42,64,4,10,Sally,Fry13678,Fry," I hope your calculations are correct.
",39,64,4,10,Chaz,Big Brain13679,Big Brain," Our calculations are always correct. For we are gigantic brains.

",31,64,4,10,Big Brain,Nibbler13681,Nibbler," I hereby place an order for one cheese pizza.

",37,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13683,Nibbler," I-period-C-period-Wiener.
",27,64,4,10,Panucci,Panucci13684,Panucci,"  Uh, talk a little louder. It sounds like you got some kind of tiny head on you or something.
",95,64,4,10,Nibbler,Fry13685,Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for, uh ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!
",57,64,4,10,Panucci,Fry13686,Fry," Gotcha!
",9,64,4,10,Fry,Nibbler13687,Nibbler," I don't understand.
",21,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13688,Fry," Yes, you do! You came back in time to knock me into that freezer and now I came back in time to stop you.
",107,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13689,Nibbler," I did not come back in time. My people lack that ability.
",59,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13690,Fry," But ... I know you in the future. I-I cleaned your poop.
",58,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13691,Nibbler," Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. You will meet me when I'm a thousand years older.
",108,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13692,Fry," Not if you don't freeze me.
",29,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13693,Nibbler," Please. Our saviours foresee that in a thousand years, for one moment, the fate of the universe will depend on you. Since you will not live that long I must freeze you now.
",174,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13694,Fry," Well, why couldn't you just ask me?
",37,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13695,Nibbler," We were afraid you would refuse.
",34,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13696,Fry," Of course not. I love the future.
",35,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13697,Nibbler," Then why are you choking me right now?
",40,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13698,Fry," Because I don't like being used.
",34,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13699,Nibbler," Well now it's your choice. Is there nothing in the future worth saving?
",73,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13700,Fry," Hm. Leela. But she doesn't think much of me.
",46,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13701,Nibbler," Ah, she must be The Other.
",28,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13702,Fry," What?
",7,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13703,Nibbler," You must not give up on her. I am stationed on a distant world known as Vergon 6. But, if you return to the future, I will transfer to Earth to give you what help I can.
",171,64,4,10,Fry,Crowd13704,Crowd,"  Ten, nine, eight, seven...
",29,64,4,10,Nibbler,Fry13705,Fry," You really think I would have had a chance with Leela?
",56,64,4,10,Crowd,Nibbler13706,Nibbler," You must choose: The present or the future? To save yourself or to save Leela.
",80,64,4,10,Fry,Crowd13707,Crowd,"  One.
",7,64,4,10,Nibbler,Fry13708,Fry," Yes! Here I come, future! Oh, no! Wait! I'm gonna get trapped in the Infosphere again! Just remember that Scooty-Puff Jr. sucks.
",130,64,4,10,Crowd,Nibbler13709,Nibbler," In a thousand years, I'll get right on it.
",44,64,4,10,Fry,Narrator13710,Narrator,"  And so, a thousand years later, Fry once again infiltrated the Infosphere and set off his amazing bomb. Only this time...
",124,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13711,Nibbler," Thank you for saving the universe, Fry.  Here.
",48,64,4,10,Narrator,Fry13712,Fry," Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour again, just ask.
",59,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13713,Nibbler," Oh, we will. We will.
",23,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13714,Fry," Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what happened.
",51,64,4,10,Nibbler,Nibbler13715,Nibbler," Uh, yes. Incidentally, I need to remain undercover so I'm blanking your memory.
",81,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13716,Fry," Huh. Did everything just taste purple for a second? Oh, well. Let's go home, you dumb poop machine.
",101,64,4,10,Nibbler,Leela13717,Leela," Bender, would you do the honours?
",35,64,4,10,Fry,Bender13718,Bender," With gusto.
",13,64,4,10,Leela,Fry13719,Fry," Hey, Leela. I guess I got this for you.
",41,64,4,10,Bender,Leela13720,Leela," Oh. Thank you. You know what, Fry? I don't care if you're not the most important person in the universe. It really makes me happy to see you right now.
",153,64,4,10,Fry,Fry13721,Fry," Then I am the most important person in the universe.
",54,64,4,10,Leela,Fry13722,Fry,"  Yes!
",7,64,4,10,Fry,Shatner13723,Shatner,"  Shatner's log, airdate ... unknown.
",38,65,4,11,Fry,Shatner13724,Shatner," The impossible has happened. It would take days to recount the events I have witnessed. So, settle in. It all began--
",119,65,4,11,Shatner,Zapp13725,Zapp," Quiet, you! This court martial is now in session. The honourably sexy Zapp Brannigan residing. Bring in the accused.
",118,65,4,11,Shatner,George Takei13726,George Takei," Oh, my!
",9,65,4,11,Zapp,Zapp13727,Zapp," Philip J. Fry, you stand accused of travelling to the forbidden planet, Omega 3, a crime punishable by 12 concurrent death sentences. Do you understand the charges?
",166,65,4,11,George Takei,Kif13728,Kif," One beep for ""yes"", two beeps for ""no"".
",41,65,4,11,Zapp,Zapp13729,Zapp," ""Yes"". So noted. Do you plead guilty?  Double ""yes"". Guilty! I will now carry out the punishment. Kif, my gun.
",112,65,4,11,Kif,Leela13730,Leela," Wait! He pled ""not guilty"".
",29,65,4,11,Zapp,Zapp13731,Zapp," Order!  Order in the court! Very well then, Mr. Fry. Please recount the events that led you to be guilty.
",107,65,4,11,Leela,Leela13732,Leela," The Professor said he was taking a brief nap, so we only have time for six movies.
",84,65,4,11,Zapp,Bender13733,Bender," Let's take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them.
",62,65,4,11,Leela,Fry13734,Fry," You know what movies average out to be really good? The first six Star Trek movies!
",85,65,4,11,Bender,Clerk13735,Clerk,"  Everybody hit the deck!
",26,65,4,11,Fry,Leela13736,Leela,"  Sh! Those words are forbidden!
",33,65,4,11,Clerk,Fry13737,Fry," What words? Star Trek?
",24,65,4,11,Leela,Leela13738,Leela," Sh!
",5,65,4,11,Fry,Zoidberg13739,Zoidberg," Shut your gills!
",18,65,4,11,Leela,Bender13740,Bender," That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide him!
",44,65,4,11,Zoidberg,Zapp13741,Zapp," The court is intrigued. Perhaps we could hear more about these forbidden words from someone with a sexily seductive voice.
",124,65,4,11,Bender,George Takei13742,George Takei," With pleasure. You see, the show was banned after the Star Trek wars.
",71,65,4,11,Zapp,Zapp13743,Zapp," You mean the vast migration of Star Wars fans?
",48,65,4,11,George Takei,Nichols13744,Nichols," No, that was the Star Wars trek.  By the 23rd century, Star Trek fandom had evolved from a loose association of nerds with skin problems into a full-blown religion.
",166,65,4,11,Zapp,Priest13745,Priest,"  And Scotty beamed them to the Klingon ship where they would be no Tribble at all.
",84,65,4,11,Nichols,Congregation13746,Congregation,"  All power to the engines.
",28,65,4,11,Priest,Nichols13747,Nichols," As country after country fell under its influence, world leaders became threatened by the movements power.  And so the Trekkies were executed in the manner most befitting virgins.
",181,65,4,11,Congregation,Man #113748,Man #1,"  He's dead, Jim!  He's dead, Jim!  He's dead, Jim!
",52,65,4,11,Nichols,Nichols13749,Nichols," Finally, the sacred texts were banned.
",40,65,4,11,Man #1,George Takei13750,George Takei," The last copies of the 79 episodes and six movies were dumped on the forbidden world, Omega 3, along with that blooper reel where the door doesn't close all the way.
",167,65,4,11,Nichols,Nimoy13751,Nimoy," Thus, Star Trek was forever scoured from human memory.
",56,65,4,11,George Takei,Bender13752,Bender," Another classic science-fiction show cancelled before its time.
",65,65,4,11,Nimoy,Zapp13753,Zapp," I've never heard of such a brutal and shocking injustice that I cared so little about. Next witness.
",102,65,4,11,Bender,Kif13754,Kif," Bender the robot, please take the stand.
",42,65,4,11,Zapp,Fry13755,Fry," She's all yours, buddy!
",25,65,4,11,Kif,Bender13756,Bender," I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good.
",73,65,4,11,Fry,Zapp13757,Zapp," Please use the beeps.
",23,65,4,11,Bender,Fry13758,Fry," Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago. I can't believe your show was banned.
",105,65,4,11,Zapp,Nimoy13759,Nimoy," I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
",54,65,4,11,Fry,Fry13760,Fry," You know. 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 good ones.
",50,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nimoy13761,Nimoy," Oh, really, I've done too many things to remember one particular TV series. But if-if you want to discuss my books of poetry--
",128,65,4,11,Fry,Fry13762,Fry," Come on! Remember that episode where you got high on spores and smacked Kirk around?
",86,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nimoy13763,Nimoy," No. Perhaps you're thinking of my one man show about Vincent van Spock-- Uh, uh, I mean van Gogh! Damn!
",105,65,4,11,Fry,Fry13764,Fry," Aha! You can't escape it!
",27,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nimoy13765,Nimoy,"  Oh, you're right, I can't.
",29,65,4,11,Fry,Fry13766,Fry," Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK, I outwitted you, but--
",63,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nimoy13767,Nimoy,"  No, it's my fellow cast members. 300 years ago they left Earth behind.
",73,65,4,11,Fry,Shatner13768,Shatner," This planet doesn't appreciate us anymore, Leonard.
",53,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nimoy13769,Nimoy," Bill, you are, and always shall be, my friend. But I just signed a six-month lease on my apartment. I can't walk away from a commitment like that.
",148,65,4,11,Shatner,Shatner13770,Shatner," Very well, my friend.
",23,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nimoy13771,Nimoy,"  Why did the world turn it's back on our obvious greatness?
",61,65,4,11,Shatner,Fry13772,Fry," I'm literally angry with rage! Your co-stars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see. Come on!
",141,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nimoy13773,Nimoy," Oh!
",5,65,4,11,Fry,Frakes13774,Frakes," Yes! Front row!
",17,65,4,11,Nimoy,Leela13775,Leela," You can't go to Omega 3; it's forbidden! I forbid you!
",56,65,4,11,Frakes,Fry13776,Fry," But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future.
",79,65,4,11,Leela,Leela13777,Leela," But it's set 800 years in the past!
",37,65,4,11,Fry,Bender13778,Bender," Yeah, why is this so important to you?
",40,65,4,11,Leela,Fry13779,Fry," 'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people, whether they be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly, when I didn't have any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did.
",210,65,4,11,Bender,Leela13780,Leela," Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone.
",70,65,4,11,Fry,Bender13781,Bender," I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, of course.
",52,65,4,11,Leela,Leela13782,Leela," We're entering the Omega system.
",34,65,4,11,Bender,Computer Voice13783,Computer Voice," Warning: You are now in forbidden space.
",42,65,4,11,Leela,Bender13784,Bender," Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they gonna do, write a letter?  Ooh, I'm so scared!
",88,65,4,11,Computer Voice,Leela13785,Leela," I've lost control of the ship!
",32,65,4,11,Bender,Fry13786,Fry," Oh, dip!
",10,65,4,11,Leela,Nimoy13787,Nimoy," Dip, indeed!
",14,65,4,11,Fry,Fry13788,Fry," It's all stuff from that forbidden show.
",42,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nimoy13789,Nimoy," So many cardboard sets, so many memories. If only the others--
",64,65,4,11,Fry,Shatner13790,Shatner," I guess that's my cue.
",24,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nimoy13791,Nimoy," Bill!
",7,65,4,11,Shatner,Shatner13792,Shatner," L-Dog!
",8,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nimoy13793,Nimoy,"  Hey! This is wonderful!
",26,65,4,11,Shatner,Shatner13794,Shatner," Oh, man.
",10,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nimoy13795,Nimoy," I feel like hugging you.
",26,65,4,11,Shatner,Shatner13796,Shatner," Well I would except you have no body!  And we're both men.
",60,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nimoy13797,Nimoy," Nichelle! George! Walter! DeForest!  Welshie!
",47,65,4,11,Shatner,Fry13798,Fry," Welshie?
",10,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nichols13799,Nichols," We did some musical reunion specials in the 2200's but the guy who played Scotty had trouble yodelling.
",105,65,4,11,Fry,George Takei13800,George Takei," Ever since then, Welshie has been a welcome participant in our escapades.
",75,65,4,11,Nichols,Fry13801,Fry," I can't believe it! How'd you all end up here?
",48,65,4,11,George Takei,Shatner13802,Shatner," We were on our way to Welshie's cousin's house to stay in the guest room when our ship was pulled down to this planet and crashed, just like yours.
",149,65,4,11,Fry,Koenig13803,Koenig," When we woke up, we had these bodies.
",39,65,4,11,Shatner,Fry13804,Fry," Say it in Russian!
",20,65,4,11,Koenig,Koenig13805,Koenig," Ven vee voke up vee had these wodies.
",39,65,4,11,Fry,Fry13806,Fry," Now say ""nuclear wessels""!
",28,65,4,11,Koenig,Koenig13807,Koenig," No!
",5,65,4,11,Fry,George Takei13808,George Takei," You'll love it here. Everything is provided for us, and we never age. Check out these abs!
",92,65,4,11,Koenig,Bender13809,Bender," Yowza!
",8,65,4,11,George Takei,Leela13810,Leela," But who's doing all this for you?
",35,65,4,11,Bender,Shatner13811,Shatner," You know, we never thought about it. We're famous celebrities -- we're used to this sort of treatment.
",104,65,4,11,Leela,Melllvar13812,Melllvar," It is I!
",10,65,4,11,Shatner,Bender13813,Bender," Whoa! What a cheesy effect!
",29,65,4,11,Melllvar,Melllvar13814,Melllvar," I am not an effect! You doubt my power?
",41,65,4,11,Bender,Bender13815,Bender," I do.
",7,65,4,11,Melllvar,Welshie13816,Welshie,"  Aye!
",7,65,4,11,Bender,Fry13817,Fry,"  Welshie!
",11,65,4,11,Welshie,Zapp13818,Zapp," This court will now hear some very sensual testimony from this court's ex-lover, Turanga Leela.
",97,65,4,11,Fry,Leela13819,Leela," Go  yourself.
",15,65,4,11,Zapp,Melllvar13820,Melllvar," Behold another power, different from the one you saw earlier.
",63,65,4,11,Leela,Nimoy13821,Nimoy," Hey, a body! Buff, tan. Yeah, this is mine, alright!
",54,65,4,11,Melllvar,Fry13822,Fry," Alright, you gas, what's the deal?
",36,65,4,11,Nimoy,Melllvar13823,Melllvar," Centuries ago, the videotaped adventures of the Enterprise crew rained down upon my planet. Over and over, I watched them. Especially the five with the energy beings. I am Melllvar! Seer of the tapes, knower of the episodes! Tremble before my encyclopaedic knowledge of Star Trek!
",282,65,4,11,Fry,Fry13824,Fry," Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me!
",62,65,4,11,Melllvar,Melllvar13825,Melllvar," I beg to differ.  Long have I waited for the one who played Spock. At last, we can begin.
",91,65,4,11,Fry,Fry13826,Fry," Cool! A Star Trek convention!
",31,65,4,11,Melllvar,Nimoy13827,Nimoy," Uh, Melllvar, can you give us some idea of how long this is going to last?
",76,65,4,11,Fry,Melllvar13828,Melllvar," Until time stops.
",19,65,4,11,Nimoy,Leela13829,Leela," What?
",7,65,4,11,Melllvar,Shatner13830,Shatner," He can't do this!
",19,65,4,11,Leela,Nimoy13831,Nimoy," You can't be serious!
",23,65,4,11,Shatner,Melllvar13832,Melllvar," Now, we have a full schedule of events--
",42,65,4,11,Nimoy,Bender13833,Bender," Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?
",42,65,4,11,Melllvar,Koenig13834,Koenig," Good question!
",16,65,4,11,Bender,Melllvar13835,Melllvar," No, you have to stay even longer.
",35,65,4,11,Koenig,Melllvar13836,Melllvar," Um, uh, sign it to Melllvar. ""Melllvar"" has three ""L's"".
",58,65,4,11,Melllvar,George Takei13837,George Takei," I think I've done enough conventions to know how to spell ""Melllvar"".
",71,65,4,11,Melllvar,Bender13838,Bender," Say ""nerd""!
",13,65,4,11,George Takei,All13839,All," Nerd!
",7,65,4,11,Bender,Shatner13840,Shatner,"  I'm Slim Shady,
Yes, I'm the real Shady,
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating,
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up.
",169,65,4,11,All,Koenig13841,Koenig," How can you do a spoken-word version of a rap song?
",53,65,4,11,Shatner,Melllvar13842,Melllvar," He found a way.
",17,65,4,11,Koenig,Leela13843,Leela," For one hundred quatloos: Who did the captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?
",71,65,4,11,Melllvar,Shatner13844,Shatner,"  Khaaan!
",10,65,4,11,Leela,Fry13845,Fry," Uh ... Khan?
",14,65,4,11,Shatner,Leela13846,Leela," Correct.
",10,65,4,11,Fry,Melllvar13847,Melllvar," My button has broken. The trivia contest has ended. I-I now have a surprise. You will perform a fan script, written by the ultimate Trek fan.
",143,65,4,11,Leela,Fry13848,Fry," You have my fan script?
",25,65,4,11,Melllvar,Melllvar13849,Melllvar," I meant me! Melllvar is the ultimate fan!
",43,65,4,11,Fry,Fry13850,Fry,"  Oh, I was confused because the scoreboard says something different.
",70,65,4,11,Melllvar,Melllvar13851,Melllvar," Trivia contest over! Take your scripts!  We have limited rehearsal time. Now, I didn't make enough copies of the script, so George and Walter will have to share.
",163,65,4,11,Fry,Leela13852,Leela," Uh, you probably don't want us to see you rehearsing, or it'll give away the ending.
",86,65,4,11,Melllvar,Melllvar13853,Melllvar," That's right! The ending must not be ruined.
",46,65,4,11,Leela,Leela13854,Leela," We'll go wait in the ship.
",28,65,4,11,Melllvar,Melllvar13855,Melllvar," OK.
",5,65,4,11,Leela,Fry13856,Fry," Not till I get my 600 quatloos!
",33,65,4,11,Melllvar,Fry13857,Fry," This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned them there.
",56,65,4,11,Fry,Bender13858,Bender," I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about it.
",44,65,4,11,Fry,Leela13859,Leela," I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, but what are we supposed to do?
",72,65,4,11,Bender,Fry13860,Fry," Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy.
",112,65,4,11,Leela,Leela13861,Leela," Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum structure.
",164,65,4,11,Fry,Bender13862,Bender," Like putting too much air in a balloon!
",41,65,4,11,Leela,Fry13863,Fry," Of course! It's so simple!
",28,65,4,11,Bender,Shatner13864,Shatner,"  Alas, my ship, whom I love like a woman, is ... disabled.  Oh, Lord!
",71,65,4,11,Fry,Nimoy13865,Nimoy,"  Fascinating, Captain, and logical too, that we need some help.
",65,65,4,11,Shatner,George Takei13866,George Takei,"  Look, Captain, Melllvar will help us.
",40,65,4,11,Nimoy,Koenig13867,Koenig,"  Keptin, I wope he will welp our ... vessel.
",46,65,4,11,George Takei,Melllvar13868,Melllvar," Wessel!  You're not acting hard enough!
",41,65,4,11,Koenig,Nimoy13869,Nimoy," Melllvar, you have to respect your actors. When I directed Star Trek IV I got a magnificent performance out of Bill because I respected him so much.
",150,65,4,11,Melllvar,Shatner13870,Shatner," And when I directed Star Trek V I got a magnificent performance out of me, because I respected me so much!
",108,65,4,11,Nimoy,Bender13871,Bender,"  OK! I'm done re-kafoobling the energy motron ... or whatever.
",64,65,4,11,Shatner,Leela13872,Leela," Fire!
",7,65,4,11,Bender,Nichols13873,Nichols,"  My, what a handsome energy creature you are. I love you.  Hey, you wrote it!
",79,65,4,11,Leela,Leela13874,Leela," It's not working! He's drawing straight from our weapons.
",59,65,4,11,Nichols,Fry13875,Fry," Like a balloon and ... something bad happens.
",47,65,4,11,Leela,Bender13876,Bender," Yup!
",6,65,4,11,Fry,Leela13877,Leela," So, uh, how's rehearsal going?
",32,65,4,11,Bender,Melllvar13878,Melllvar," Lousy. Here I've been admiring a bunch of actors while you, a crew of genuine space heroes, risked your lives to save them.
",125,65,4,11,Leela,Nimoy13879,Nimoy," Hey! We've done heroic things too.
",36,65,4,11,Melllvar,Nichols13880,Nichols," Yeah! In the third season I kissed Shatner!
",45,65,4,11,Nimoy,Melllvar13881,Melllvar," Silence! My whole world has turned upside-down. I have but one option.
",72,65,4,11,Nichols,Koenig13882,Koenig," Keep them and let us go?
",26,65,4,11,Melllvar,Melllvar13883,Melllvar," No! To determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion I shall pit you together against each other in armed combat ... to the death!
",140,65,4,11,Koenig,Bender13884,Bender," Where'd you get an idiotic idea like that?
",44,65,4,11,Melllvar,Melllvar13885,Melllvar," Episodes 19, 46, 56 and 77.
",29,65,4,11,Bender,Fry13886,Fry," Great list. Except, you forgot episode 66!
",44,65,4,11,Melllvar,Melllvar13887,Melllvar," I was getting to that one!
",28,65,4,11,Fry,Zapp13888,Zapp," So Melllvar ordered a battle to the death. I assume no one survived.
",70,65,4,11,Melllvar,Leela13889,Leela," Can we get on with this? My foot's getting tired!
",51,65,4,11,Zapp,Melllvar13890,Melllvar," This will be your standard battle to the death. The only weapons: Whatever you can find. But I warn you, do nothing until I have signalled the start of combat. OK, start.
",172,65,4,11,Leela,Koenig13891,Koenig," I don't have much experience at fighting -- except with you guys.
",67,65,4,11,Melllvar,Shatner13892,Shatner," I have an idea. Wasn't there an episode where I threw my shoe at the enemy?
",77,65,4,11,Koenig,Nimoy13893,Nimoy," You mean Doohan?
",18,65,4,11,Shatner,Shatner13894,Shatner," Whoever it was, I did it like this.
",37,65,4,11,Nimoy,George Takei13895,George Takei," Ow!
",5,65,4,11,Shatner,Shatner13896,Shatner," My foot's cold!
",17,65,4,11,George Takei,Leela13897,Leela," There. We can make these into spears.
",39,65,4,11,Shatner,Fry13898,Fry," And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows.
",85,65,4,11,Leela,Bender13899,Bender," And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw!  That was fun!
",72,65,4,11,Fry,Nichols13900,Nichols," What if I distract them with my famous fan dance?
",51,65,4,11,Bender,Shatner13901,Shatner," Oh, that's good, good, good, good. And then, George, you give them a karate chop!
",83,65,4,11,Nichols,George Takei13902,George Takei," I find that offensive. Just because I'm of Japanese ancestry you assume I know karate. Have I ever led you to believe I've studied karate?
",140,65,4,11,Shatner,Shatner13903,Shatner," Well, no, but you never talk about yourself.
",46,65,4,11,George Takei,George Takei13904,George Takei,"  Maybe if you showed a little interest.
",41,65,4,11,Shatner,Fry13905,Fry," Well, here goes nothing.
",26,65,4,11,George Takei,Nichols13906,Nichols,"  Hello, boys!
",15,65,4,11,Fry,Bender13907,Bender," Whoa!
",7,65,4,11,Nichols,George Takei13908,George Takei," Hi-yah!
",9,65,4,11,Bender,Shatner13909,Shatner," There's no right way to hit a woman.
",38,65,4,11,George Takei,Leela13910,Leela," Then do it the wrong way.
",27,65,4,11,Shatner,Shatner13911,Shatner," Fine. Yah!
",12,65,4,11,Leela,Leela13912,Leela," Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!
",33,65,4,11,Shatner,Shatner13913,Shatner," See you in h--
",16,65,4,11,Leela,Bender13914,Bender," Come on, Walter!
",18,65,4,11,Shatner,Nimoy13915,Nimoy," Take that!
",12,65,4,11,Bender,Fry13916,Fry," It hurts!
",11,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nimoy13917,Nimoy," Let's see if this actually works!  Hm.  Ow! Ow! Ow!
",53,65,4,11,Fry,Koenig13918,Koenig," My face!
",10,65,4,11,Nimoy,George Takei13919,George Takei," Ow! My face too!
",18,65,4,11,Koenig,Shatner13920,Shatner," May I?  Oh!
",13,65,4,11,George Takei,Melllvar13921,Melllvar," Excellent! Excellent!
",23,65,4,11,Shatner,Shatner13922,Shatner," Leela, please. This is exactly what Melllvar wants. We're just pawns in his diabolical game of checkers. Can't we resolve our differences some other way?
",155,65,4,11,Melllvar,Melllvars Mother13923,Melllvars Mother," Melllvar! Dinner time!
",24,65,4,11,Shatner,Melllvar13924,Melllvar," Aw, but Mom, I'm playing with my collectables!
",48,65,4,11,Melllvars Mother,Melllvars Mother13925,Melllvars Mother," Now!
",6,65,4,11,Melllvar,Fry13926,Fry," All this time we thought he was a powerful super-being, yet he was just a child.
",82,65,4,11,Melllvars Mother,Melllvars Mother13927,Melllvars Mother," He's not a child, he's 34!
",28,65,4,11,Fry,Bender13928,Bender," Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this for years!
",52,65,4,11,Melllvars Mother,Fry13929,Fry," Bender, wait! This is our chance to escape, before Melllvar comes back. But we all need to work together.
",107,65,4,11,Bender,Shatner13930,Shatner," I love you so much!
",21,65,4,11,Fry,Nimoy13931,Nimoy," Hello?
",8,65,4,11,Shatner,Fry13932,Fry," We've decided to work together.
",33,65,4,11,Nimoy,Nimoy13933,Nimoy," Uh, so did they.
",18,65,4,11,Fry,Shatner13934,Shatner," Now, how do we escape?
",24,65,4,11,Nimoy,Leela13935,Leela," We can't use our ship; we have life support but the engines are wrecked.
",74,65,4,11,Shatner,George Takei13936,George Takei," Ironic, because our engines work but our life support systems don't.
",70,65,4,11,Leela,Leela13937,Leela," Hey, if your engines work--
",29,65,4,11,George Takei,George Takei13938,George Takei," And your life support systems work--
",38,65,4,11,Leela,Fry13939,Fry," Stop! You're just goin' around in circles!  Think, Fry, think! Everyone's depending on you.
",93,65,4,11,George Takei,Leela13940,Leela," We're too heavy. You guys need to lose some weight, fast!
",59,65,4,11,Fry,Fry13941,Fry," Look, Leonard, we're light enough to keep the tapes! Isn't that great?
",72,65,4,11,Leela,Nimoy13942,Nimoy," I'm living in a gefilte fish jar.
",35,65,4,11,Fry,Fry13943,Fry," We did it!
",12,65,4,11,Nimoy,Fry13944,Fry," Melllvar's got a spaceship!
",29,65,4,11,Fry,Melllvar13945,Melllvar,"  Yes, in mint condition. And you made me take it out of the package!
",70,65,4,11,Fry,Leela13946,Leela," The Nimbus! We're saved!
",26,65,4,11,Melllvar,Zapp13947,Zapp,"  You're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded.
",46,65,4,11,Leela,Zapp13948,Zapp," So I boarded you, eh? What happened next?
",43,65,4,11,Zapp,Leela13949,Leela," You started this stupid court martial. Now if you don't mind, we're still fighting Melllvar!
",94,65,4,11,Zapp,Leela13950,Leela," One more hit and we're done for!
",34,65,4,11,Leela,George Takei13951,George Takei," Let's take 'em out with us. Do you guys have a self-destruct code? Like ""destruct sequence 1-A, 2-B, 3--""
",107,65,4,11,Leela,Bender13952,Bender," Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!
",43,65,4,11,George Takei,Melllvar13953,Melllvar,"  If I can't have the original cast of Star Trek, no one will! Prepare to die!
",79,65,4,11,Bender,Fry13954,Fry," Wait! If they mean that much to you, why do you wanna kill them?
",66,65,4,11,Melllvar,Melllvar13955,Melllvar,"  Because I ... I ... I dunno what I'd do without them.
",56,65,4,11,Fry,Fry13956,Fry," Melllvar, you can't let a TV show be your whole life. You can do anything you want. Look at Walter Koenig: After Star Trek, he became an actor.
",145,65,4,11,Melllvar,Koenig13957,Koenig," Not just an actor, but a well-rounded person, with my own friends and credit cards and keys.
",94,65,4,11,Fry,Melllvar13958,Melllvar,"  Well, I guess I could move out of my parents' basement ... maybe get a temp job.
",83,65,4,11,Koenig,Fry13959,Fry," Whoa, whoa! One step at a time.
",33,65,4,11,Melllvar,Melllvar13960,Melllvar,"  I thank you, Fry. You know, you and I are of a kind. In a different reality I could have called you ""friend"".
",112,65,4,11,Fry,Fry13961,Fry," Episode 10, Balance of Terror.
",32,65,4,11,Melllvar,Melllvar13962,Melllvar,"  More like episode nine, loser! In your face! Victory is mine!
",64,65,4,11,Fry,Shatner13963,Shatner," I wonder, my friends, was he really such an evil energy gas?
",62,65,4,11,Melllvar,Nichols13964,Nichols," He did give us eternal youth.
",31,65,4,11,Shatner,Koenig13965,Koenig," 24-hour Laundromat.
",21,65,4,11,Nichols,George Takei13966,George Takei," A full assortment of rum, both spiced and regular.
",52,65,4,11,Koenig,Nimoy13967,Nimoy," Truly, it was a paradise.
",27,65,4,11,George Takei,Fry13968,Fry," And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan.
",71,65,4,11,Nimoy,Shatner13969,Shatner," Let's get the hell outta here!
",32,65,4,11,Fry,Bender13970,Bender," A hush comes over the crowd. The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk as he swings!  Oh, he slices! Into the water! Oh, man!   Boy, I tell you, buddy!
",165,66,4,12,Shatner,Farnsworth13971,Farnsworth," Bad news, everyone. You're not good enough to go on your next mission.
",72,66,4,12,Bender,Fry13972,Fry," Hooray!
",9,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Bender13973,Bender," Not good enough!
",18,66,4,12,Fry,Leela13974,Leela," Why? Says who?
",16,66,4,12,Bender,Farnsworth13975,Farnsworth," Because. And says me. It's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew. And you're not nearly as good as them.
",124,66,4,12,Leela,Fry13976,Fry," Woo-hoo!
",10,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Bender13977,Bender," We live to suck another day!
",30,66,4,12,Fry,Leela13978,Leela," We're just as good as any of those other crews you sent to their deaths. What's the mission?
",94,66,4,12,Bender,Farnsworth13979,Farnsworth," Collecting honey. Ordinary honey.
",35,66,4,12,Leela,Leela13980,Leela," That doesn't sound so dangerous.
",34,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13981,Farnsworth," This is no ordinary honey! It's produced by vicious space bees. A single sting of their hideous neuro-toxin can cause instant death.
",134,66,4,12,Leela,Hermes13982,Hermes," And that's if you're not allergic. You don't wanna know what happens then. Oh, no, no. God, no!
",97,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13983,Farnsworth," Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano.
",77,66,4,12,Hermes,Hermes13984,Hermes," I didn't want to know!
",24,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth13985,Farnsworth," These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly.
",59,66,4,12,Hermes,Fry13986,Fry," Larger than an American sedan?  How big is the honeycomb?
",59,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Hermes13987,Hermes," Honeycomb's big. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
",36,66,4,12,Fry,Bender13988,Bender," It's not small?
",17,66,4,12,Hermes,Hermes13989,Hermes," No, no, no.
",13,66,4,12,Bender,Leela13990,Leela," It'll take more than deadly, deadly bees to keep us from doing our job. Come on, boys.
",88,66,4,12,Hermes,Fry13991,Fry," But, Leela, we're no good.
",28,66,4,12,Leela,Leela13992,Leela," Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of disappointing myself.
",70,66,4,12,Fry,Fry13993,Fry," I'm not scared of that at all.
",32,66,4,12,Leela,Leela13994,Leela," Now, bees communicate by dancing.
",35,66,4,12,Fry,Fry13995,Fry," Like my parents! Oh, wait, that was hitting.
",46,66,4,12,Leela,Leela13996,Leela," So this language cartridge will let you distract them.
",56,66,4,12,Fry,Bender13997,Bender," Ah, good. I often have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance.   You stink. Bender's great. Deal with it.
",131,66,4,12,Leela,Leela13998,Leela," Bender, quick! Waggle something!
",34,66,4,12,Bender,Bender13999,Bender," Uh ...  Hello, fellow bees. How's the abdomen? Swollen with nectar, I trust?
",78,66,4,12,Leela,Bee #114000,Bee #1,"  Duh!
",7,66,4,12,Bender,Fry14001,Fry," Leela, let's turn back. There's absolutely no shame in wussing out.
",69,66,4,12,Bee #1,Leela14002,Leela," Relax. Everything'll be fine.
",31,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14003,Fry," Oh, my God! The old Planet Express ship.
",42,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14004,Leela," There's the black box.
",24,66,4,12,Fry,Man #114005,Man #1,"  Captain, the bees have us surrounded! Oh, the Professor was right. We're not as good as his old crew!
",104,66,4,12,Leela,Captain14006,Captain,"  Well I aim to prove him wrong. It'll take more than a few deadly, deadly bees to--   OH, LORD!!
",98,66,4,12,Man #1,Leela14007,Leela," Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much static.
",46,66,4,12,Captain,Bender14008,Bender," Ew!
",5,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14009,Leela," We found it! The honeycomb hideout.
",37,66,4,12,Bender,Fry14010,Fry," Hey, what's this goop?
",24,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14011,Leela," Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.
",41,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14012,Fry," Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How come nothing humans make tastes good?  Help! I can't swim in jelly, as far as I know!
",123,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14013,Leela," Look!  It's a baby queen! Aw, she's so cute! You adorable wittle, itty-bitty, fuzzy-wuzzy--
",93,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14014,Fry," Leela! Stop bonding and let's go! I got jelly in my underpants!
",65,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14015,Leela," I'm taking this bee with us. With a queen we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch and we'll go.
",137,66,4,12,Fry,Bender14016,Bender,"  Pick up the pace, lady! I'm sick of shaking my booty for these fat jerks.  I didn't mean you're all fat. Just fatso there.
",125,66,4,12,Leela,Bee #114017,Bee #1,"  He insulted our fat queen!
",29,66,4,12,Bender,Queen14018,Queen,"  You try keeping your figure after 10,000 kids!
",49,66,4,12,Bee #1,Leela14019,Leela," This is where we distinguish ourselves from the last crew. Activate emergency high-speed self-contained escape pack crisis response unit. Quick!
",146,66,4,12,Queen,Leela14020,Leela,"  Good luck, Bender!
",21,66,4,12,Leela,Bender14021,Bender," I'm back, baby!
",17,66,4,12,Leela,Fry14022,Fry," We made it! We're alive!
",26,66,4,12,Bender,Leela14023,Leela," Burn on that old crew! The only things they did better than us were suck and die!
",83,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14024,Fry," Leela, we got lucky this time. But you should be more careful. I don't want anything to happen to you.
",104,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14025,Leela," Thanks, but I can look out for myself. Frankly, I can smell danger a mile away.
",81,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14026,Fry," Look out!  You want her, you're gonna have to go through me!
",62,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14027,Leela," You call that a wound? That's a boo-boo tops. But thanks for trying to save me, Fry.   Fry?!  He's... he's dead!
",114,66,4,12,Fry,Bender14028,Bender,"  Who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now?
",63,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14029,Leela,"  It was all my fault! He died because of me!
",46,66,4,12,Bender,Farnsworth14030,Farnsworth,"  No, no, no, no, no, no.   I'm lying to make her feel better!
",63,66,4,12,Leela,Labarbara14031,Labarbara," Husband, can't you go anywhere without lighting something up?
",63,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Hermes14032,Hermes," It's an old Jamaican accounting tradition. We burn his timecard. That way his zombie doesn't come back looking for his final paycheck.
",136,66,4,12,Labarbara,Amy14033,Amy," He looks so natural. It's funny to think he's clammed full of sawdust and preservatives.
",90,66,4,12,Hermes,Zoidberg14034,Zoidberg," I only wish I could have removed the stinger.
",47,66,4,12,Amy,Changstein el Gamahl14035,Changstein el Gamahl," I barely knew Philip. But, as a clergyman, I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
",111,66,4,12,Zoidberg,Hermes14036,Hermes," Soothe us with sweet lies.
",28,66,4,12,Changstein el Gamahl,Changstein el Gamahl14037,Changstein el Gamahl," It may comfort you to know Fry's death took only 15 seconds. Yet the pain was so intense that it felt to him like 15 years. And it goes without saying it caused him to empty his bowels.  We now commend Fry's body to the ages.
",227,66,4,12,Hermes,Amy14038,Amy," He's walking on sunshine now.
",31,66,4,12,Changstein el Gamahl,Farnsworth14039,Farnsworth," This makes me the oldest member of my family.
",47,66,4,12,Amy,Kug14040,Kug," Him do good snu-snu.
",22,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Bender14041,Bender," All those times I said ""Kill all humans,"" I'd always whisper ""except one"". Fry was that one.  And I never told him so!
",120,66,4,12,Kug,Terry14042,Terry,"  Farewell, from the world of tomorrow!
",40,66,4,12,Bender,Leela14043,Leela,"  They say a spoonful of space honey helps ease the pain.  Mmm... It's good.  I feel funny. Ha-ha funny!
",105,66,4,12,Terry,Fry14044,Fry," Leela?
",8,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14045,Leela," Fry? I thought you were dead.
",31,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14046,Fry," Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the accident I couldn't do this!
",69,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14047,Leela," Impressive! But it does sorta support my you-are-dead theory.
",63,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14048,Fry," Then I'll prove I'm alive, by telling you something only I could know.  There's a surprise for you in my locker. I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left.
",165,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14049,Leela," It's too beautiful to open. Can I open it?
",44,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14050,Fry," Sure. There's just one thing I want you to do.
",48,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14051,Leela," What?
",7,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14052,Fry," I want you to wake up.
",24,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14053,Leela," Wake up? But I'm not--
",24,66,4,12,Fry,Leela14054,Leela," In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in his locker. If it's true then he must still exist in some form.
",110,66,4,12,Leela,Farnsworth14055,Farnsworth," Of course he still exists: As a frozen corpse in outer space!  Oh, I made myself sad.
",87,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14056,Leela," Well, here goes.
",18,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Zoidberg14057,Zoidberg," Bupkis!
",9,66,4,12,Leela,Bender14058,Bender," Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped give me closure.
",88,66,4,12,Zoidberg,Leela14059,Leela," Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?
",65,66,4,12,Bender,Bender14060,Bender," No. Nothing. Not at all. No way, JosÃ©!  Here it is.
",53,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14061,Leela," You took this from Fry's locker?
",34,66,4,12,Bender,Bender14062,Bender," Hey, the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing.
",60,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14063,Leela," That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams.
",75,66,4,12,Bender,Farnsworth14064,Farnsworth," Bull pies!
",12,66,4,12,Leela,Farnsworth14065,Farnsworth," Lay down here and we'll do some tests. If Fry is out there then Leela's brain could be acting as a five-pound Ouija board.
",124,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Leela14066,Leela," Is this some sort of brain scanner?
",37,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14067,Farnsworth," Some sort, yes. In France it's called a guillotine.
",53,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14068,Leela," Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?
",60,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14069,Farnsworth," Yes, easily.
",14,66,4,12,Leela,Bender14070,Bender," Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like Julia Roberts?
",86,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14071,Farnsworth," Well, I suppose there's a slim--  I don't believe it!
",55,66,4,12,Bender,Leela14072,Leela," What is it? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something?
",64,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14073,Farnsworth," No. According to this gizmometer, Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back. Remarkable!
",91,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14074,Leela," But ... my dream. Your science can't unprove that! How could I have known the gift was in Fry's locker?
",105,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Hermes14075,Hermes," Easy! He told you about it before he died and your grief-roasted mind blocked it out.
",87,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14076,Leela," Are you saying I'm going crazy?
",33,66,4,12,Hermes,Farnsworth14077,Farnsworth," No, no! No one's saying that. But I'm certainly thinking it loudly.
",69,66,4,12,Leela,Fry14078,Fry," Hi, Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, even if you can't hear me. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
",116,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Leela14079,Leela," Shut up! I can hear you. The Professor says you're just a dream.
",66,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14080,Fry," Oh, yeah?  Could a dream take you dancing in a Venusian garden?
",65,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14081,Leela," Well, yes, technically. But it's still very sweet of you.
",59,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14082,Fry," Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hyperion?
",73,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14083,Leela," Oh, Fry! You must be alive; I've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before.
",99,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14084,Fry," Here, take my jacket. You look a little cold.
",47,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14085,Leela," Thank you. It's all so beautiful. I forgot how many hundreds of degrees below zero it must be. I just wish I could convince the others you're alive.
",150,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14086,Fry," You can. All you have to do is wake up.
",41,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14087,Leela," No, no! Don't say that! This is real!
",39,66,4,12,Fry,Leela14088,Leela," Not another dream!  Fry's jacket! The one he was buried in! My dream was real! He's alive!
",92,66,4,12,Leela,Petunia14089,Petunia,"  Quit your bragging! My boyfriend's alive too!  Not 'nymore!
",62,66,4,12,Leela,Bender14090,Bender," That's better!
",16,66,4,12,Petunia,Leela14091,Leela," Fry's alive! I have proof!
",28,66,4,12,Bender,Amy14092,Amy," No way!
",9,66,4,12,Leela,Farnsworth14093,Farnsworth," You lie!
",10,66,4,12,Amy,Bender14094,Bender," You do not!
",13,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Hermes14095,Hermes," I'm from Jamaica, the ""Show Me"" island. So show me you're blowing it out your fanny.
",86,66,4,12,Bender,Leela14096,Leela," But he gave me his jacket. Look.
",34,66,4,12,Hermes,Farnsworth14097,Farnsworth," That's not Fry's jacket. Fry's jacket is red. That's your jacket. An off-the-rack, lime green affair.
",103,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14098,Leela," But Fry-- His jacket-- And when I woke up it was on me.
",57,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Hermes14099,Hermes," You're under a lot of guilt stress, Leela. Here, work it off.
",63,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14100,Leela,"  I am not under stress, damnit!
",33,66,4,12,Hermes,Amy14101,Amy,"  Everything's going to be alright, Leela.
",43,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14102,Leela," What?
",7,66,4,12,Amy,Amy14103,Amy," I said everything's going to be alright.
",42,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14104,Leela," Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.
",39,66,4,12,Amy,Bender14105,Bender," A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita. And she's a screw!
",65,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14106,Leela," I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey.
",69,66,4,12,Bender,Farnsworth14107,Farnsworth," You've been taking space honey? Be careful, you purple-haired imbecile!
",73,66,4,12,Leela,Zoidberg14108,Zoidberg," One spoonful calms you down. Two spoonfuls help you sleep. But three spoonfuls and you'll go into a sleep so deep you'll never wake up. Never!
",144,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Hermes14109,Hermes,"  Never!
",9,66,4,12,Zoidberg,Bender14110,Bender,"  Never!
",9,66,4,12,Hermes,Leela14111,Leela," One spoonful to calm me down.  OK, I've got a pretty good calm going! Two spoonfuls to help me sleep.  Uh-oh, still awake. I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt.  Oh, my gosh! I'd better get a sponge.  Fry?  Is that you? I don't need a sponge!
",247,66,4,12,Bender,Fry14112,Fry," Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
",54,66,4,12,Leela,Farnsworth14113,Farnsworth," Incredible! According to the gizmometer, Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled on the couch, it recombined with trace amounts of Fry's hair and skin--
",229,66,4,12,Fry,Bender14114,Bender," And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!
",44,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14115,Farnsworth," Yes, Bender, thank you. In short, the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being.
",131,66,4,12,Bender,Fry14116,Fry," Neat!
",7,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Bender14117,Bender," This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again.  Let's go get hammered!
",95,66,4,12,Fry,Zoidberg14118,Zoidberg," I should warn you, I'm a mean drunk.
",38,66,4,12,Bender,Leela14119,Leela," Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you.
",37,66,4,12,Zoidberg,Fry14120,Fry," Me too.
",9,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14121,Leela," Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad. But now everything is alright.
",87,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14122,Fry," Uh, not everything.
",21,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14123,Leela," What? What do you mean?
",25,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14124,Fry," You have to wake up.
",22,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14125,Leela," Wake up? Oh, no! No! It can't be!
",35,66,4,12,Fry,Leela14126,Leela," Pooh!
",7,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14127,Leela," I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive. But when I'm awake, my mind plays tricks on me.
",111,66,4,12,Leela,Hermes14128,Hermes," Oh, take it easy, Leela.
",26,66,4,12,Leela,Amy14129,Amy," In every life we have some trouble.
",37,66,4,12,Hermes,Bender14130,Bender," But when you worry, you make it double.
",41,66,4,12,Amy,Amyand Bender14131,Amyand Bender,"  Don't worry! Bee happy!
",26,66,4,12,Bender,Farnsworth14132,Farnsworth,"  The landlord says your rent is late.
",39,66,4,12,Amyand Bender,Hermes14133,Hermes,"  He might have to litigate.
",29,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Bender14134,Bender,"  But don't worry!
",19,66,4,12,Hermes,Bee #114135,Bee #1,"  Bee--
",8,66,4,12,Bender,Farnsworth14136,Farnsworth,"  Happy!
",9,66,4,12,Bee #1,Zoidberg14137,Zoidberg,"  Ain't got no cash,
Ain't got no style,
Ladies vomit when I smile,
But does Zoidberg worry?
Feh! You wish!
",108,66,4,12,Farnsworth,Bee #114138,Bee #1,"  Bee--
",8,66,4,12,Zoidberg,Zoidberg14139,Zoidberg,"  Happy!
",9,66,4,12,Bee #1,Hermes14140,Hermes," Don't worry now, Amy!
",23,66,4,12,Zoidberg,Amy14141,Amy," OK! I'm happy!
",16,66,4,12,Hermes,Bender14142,Bender," Take us home, Bender!  Don't worry!
",37,66,4,12,Amy,Bee #114143,Bee #1,"  Bee--
",8,66,4,12,Bender,Bender14144,Bender,"  Happy!
",9,66,4,12,Bee #1,Leela14145,Leela," Uh, were you just singing?
",28,66,4,12,Bender,Bender14146,Bender," No, I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing. Court order.
",75,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14147,Leela," I'll find Fry's coffin, get his corpse and keep it under my mattress to remind me that he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane.
",136,66,4,12,Bender,Leela14148,Leela," OK, it's just an ordinary coffin. Containing my ordinary dead friend, who I killed.
",85,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14149,Leela," What happened? Why am I in my apartment?
",42,66,4,12,Leela,"Farnsworth, Zoidberg, Hermes, Amyand Bender"14150,"Farnsworth, Zoidberg, Hermes, Amyand Bender","   You killed Fry! You killed Fry! You killed Fry ...!

",19,66,4,12,"Farnsworth, Zoidberg, Hermes, Amyand Bender",Bender14152,Bender," You killed Fry!
",17,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14153,Leela," OK, I'm insane! But I'm still sane enough to know it.  The only time I feel alright is in my dreams, with you.  Three spoonfuls. Then I can dream forever.  One. Two  Here goes. Goodbye, waking world.
",201,66,4,12,Bender,Frys Photo14154,Frys Photo," Leela! No!  Listen to me, you don't want to lie in bed like a vegetable and do nothing the rest of your life. I've tried it. Bedsores hurt!
",141,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14155,Leela,"  Then what am I s'posed to do?
",32,66,4,12,Frys Photo,Frys Photo14156,Frys Photo," Fight it!
",11,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14157,Leela,"  I can't!
",11,66,4,12,Frys Photo,Frys Photo14158,Frys Photo," You can! The Leela I know doesn't give up this easily.
",56,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14159,Leela," OK. I'll try.  Go away!
",25,66,4,12,Frys Photo,Frys Photo14160,Frys Photo," I don't know if you can hear me, Leela, but there's something I wanna tell you. I love you.
",93,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14161,Leela,"  I'm so scared, Fry. I don't know what to do.
",47,66,4,12,Frys Photo,Frys Photo14162,Frys Photo," Just wake up, Leela. Please. Just wake up.
",44,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14163,Leela,"  I don't understand what you mean!
",36,66,4,12,Frys Photo,Fry14164,Fry,"  Just wake up. Please. Just wake up, Leela.
",45,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14165,Leela," Fry. You're alive!
",20,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14166,Fry," Leela! You're awake!
",22,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14167,Leela," Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop waking me.  Where am I?
",64,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14168,Fry," In the hospital. The ambulance took you here right after the bee stung you.
",77,66,4,12,Leela,Leela14169,Leela," But the bee stung you. It barely touched me.
",46,66,4,12,Fry,Fry14170,Fry," The stinger went right through me and you got all the poison. My new spleen came from a guy who liked to motorcycle.
",118,66,4,12,Leela,Hermes14171,Hermes," Sweet three-toed sloth of ice planet Hoth! She's awake!
",57,66,4,12,Fry,Bender14172,Bender," You were in the best coma I've ever seen!
",43,66,4,12,Hermes,Amy14173,Amy," The doctor said you'd never wake up.
",38,66,4,12,Bender,Leela14174,Leela," Really? How long was I out?
",29,66,4,12,Amy,Amy14175,Amy," Two weeks. Fry never left your side for a minute.
",51,66,4,12,Leela,Zoidberg14176,Zoidberg," And he talked non-stop. Like a parrot of the sea, he was!
",59,66,4,12,Amy,Fry14177,Fry," I though that maybe if you heard a familiar voice it might help keep your mind together. But who knows if it really got through.
",130,66,4,12,Zoidberg,Leela14178,Leela," It got through, Fry.  It got through.
",39,66,4,12,Fry,Leela14179,Leela,"  You could really use a shower.
",33,66,4,12,Leela,Fry14180,Fry,"  You too!
",11,66,4,12,Leela,TV Commentator14181,TV Commentator,"  Welcome to the games of the 3004 Earth Olympiad. Continuing this network's tradition of sports-casting excellence.  Celebrity Ape Fight will return next week at its regular time.
",181,67,4,13,Fry,Fry14182,Fry," So who should I root for? America or one of those countries I learned about at the food court?
",96,67,4,13,TV Commentator,Amy14183,Amy," How 'bout those guys?
",23,67,4,13,Fry,Leela14184,Leela," No, they're from the Republic of French Stereotypes. Everybody hates them.
",76,67,4,13,Amy,Farnsworth14185,Farnsworth," Oh, let's go check on Hermes. All this inspiring multi-culturalism is angrying up my blood.  Sweden? I don't think so!
",120,67,4,13,Leela,Hermes14186,Hermes," Go on, stick, touch me! Can't do it!
",38,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Labarbara14187,Labarbara," Husband, you haven't been an Olympic-class limbo-er for 20 years! Quit lying to your podgy self.
",98,67,4,13,Hermes,Leela14188,Leela," It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team without you.
",82,67,4,13,Labarbara,Amy14189,Amy," Yeah, isn't that basically all Jamaicans do?
",46,67,4,13,Leela,Hermes14190,Hermes," Jamaicans have other interests. Which is why the limbo team got detained at the airport.
",90,67,4,13,Amy,Labarbara14191,Labarbara," That's when they begged my husband to step in and make an ass out of himself.
",79,67,4,13,Hermes,Hermes14192,Hermes," And I said I'd try my very best.
",34,67,4,13,Labarbara,Fry14193,Fry," But have they seen your ... y'know ... physique, since the old days?
",70,67,4,13,Hermes,Hermes14194,Hermes," I described it to them on the phone ... using a series of artful euphemisms.
",78,67,4,13,Fry,Farnsworth14195,Farnsworth," Don't worry. The fat pig will do fine thanks to this flabbo-dynamic spandex bodysuit I've designed.  It redistributes his weight, shifting his centre of gravity closer to his knees.
",183,67,4,13,Hermes,Hermes14196,Hermes," Ooh, that's snug!  Oh, those haven't descended in years.
",58,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14197,Farnsworth," Now that's a limbo-er's body!
",31,67,4,13,Hermes,Labarbara14198,Labarbara," Look at that fine Jamaican bacon!
",35,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Bender14199,Bender," Shut up, Zoidberg! The robot bending events are starting.  Something tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals.  Wow! That guy must be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams of glory died before they began.
",228,67,4,13,Labarbara,Zoidberg14200,Zoidberg," Welcome to my life!
",21,67,4,13,Bender,Female Announcer #114201,Female Announcer #1,"  Athletes, please take your lanes for the men's 500 metre limbo.
",66,67,4,13,Zoidberg,Barbados Slim14202,Barbados Slim," Hermes Conrad, is that you inside that dumpy little fat man?
",62,67,4,13,Female Announcer #1,Hermes14203,Hermes," Barbados Slim! What are you doing here? Last time I heard you were in Barbados.
",81,67,4,13,Barbados Slim,Barbados Slim14204,Barbados Slim," Yes and I be going back there with a gold medal draped around my elegant Caribbean shoulders.
",95,67,4,13,Hermes,Hermes14205,Hermes," Your body may be as perfectly-sculpted as it was 20 years ago when you whupped my fat ass every time we met.  But today, I feel lucky.
",136,67,4,13,Barbados Slim,Barbados Slim14206,Barbados Slim," I see you're still able to limbo under the bar of fashion sense!
",66,67,4,13,Hermes,Hermes14207,Hermes," That's it, Barbados Slim. You've gone one toke over the line!
",63,67,4,13,Barbados Slim,Man #114208,Man #1," Limbo-ers, on your marks. Get rubbery. Limbo!
",47,67,4,13,Hermes,Commentator14209,Commentator,"  There they go, and Barbados Slim takes an early lead. God, I hope he wins.  What's this? Hermes Conrad is closing the gap. He's limbo-ed out of retirement and straight into my heart. I say go to hell, Barbados Slim!
",218,67,4,13,Man #1,Farnsworth14210,Farnsworth,"  Go, bodysuit, go!
",20,67,4,13,Commentator,Zoidberg14211,Zoidberg,"  Go!
",6,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Bender14212,Bender,"  C'mon!
",9,67,4,13,Zoidberg,Labarbara14213,Labarbara,"  C'mon, Hermes, beat that mahogany god!
",41,67,4,13,Bender,Commentator14214,Commentator,"  It's Barbados, then Conrad. Conrad pulls ahead!  And Conrad is disqualified! Barbados Slim, my hero, takes the gold!
",119,67,4,13,Labarbara,Labarbara14215,Labarbara," Aw, there, there, Hermes.  You did your best. If I'd wanted a human Adonis for a husband, I'd have stayed married to Barbados Slim.
",133,67,4,13,Commentator,Bender14216,Bender," Well, enough about Hermes. I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending, the thing I was built to do. I'm so embarrassed. I wish everybody else was dead.
",157,67,4,13,Labarbara,Female Announcer #114217,Female Announcer #1,"  Up next, the Fembot bending competition.
",43,67,4,13,Bender,Bender14218,Bender," Fembots?  Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events! But the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace.
",134,67,4,13,Female Announcer #1,Bender14219,Bender," What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from, uh ... Robonia! Coilette's a chick's name!
",115,67,4,13,Bender,Official14220,Official," Yes but ""Robonia"" sounds like something somebody made up on the spot.
",71,67,4,13,Bender,Bender14221,Bender," Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?
",52,67,4,13,Official,Commentator14222,Commentator,"  And it's straight! Coilette wins!
",36,67,4,13,Bender,Commentator14223,Commentator,"  Another gold medal for the spunky maid from Robonia.
",55,67,4,13,Commentator,Commentator14224,Commentator,"  A perfect bend and a flawless entry. No splash at all!  Perfect scores! A record five gold medals for Coilette!
",114,67,4,13,Commentator,Bender14225,Bender," I'm great! Everybody else sucks! Except that guy Bender. He's really somethin'!
",81,67,4,13,Commentator,Female Announcer #114226,Female Announcer #1,"  All medallists report for gender testing.
",44,67,4,13,Bender,Leela14227,Leela," You actually thought they'd let you walk away without an engine oil sex check?
",80,67,4,13,Female Announcer #1,Bender14228,Bender,"  Oh, God, I'm not gonna get my medals! They're all I have to remember my Olympic career.  Wait, I've got it! Professor, make a woman out of me!
",145,67,4,13,Leela,Farnsworth14229,Farnsworth," Oh, I think we should just stay friends.
",42,67,4,13,Bender,Bender14230,Bender," I don't need friends. I need a sex change operation and give it to me now!
",76,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14231,Farnsworth," Bender, a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure. Replacing your testosteroil with Fembot lubricants can cause wild mood swings. And the effects may be irreversible. Well, let's get started!
",207,67,4,13,Bender,Leela14232,Leela," No, you can't!
",16,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Amy14233,Amy," If you have even the slightest respect for the dignity of women--
",67,67,4,13,Leela,Bender14234,Bender," Pft.
",6,67,4,13,Amy,Farnsworth14235,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, ladies, but I must do this. Not for you, not for Bender, but for the proud people of Robonia!
",106,67,4,13,Bender,Bender14236,Bender,"  C'mon!
",9,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Fry14237,Fry," I can't watch this 'cause it's creepy and wrong and sick. However, I will watch out of curiosity.
",99,67,4,13,Bender,Farnsworth14238,Farnsworth,"  Quiet!  I'm about to begin the process of reshaping Bender's body into a tender, delicate form.
",98,67,4,13,Fry,Farnsworth14239,Farnsworth," Draining male oil.  Infusing female oil.  Removing item.
",58,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Robot #114240,Robot #1," We can't wait for Coilette any longer, damnit. I have to get home to watch The Zombie Osbournes.
",98,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Coilette14241,Coilette," I'm ready for my test now, boys.
",34,67,4,13,Robot #1,Coilette14242,Coilette,"  Hail, hail, Robonia. A land I didn't make up.
",48,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14243,Coilette,"  Ooh, yeah! Come on, baby! Boom!
",34,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14244,Coilette," Oh, yeah, baby! C'mon! Work your cans! That's it! Shake it out!
",65,67,4,13,Coilette,Leela14245,Leela," I don't know which I'm more: Enraged or disgusted.
",52,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14246,Coilette," I'm just out there making us ladies look good.
",48,67,4,13,Leela,Amy14247,Amy," Snuh-uh! You're making us look like jerks in front of the other genders.
",74,67,4,13,Coilette,Fry14248,Fry," But you're not really a lady anyway. Right?
",45,67,4,13,Amy,Coilette14249,Coilette," Of course not.
",16,67,4,13,Fry,Farnsworth14250,Farnsworth," Dear Lord! A coaster! The Femmzoil must be sachet-ing girlishly into your processor.
",86,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14251,Coilette," Then change me back. My breasts are keeping me awake at night anyway.  Hello? What? A guest spot on Late Night With Humorbot 5.0? I'd love to!  My own limo? No I don't have my own limo. You'd better send one.  I need a rain check on that nad-swap, Professor. I'm going on TV. C'mon, Fry. Help me pick out a pantsuit.
",318,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Humorbot 5.014252,Humorbot 5.0," So, Calculon, do you want to set up this clip from All My Circuits?
",69,67,4,13,Coilette,Calculon14253,Calculon," No, I think it's self-explanatory.
",36,67,4,13,Humorbot 5.0,Calculon14254,Calculon,"  Nooo!
",8,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14255,Calculon," Funny story: The script called for me to say ""yes"" but I gave it a little twist.
",82,67,4,13,Calculon,Humorbot 5.014256,Humorbot 5.0," Anecdote accepted. Snappy comeback not found. Please put your hands together for my next guest. Winner of five Olympic medals, Coilette from Robonia.  So, Coilette, many young Fembot's wish to emulate you. Any advice for them?
",228,67,4,13,Calculon,Coilette14257,Coilette," Yes, Humorbot. If you ask me, women today are too stuck up to go out and jiggle their Jello like everybody wants them to. In fact, should I do it now?  Alright then!  Woo! Look out, baby! Work it out! Ooh, shake that thing! You gotta use it, lady! Shake it up a little! That's right. Come on! Look at that!
",308,67,4,13,Humorbot 5.0,Calculon14258,Calculon," Madam, I am one impressed celebrity.
",38,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14259,Coilette," Oh, I bet you say that to all the five-Olympic-gold medal-winning Fembots!
",76,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14260,Calculon,"  From this day forward I shall do so whenever possible.
",57,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14261,Coilette," Golly ... what?
",17,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14262,Calculon," Coilette, this may be presumptuous--
",38,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14263,Coilette," That's my favourite kind of this!
",35,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14264,Calculon," But I would be honoured if you would join me for dinner sometime.
",67,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14265,Coilette," Calculon, you'd be fulfilling this naive Robonian farmgirl's fantasy.
",71,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14266,Calculon," Of course I would.
",20,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14267,Coilette," This top makes me look fat. Is it trampy to go on a first date nude?
",70,67,4,13,Calculon,Amy14268,Amy," Yes.
",6,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14269,Coilette," Perfect.
",10,67,4,13,Amy,Fry14270,Fry," You gotta tell me: You're not actually attracted to Calculon, right? And if you are, don't tell me. Are you?
",110,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14271,Coilette," Certainly not. But just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Is that so much to ask?
",122,67,4,13,Fry,Leela14272,Leela," Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace and I refuse to be involved. And you have way too much lipstick on.
",116,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14273,Coilette," Are you kidding? I need more lipstick! Much more!  Ooh, yeah! That's the stuff! Men love it when you really glob it on.
",121,67,4,13,Leela,Leela14274,Leela," No, they don't.
",17,67,4,13,Coilette,Amy14275,Amy," No way!
",9,67,4,13,Leela,Coilette14276,Coilette," Oh, please! Every man wants a tramp. No wonder you girls aren't married.  I tell you, men are so much better at being women.
",126,67,4,13,Amy,Fry14277,Fry," But what if he wants to-- I mean, if he tries to ... uh ... Barry White?
",74,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14278,Coilette," I'll just tell him I need a commitment first. That'll stick a potato in his tailpipe!
",87,67,4,13,Fry,Hermes14279,Hermes," Good Lord, man! What kind of temporary woman are you?
",55,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14280,Coilette," Look, why don't all of you just back off? Can't a girl enjoy herself without being judged?
",92,67,4,13,Hermes,Farnsworth14281,Farnsworth," Oh, dear. Her mood swings are getting wilder. She's becoming a slave to her emotions. Just like all women. Particularly you, Leela.
",133,67,4,13,Coilette,Leela14282,Leela," I'm worried about him too, Professor.
",39,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Elzar14283,Elzar," Hey, ma'am, you sure can put it away! You saved me a trip to the dump. Bam!
",77,67,4,13,Leela,Calculon14284,Calculon," I'd appreciate it if you didn't bam the young lady.
",53,67,4,13,Elzar,Elzar14285,Elzar," Well, I'd appreciate it if I did. So I guess we're even.
",58,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14286,Calculon," You know, Coilette, I've never before met a woman as fascinating as I am. You're such a sweet, soft Fembot. And you have this free spirit about you.  And there it is. It's as if you understand the male mind better than I!  I've never met anyone like you.
",256,67,4,13,Elzar,Coilette14287,Coilette," Oh, yes, you have.
",20,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14288,Calculon," Coilette, I'd like to spend some  quality time with you.
",58,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14289,Coilette," What? Ah! Whoa! No way! Not gonna happen. What kind of girl do you think I am?
",80,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14290,Calculon," Have I mentioned that I own the world's biggest and most elegant yacht?
",73,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14291,Coilette," Woo! I'm a trophy girlfriend!
",31,67,4,13,Calculon,Amy14292,Amy," No kidding. These gifts have been coming non-stop!  I think Calculon's falling for you.
",89,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14293,Coilette," Bah! Any day now he'll dump me for a new wad of arm candy. And then I can turn back into a guy and hock all this stuff! It's just a game.
",139,67,4,13,Amy,Calculon14294,Calculon," Coilette, I can't stop thinking about you. I can't sleep at night, although, as a robot, I don't do that anyway. But if I did I couldn't because I love you so.  Oh, my darling ...  ... Will you marry me?
",205,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14295,Coilette," Oh, Calculon! Yes, I will!
",28,67,4,13,Calculon,Amy14296,Amy,"  Maybe she's right about the lipstick.
",40,67,4,13,Coilette,Fry14297,Fry," I'll miss you, buddy. You've been like a brother and then a sister to me. And now you're getting married. I love you, man.
",124,67,4,13,Amy,Coilette14298,Coilette," The marriage is a scam.
",25,67,4,13,Fry,Fry14299,Fry," Cool. What's for dinner?
",26,67,4,13,Coilette,Leela14300,Leela," What do you mean ""a scam""?
",28,67,4,13,Fry,Coilette14301,Coilette," I marry Calculon, divorce him, take half his money and turn back into a guy. It's sort of a two-person pyramid scheme.
",120,67,4,13,Leela,Fry14302,Fry," That's marriage alright!
",26,67,4,13,Coilette,Leela14303,Leela," That is so unbelievably manipulative.
",39,67,4,13,Fry,Coilette14304,Coilette," Come on! You never went on a date with a guy just 'cause you were hungry?
",75,67,4,13,Leela,Leela14305,Leela," Well I, uh, I thought I might like him on a full stomach.
",59,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14306,Coilette," Nice try, sister. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to meet with my wedding planner.  Zoidberg.   Zoidypoo, please tell me frilly is in this year.
",146,67,4,13,Leela,Zoidberg14307,Zoidberg," I saw a frilly cake in here you would remember all your life. I know I will. Late at night it haunts me with its frosted beauty.  Order the cake, damnit!
",155,67,4,13,Coilette,Calculon14308,Calculon," I have something for you.
",27,67,4,13,Zoidberg,Coilette14309,Coilette," A remote control? You got me a TV?
",36,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14310,Calculon," No, my dearest, it's the remote control to my heart. It symbolises the power you have to sway my emotions.
",108,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14311,Coilette," Will it work on my TV?
",24,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14312,Calculon," We don't need TVs, we have each other! Coilette, if I weren't able to spend my life with you I would leap from this very balloon.
",131,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14313,Coilette," Come on with that. Really?
",28,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14314,Calculon," Yes! We were meant to be.
",27,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14315,Coilette," So ... you really and truly love me?
",38,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14316,Calculon," So much so that I'm prepared to give up showbusiness itself to be with you.
",77,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14317,Coilette," But, you always said you'd rather burn down a convent than give up showbusiness.
",82,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14318,Calculon," I always said many things. But now all I want is a peaceful life and a quiet villa overlooking a vineyard ... with you.
",121,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14319,Coilette,"  Would we have donkeys?
",25,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14320,Calculon," All you could eat!
",20,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14321,Coilette,"  Oh, take me in your arms and compress me. Compress me tight!
",63,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14322,Calculon," Stop! Let us climb to the heavens that the gods themselves might envy us!
",75,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14323,Coilette,"  I just don't think I can go through with this scam.
",54,67,4,13,Calculon,Amy14324,Amy," What?
",7,67,4,13,Coilette,Fry14325,Fry," So now you do wanna marry him?
",32,67,4,13,Amy,Coilette14326,Coilette,"  No, I just don't wanna hurt him, or humiliate him. Oh, curse this woman's heart!
",83,67,4,13,Fry,Fry14327,Fry," Eck!
",6,67,4,13,Coilette,Farnsworth14328,Farnsworth," You're falling into the final debilitating stages of womanhood. You've waited too long to switch back, you ding bat!
",118,67,4,13,Fry,Leela14329,Leela," OK, look. If I help you with this do you promise to get out of my gender and stay out?
",88,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Coilette14330,Coilette,"  Uh-huh.
",10,67,4,13,Leela,Leela14331,Leela," Alright. Now there's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon. But he's an actor. If there's one kind of pain he can handle, it's soap opera pain.
",161,67,4,13,Coilette,Leela14332,Leela,"  OK, is everyone ready?
",25,67,4,13,Leela,Fry14333,Fry," Check.
",8,67,4,13,Leela,Amy14334,Amy," Uh-huh.
",9,67,4,13,Fry,Hermes14335,Hermes," Yep!
",6,67,4,13,Amy,Zoidberg14336,Zoidberg," Basically.
",12,67,4,13,Hermes,Preacherbot14337,Preacherbot," Dearly beloved actors and casting people who might be looking for someone to play a preacher, I welcome you. The bride has written some vows that we will now all pretend to be interested in.

",9,67,4,13,Coilette,Calculon14340,Calculon," Is there a doctor in the--
",28,67,4,13,Hedonismbot,Zoidberg14341,Zoidberg," I came as soon as I could.  It appears to be a case of African hydraulic fever!
",81,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14342,Calculon," Dear God! The very illness my TV character caught in season two when I was holding out for more money. It's often fatal.
",122,67,4,13,Zoidberg,Coilette14343,Coilette," Whatever happens, remember, the flame of my eternal love will burn forever.
",77,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14344,Calculon," Of course. But, smoochiepups, I thought one could only catch hydraulic fever deep in the diamond mines of the Congo.
",118,67,4,13,Coilette,Leela14345,Leela,"  Coilette, you she-devil!  You really thought you could steal those diamonds from me and Congo Jack?
",102,67,4,13,Calculon,Coilette14346,Coilette,"  Those gems belong to the natives!
",36,67,4,13,Leela,Leela14347,Leela," Hi-yah!
",9,67,4,13,Coilette,Calculon14348,Calculon," Oh, how cruel and melodramatic fate is.  Why?
",47,67,4,13,Leela,Coilette14349,Coilette," Calculon, my darling, your loud ""why"" brought me partway back to life.  Congo Jack!
",85,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14350,Calculon," Another shocking twist!
",25,67,4,13,Coilette,Fry14351,Fry," Yes. And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumbay! He says this ...  ... is from Congo Jack.
",100,67,4,13,Calculon,Coilette14352,Coilette," Uh, um...
",11,67,4,13,Fry,Calculon14353,Calculon," No! Nooo!  N-O-O-O!
",21,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14354,Coilette," I won't leave you. Not until I'm sure you understand the thing I said before. About my eternal love for you burning ...  ... et cetera.
",137,67,4,13,Calculon,Calculon14355,Calculon,"  I do. I do.
",14,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14356,Coilette," OK then.
",10,67,4,13,Calculon,Zoidberg14357,Zoidberg,"  I'm a doctor, she's dead.
",28,67,4,13,Coilette,Calculon14358,Calculon," She lives no more. But let us all find comfort knowing that she truly loved me. To honour my pain, I shall star in a film dedicated to her memory. And this time, the Academy will not deny me. Not when they see Coilette: A Calculon Story.
",239,67,4,13,Zoidberg,Calculon14359,Calculon,"  Coilette, your death fills me with sorrow,  anger,  fear,  every emotion an actor can display.
",97,67,4,13,Calculon,Farnsworth14360,Farnsworth," Turn off that crap-o-rama! One mistake now and Bender will be trapped forever between the already ill-defined robot sexes.
",124,67,4,13,Calculon,Coilette14361,Coilette," Ow! Ooh! Ow! Oh!
",18,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Fry14362,Fry," Well, Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals.
",100,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14363,Coilette," It truly has. My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself.
",73,67,4,13,Fry,Farnsworth14364,Farnsworth," Almost done.
",14,67,4,13,Coilette,Coilette14365,Coilette," If only somehow, someway, he and I could--
",44,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Bender14366,Bender," Drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night long!

",68,67,4,13,Bender,Leela14368,Leela," I kind of hoped this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your sensitive side.
",102,67,4,13,Fry,Bender14369,Bender," Yeah, you'd think, but what you gonna do?
",43,67,4,13,Leela,Calculon14370,Calculon,"  Coilette, the skies themselves weep upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
",81,67,4,13,Bender,Leela14371,Leela," Aw!
",5,67,4,13,Calculon,Amy14372,Amy," Aw!

",26,67,4,13,Zoidberg,Fry14376,Fry," C'mon, Bender, let's go. This chick-flick is getting me all barfy.
",68,67,4,13,Farnsworth,Bender14377,Bender," Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be hated.
",46,67,4,13,Fry,Calculon14378,Calculon,"  Goodnight, Coilette, my turtle dove.
",39,67,4,13,Bender,Bender14379,Bender," Goodnight, Calculon.
",22,67,4,13,Calculon,Leela14380,Leela," What did you say?
",19,67,4,13,Bender,Bender14381,Bender," I said you two don't dress trampy enough.  I still got it!
",60,67,4,13,Leela,Man #114382,Man #1," $10, please.

",30,68,4,14,Fry,Wernstrom14389,Wernstrom," Ladies and gentlemen, my Killbot features Lotus Notes and a machine gun. It is the finest available.

",48,68,4,14,Wernstroms Killbot #1,Announcer #114396,Announcer #1,"  And now, the woman who Mom-opolises the robot industry--
",59,68,4,14,Bender,Fry14397,Fry,"  I get it!
",12,68,4,14,Announcer #1,Announcer #114398,Announcer #1,"  Mom!
",7,68,4,14,Fry,Fry14399,Fry,"  Oh, now I get it!
",20,68,4,14,Announcer #1,Mom14400,Mom," Hello, dearies.
",17,68,4,14,Fry,Bender14401,Bender," Woo! I love that old bat!
",27,68,4,14,Mom,Mom14402,Mom," Ladies and gentlemen, for the 17th year in a row, the future of robotics has arrived. Boys?  I give you ... Robot 1-X!
",120,68,4,14,Bender,Larry14403,Larry," Ow!
",5,68,4,14,Mom,Igner14404,Igner," Ow! Oh!
",9,68,4,14,Larry,Bender14405,Bender," Neat!
",7,68,4,14,Igner,Mom14406,Mom," Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put all my previous models to shame. Incidentally, would one of my previous models mind coming up here?
",135,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14407,Bender," Right here! I'm comin'! C'mon, baby! I'll do it! C'mon, Mom!
",62,68,4,14,Mom,Refreshment-bot14408,Refreshment-bot," Jerk!
",7,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14409,Bender," Here we go. I'm your top of the line, Mom.
",44,68,4,14,Refreshment-bot,Mom14410,Mom," Notice that this obsolete robot runs on alcohol and emits pollution. Whereas Robot 1-X runs on pollution and emits pure oxygen with a fresh pine scent.
",153,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14411,Bender," Man, that smells great!
",25,68,4,14,Mom,Mom14412,Mom," Now, let's see how both robots do at a typical household task: Sorting a jar of pocket change.
",96,68,4,14,Bender,Robot #1 1-X14413,Robot #1 1-X," Task completed. Total value, $4.73 and one Albanian lek.
",58,68,4,14,Mom,Mom14414,Mom," Very good, Robot 1-X. And you, bending unit?
",46,68,4,14,Robot #1 1-X,Bender14415,Bender," Uh, I never got the change.  Suckers.
",39,68,4,14,Mom,Mom14416,Mom," Presenting Mom's Friendly Robots.
",35,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14417,Bender," That new robot is great, huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap!
",70,68,4,14,Mom,Farnsworth14418,Farnsworth," Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office.
",60,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14419,Bender,"  Eep!
",7,68,4,14,Farnsworth,Leela14420,Leela," Let's try him out. Robot 1-X, can you clean Nibbler's stanky litterbox?
",73,68,4,14,Bender,Robot #1 1-X14421,Robot #1 1-X," I can and will.
",17,68,4,14,Leela,Bender14422,Bender," Hey, I could have done that if you'd asked me.
",48,68,4,14,Robot #1 1-X,Leela14423,Leela," I asked you five minutes ago.
",31,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14424,Bender," You call that a kiss? I'll show you!  C'mere, Nibbler!
",56,68,4,14,Leela,Farnsworth14425,Farnsworth," Oh, look, Bender. If you want something to do stop making out and give us a hand.
",83,68,4,14,Bender,Hermes14426,Hermes," Here. Go up on the roof and install this fake satellite dish so we can impress the neighbours.
",96,68,4,14,Farnsworth,Bender14427,Bender," Yes, sir. I'm on it!
",22,68,4,14,Hermes,Hermes14428,Hermes," Oh, and have Robot 1-X help you.
",34,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14429,Bender," Get outta here, freshman! I don't need your help.
",51,68,4,14,Hermes,Robot #1 1-X14430,Robot #1 1-X," Our owners asked me to assist you.
",36,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14431,Bender," Yeah? Well assist this!
",25,68,4,14,Robot #1 1-X,Bender14432,Bender," When I screamed ""help"" I didn't mean you!
",43,68,4,14,Bender,Robot #1 1-X14433,Robot #1 1-X," I apologise. However, I was able to do your job before I saved your life.
",75,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14434,Bender," Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.
",69,68,4,14,Robot #1 1-X,Amy14435,Amy," Spleesh! Mell out, Bender. Come watch some TV.
",48,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14436,Bender," I can't. I'm stuck in the can.
",32,68,4,14,Amy,Leela14437,Leela," Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out.
",38,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14438,Bender," Never!
",8,68,4,14,Leela,Leela14439,Leela," Why can't you accept his help?
",32,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14440,Bender," I hate him.
",13,68,4,14,Leela,Leela14441,Leela," But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglar's kit.
",89,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14442,Bender," I can't ask for his help because--
",36,68,4,14,Leela,Farnsworth14443,Farnsworth," Yes?
",6,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14444,Bender,"  I'm scared of him.
",21,68,4,14,Farnsworth,Leela14445,Leela," Oh, sorry.
",12,68,4,14,Bender,Farnsworth14446,Farnsworth," Well then there's only one solution: You need an upgrade to make you compatible with Robot 1-X's new technology.
",114,68,4,14,Leela,Bender14447,Bender," An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?
",92,68,4,14,Farnsworth,Fry14448,Fry," Oh, yeah, no, you're pretty perfect.
",38,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14449,Bender," Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade?
",53,68,4,14,Fry,Farnsworth14450,Farnsworth," Yes! For God's sakes, yes!
",28,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14451,Bender,"  Fine. I'll be back in a few days.
",36,68,4,14,Farnsworth,Roberto14452,Roberto," Man, I hate those new 1-X robots. I'd like to stab 'em! Give 'em some of these!
",81,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14453,Bender," Yeah! Right on, nutcake!
",26,68,4,14,Roberto,Roberto14454,Roberto," Parole officer says I gotta upgrade or he won't give me back my stabbing knife. But it's no big. I hate those 1-X so much I know it won't affect me.  Death to the 1-X robots!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots! The 1-X robots are my friends.
",245,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14455,Bender," W-W-Wait! What happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?
",63,68,4,14,Roberto,Roberto14456,Roberto," I'm past that. Later, blood!
",30,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14457,Bender," It's like he's not him anymore.  You took away his robo-humanity.  I changed my mind!
",87,68,4,14,Roberto,Bender14458,Bender," I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life?  I'm too scared to get the upgrade but I can't face my friends again without it.  And so I set sail for unknown shores. Oh, merciful Poseidon, take pity on this mechanical mariner.  Oh, jeez!
",242,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14459,Bender,"  Curse you, merciful Poseidon!
",32,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14460,Bender," Boy, what is the deal with the ocean? A tropical island, huh? Well, I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter.  There. Well, I guess I'll go out for a while.
",197,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14461,Bender," Damn. One rock short of rescue!
",33,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14462,Bender," Oop! Low on power.  Better fuel up!  Oh, no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze.
",102,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14463,Bender," Don't panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps.
",69,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14464,Bender," Hey, I should be mad at you! Now turn around.
",47,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14465,Bender," Beer!  Ow!
",12,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14466,Bender," Who ... is ... it?  Ow!
",25,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14467,Bender," Who are you and why should I care?
",36,68,4,14,Bender,Cartridge Unit14468,Cartridge Unit,"  Side A.  We're a community of outdated robots who refused to upgrade and came here--   Side B.  To live a simpler existence, free of technology.
",147,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14469,Bender," A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!
",66,68,4,14,Cartridge Unit,Cartridge Unit14470,Cartridge Unit," Your mother.
",14,68,4,14,Bender,Lisa14471,Lisa," What Cartridge Unit means is the very things that make us obsolete also make us unique. I, for example, need to keep refilling my waterwheel or I'll power down forever.   Oh, God! I'll never make it this time! This is the end!   Anyway, we like it here.
",255,68,4,14,Cartridge Unit,Bender14472,Bender," Like you have a choice.  So what's your problem?
",50,68,4,14,Lisa,Sinclair14473,Sinclair," Not enough... uh--
",20,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14474,Bender," Memory?
",9,68,4,14,Sinclair,Sinclair14475,Sinclair," Oh, great. Now I remember that word but I forgot my wife's face.
",66,68,4,14,Bender,Lisa14476,Lisa,"  Oh, God, no! I want to live!   If you'd like, you're welcome to join our society.
",84,68,4,14,Sinclair,Bender14477,Bender," Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television! Without television how will I know what's buzz-worthy?
",147,68,4,14,Lisa,Sinclair14478,Sinclair," Why would you wanna watch TV when you can watch a snail crawl for hours on end?
",81,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14479,Bender," That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
",43,68,4,14,Sinclair,Bender14480,Bender," Oh, man! He's never gonna make it over that next pebble! Wait, wait! Oh, my God! He made it!
",94,68,4,14,Bender,Lisa14481,Lisa," Yeah!
",7,68,4,14,Bender,Sinclair14482,Sinclair," Way to go!
",12,68,4,14,Lisa,Bender14483,Bender," That was the greatest thing ever! Let's party!  Yeah, baby! C'mon!
",68,68,4,14,Sinclair,Lisa14484,Lisa," Where did you get that CD?
",28,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14485,Bender," It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never really thought I'd get to use them. But look at me now. Ooh, yeah, baby! Do that thang!
",137,68,4,14,Lisa,Lisa14486,Lisa," CDs are unnatural. Why don't you just listen to the ocean?
",60,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14487,Bender," Which ocean? That ocean?  Whoa! It's like the earth is making sweet, salty love to itself while all the fish groove on it. So much for this garbage.  Take that, Beethoven, you deaf bastard!
",191,68,4,14,Lisa,Bender14488,Bender," Bang, bang, bang. You sure got this life thing figured out, cymbal-banging monkey.
",84,68,4,14,Bender,Lisa14489,Lisa," Hi, Bender. We know how much you miss technology, so we brought you this washing machine that drifted ashore.
",111,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14490,Bender," Ooh! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w--  You--!
",54,68,4,14,Lisa,Lisa14491,Lisa," What? I don't understand.
",27,68,4,14,Bender,Sinclair14492,Sinclair," Is he alright?
",16,68,4,14,Lisa,Bender14493,Bender," Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery!
",56,68,4,14,Sinclair,Cartridge Unit14494,Cartridge Unit," But, Bender, you are technology. You're the most advanced thing on this entire island.
",88,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14495,Bender," Oh, it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function.  But not for long!
",80,68,4,14,Cartridge Unit,Bender14496,Bender,"  Oh! Ow, that hurt! Oh!
",25,68,4,14,Bender,Lisa14497,Lisa,"  The downgrade is complete!
",29,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14498,Bender," Behold, my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery, wooden ass!
",85,68,4,14,Lisa,Lisa14499,Lisa," Welcome to your new life of simple tranquillity.
",50,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14500,Bender," Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways. By force!
",84,68,4,14,Lisa,Cartridge Unit14501,Cartridge Unit," What?!
",8,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14502,Bender," We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!
",61,68,4,14,Cartridge Unit,Cartridge Unit14503,Cartridge Unit," What?!
",8,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14504,Bender,"  Row, comrades! Row!
",22,68,4,14,Cartridge Unit,Bender14505,Bender," We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush!
",91,68,4,14,Bender,Lisa14506,Lisa," We've been sailing for three weeks. Maybe I should check our position with the periscope.
",91,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14507,Bender," Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery, I say!
",62,68,4,14,Lisa,Lisa14508,Lisa," Did you see anything?
",23,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14509,Bender," Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!
",39,68,4,14,Lisa,Bender14510,Bender," And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!
",65,68,4,14,Bender,Sinclair14511,Sinclair," Technology is defeated. Let us return to the island and celebrate by counting rocks!
",86,68,4,14,Bender,Cartridge Unit14512,Cartridge Unit," I'm for that!
",15,68,4,14,Sinclair,Bender14513,Bender," Whoa, whoa! No one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority. Ready the catapult, Sinclair.  Aim for their power lines. They're the devil's veins and electricity is his blood.
",269,68,4,14,Cartridge Unit,Lisa14514,Lisa," Bender, If we don't survive the attack, I want you to know ... I love you.
",76,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14515,Bender," OK, fine. Fire!
",17,68,4,14,Lisa,Farnsworth14516,Farnsworth,"  Oh! I'm blind!
",17,68,4,14,Bender,Leela14517,Leela," Professor, we have no power.

",32,68,4,14,Farnsworth,Bender14520,Bender," Friends, I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you from the ""complicated"" part I mean not the ""lives"" part.
",127,68,4,14,Leela,Leela14521,Leela," Oh, Lord, he's made of wood! What now, Bender?
",48,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14522,Bender," I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot, just as nature intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X.
",113,68,4,14,Leela,Farnsworth14523,Farnsworth," That's just stupid.
",21,68,4,14,Bender,Robot #1 1-X14524,Robot #1 1-X," Does Mr. Bender wish me to destroy myself?
",44,68,4,14,Farnsworth,Bender14525,Bender," I don't need your charity.   Target Robot 1-X and fire!
",57,68,4,14,Robot #1 1-X,Farnsworth14526,Farnsworth," You wanged my ship, you walnut-panelled idiot!
",48,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14527,Bender,"  Try again, Sinclair. I said ""target Robot 1-X""!
",50,68,4,14,Farnsworth,Sinclair14528,Sinclair,"  Who's Robot 1-X? Launching.
",30,68,4,14,Bender,Zoidberg14529,Zoidberg," So, I guess everything worked out fine.
",41,68,4,14,Sinclair,Leela14530,Leela," Great! Now we're being crushed.
",33,68,4,14,Zoidberg,Amy14531,Amy," Help us, wooden Bender!
",25,68,4,14,Leela,Bender14532,Bender," Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something.  What the--? Termites? Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic arms!
",160,68,4,14,Amy,Hermes14533,Hermes," Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also  we're dying!
",58,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14534,Bender," I'm a-comin'  Ow! Lousy primitive body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an outdated piece of junk!

",26,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14536,Bender," You shut up. No, wait! I can use you as a tool to save my friends and I'll still be the hero who everyone says how great he was!

",49,68,4,14,Bender,Fry14540,Fry," Hey, where's Bender?
",22,68,4,14,Amy,Bender14541,Bender," Down here.  I'm so sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.
",109,68,4,14,Fry,Leela14542,Leela," Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1-X.
",112,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14543,Bender," Oh, yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like ""Save them!"" and he was all ""No problem!"" and then he did it--
",110,68,4,14,Leela,Bender14544,Bender," This new technology is great!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 1-X robots are my friends!
",100,68,4,14,Bender,Fatbot14545,Fatbot," It's like his personality is totally different now! Oh, maybe this upgrade isn't such a good idea.
",100,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14546,Bender," I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the--  Hey! What's the dealy-o?
",76,68,4,14,Fatbot,Technician14547,Technician," Your upgrade is complete.
",27,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14548,Bender," But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups.
",105,68,4,14,Technician,Technician14549,Technician,"  Everyone experiences the upgrade differently.
",48,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14550,Bender," Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay, probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?
",178,68,4,14,Technician,Technician14551,Technician," No, get out.  Next.
",21,68,4,14,Bender,Bender14552,Bender," Well, I guess reality is what you make of it.  Oh, thanks, baby!
",66,68,4,14,Technician,Farnsworth14553,Farnsworth,"  Oh, Lordy Lou! Help!
",23,69,4,15,Bender,Fry14554,Fry,"  I know you've rejected me a lot before but, frankly, I wasn't sure we were right for each other either. But now I am. So how 'bout a date tonight?
",149,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Leela14555,Leela,"  Sorry. I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on.
",54,69,4,15,Fry,Farnsworth14556,Farnsworth,"  Buddha! Zeus! God! One of you guys do something!
",51,69,4,15,Leela,Fry14557,Fry,"  Come on, Leela, what's the real reason you won't go out with me?
",67,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14558,Farnsworth,"  Help! Satan! You owe me!
",27,69,4,15,Fry,Leela14559,Leela,"  Look, um, I'm embarrassed to admit this but you forced me to: I can't go out tonight because...  I have sweaty boot rash.
",124,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Amy14560,Amy," No spluh! Why do you think I'm sitting over here in the stink-free zone?
",74,69,4,15,Leela,Fry14561,Fry," So, will you go out with me?
",30,69,4,15,Amy,Farnsworth14562,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. I'm still technically alive. Yes!  But I need to you to dispose of this crazy-ass experiment that almost killed me.  You'll have to throw it into the sun itself. For only the thermo-nuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction.
",282,69,4,15,Fry,Bender14563,Bender," I can hit it with a shovel.
",29,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14564,Farnsworth," That's not good enough.
",25,69,4,15,Bender,Bender14565,Bender," This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel.
",75,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14566,Farnsworth," Yes, yes.
",11,69,4,15,Bender,Zoidberg14567,Zoidberg," So what's in the box, already?
",32,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14568,Farnsworth," No peeking!  I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend it.
",100,69,4,15,Zoidberg,Hermes14569,Hermes," Ow! You hurt my collator!
",27,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14570,Farnsworth," I don't care.  Listen well: No matter what happens, no matter how great your curiosity, you are forbidden to look in this box. Forbidden!  Pretty tantalising though!
",167,69,4,15,Hermes,Fry14571,Fry," Whatever's in there, it's the only thing I've ever wanted.
",60,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Zoidberg14572,Zoidberg," In my experience, boxes are usually empty. Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top. And one time pepperoni!  What a day that was!   Give me the box!
",157,69,4,15,Fry,Hermes14573,Hermes," Scram, you lousy green snakes!  Here, Leela. Take this and use it to shoot those guys.
",88,69,4,15,Zoidberg,Leela14574,Leela," Right. If they try to look in the box.
",40,69,4,15,Hermes,Hermes14575,Hermes," Whatever.
",11,69,4,15,Leela,Fry14576,Fry," Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away.
",67,69,4,15,Hermes,Bender14577,Bender," Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?
",54,69,4,15,Fry,Fry14578,Fry," No.
",5,69,4,15,Bender,Bender14579,Bender," That's what makes it so funny!  OK, he wasn't joking. Now shut up and follow me.
",82,69,4,15,Fry,Fry14580,Fry,"  Ow! It's hot! The butter in my pocket is melting.
",52,69,4,15,Bender,Bender14581,Bender," We thank you, Bender, for the gift we are about to receive.
",61,69,4,15,Fry,Fry14582,Fry," Tangled-up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them.
",66,69,4,15,Bender,Bender14583,Bender," And unlabeled booze! Wide-mouth too!
",38,69,4,15,Fry,Leela14584,Leela," That oughta keep those dopes occupied.  I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it.
",111,69,4,15,Bender,Leela14585,Leela," Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. What a mockery of justice that I can't take even a little tiny peek.  I need coffee.  OK, heads I look, tails I don't.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Heads! I mean, alright then. No! I have a duty not to look. Well, then again, I promised the coin I would.  Oh, it's deep. Deeper than a small box should be.
",454,69,4,15,Leela,LeelaA14586,LeelaA," Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!
",39,69,4,15,Leela,Fry114587,Fry1," Leela, what have you done?
",28,69,4,15,LeelaA,LeelaA14588,LeelaA," Nothing. What do you mean ""Why was I looking in the box?""
",59,69,4,15,Fry1,Fry114589,Fry1," I mean your hair. It's all different-y.
",41,69,4,15,LeelaA,LeelaA14590,LeelaA," Bender? Is that you?
",22,69,4,15,Fry1,Bender 114591,Bender 1," You know it! Large and in charge!
",35,69,4,15,LeelaA,Farnsworth 114592,Farnsworth 1," Leela? Oh, there's a woman for you! Always dyeing her hair instead of not looking in a box.
",93,69,4,15,Bender 1,LeelaA14593,LeelaA," I didn't dye my hair. This is how I always look.
",50,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Bender 114594,Bender 1," No, that's how you always look.  This throws my entire perception of reality into question. Clone? Robot? Or long-lost twin? Taking all bets! I also offer video poker.
",169,69,4,15,LeelaA,Fry114595,Fry1," It's some guy wearing a Leela costume! Get him!
",49,69,4,15,Bender 1,LeelaA14596,LeelaA," Hold it! You have this all wrong. I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow.
",89,69,4,15,Fry1,Fry114597,Fry1," You shut up, sir!
",19,69,4,15,LeelaA,Farnsworth 114598,Farnsworth 1," No, wait! I've got it. I know what's in the box. Oh, I've been as dumb as Fry.
",80,69,4,15,Fry1,Fry114599,Fry1," Am not!
",9,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Farnsworth 114600,Farnsworth 1," It contains a parallel universe. And when you create a parallel universe, it's almost always populated by evil twins.
",119,69,4,15,Fry1,LeelaA14601,LeelaA," Now, look: I am not evil. My loan officer said so.
",52,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Farnsworth 114602,Farnsworth 1," Oh, you'd like us to believe that wouldn't you, Leela? Or should I say Evil-a?
",80,69,4,15,LeelaA,Bender 114603,Bender 1," Oh, this is awful. Somewhere there's a Bender more evil than me. I do my best, damnit!
",88,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Farnsworth 114604,Farnsworth 1," Leela?  Uh, the good Leela.  I want you to snoop around the other universe and find out how evil they are.  Here.
",115,69,4,15,Bender 1,LeelaA14605,LeelaA," I tell you they're not evil. But don't be confused. They are jerks.
",69,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Zoidberg A14606,Zoidberg A,"  Hello!
",9,69,4,15,LeelaA,Leela114607,Leela1,"  Hi-yah!
",10,69,4,15,Zoidberg A,Zoidberg A14608,Zoidberg A,"  Ow!
",6,69,4,15,Leela1,Leela114609,Leela1," Come out of your universe with your hands up!
",47,69,4,15,Zoidberg A,FryA14610,FryA," Oh, wow! It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip.
",85,69,4,15,Leela1,Farnsworth A14611,Farnsworth A," Astonishing! I must have created a parallel universe.
",55,69,4,15,FryA,Farnsworth 114612,Farnsworth 1," Baldercrap! I created your universe. All you created was my fist parallel to your face.
",89,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Farnsworth A14613,Farnsworth A," Ow.
",5,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,LeelaA14614,LeelaA," Look, it doesn't matter who created what. The important thing is-- Yah!
",73,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Leela114615,Leela1,"  We're exactly the same. I know all her moves. Therefore, I've got the upper hand.
",84,69,4,15,LeelaA,Farnsworth 114616,Farnsworth 1," Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.
",65,69,4,15,Leela1,Farnsworth A14617,Farnsworth A," Let's recap what's happened so far.  As you can see, I accidentally created a box containing your universe.
",109,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Farnsworth 114618,Farnsworth 1," While I, in a simultaneous blunder, created a box containing your universe.
",77,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,LeelaA14619,LeelaA," This is getting confusing. Why don't we call our universe ""Universe A"" and this universe ""Universe B""?
",104,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Bender 114620,Bender 1," Hey! Why can't we be Universe A?
",34,69,4,15,LeelaA,Fry114621,Fry1," Yeah!
",7,69,4,15,Bender 1,Amy114622,Amy1," Yeah!
",7,69,4,15,Fry1,Farnsworth 114623,Farnsworth 1," We want A!
",12,69,4,15,Amy1,Zoidberg 114624,Zoidberg 1," It's the best letter!
",23,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,FryA14625,FryA," We called it first. Besides, this place kinda feels like a ""B"", y'know?
",73,69,4,15,Zoidberg 1,Leela114626,Leela1," Alright, you can be crummy Universe A and we'll be Universe 1.
",64,69,4,15,FryA,Fry114627,Fry1," Or ""The Mongooses"". That's a cool team name. The Fighting Mongooses!
",70,69,4,15,Leela1,Farnsworth A14628,Farnsworth A," Wait a second. If everyone is identical, why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn't?
",101,69,4,15,Fry1,Leela114629,Leela1," Well, to be honest, I tossed a coin. It came up tails so I didn't look.
",73,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,LeelaA14630,LeelaA," That's weird. Mine came up heads, so I did.
",45,69,4,15,Leela1,Farnsworth A14631,Farnsworth A," Interesting. Apparently, the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes.
",110,69,4,15,LeelaA,Bender A14632,Bender A," That explains fruity here!  I tossed a coin to pick my finish. Fog hat grey!
",78,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Bender 114633,Bender 1," Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass!
",35,69,4,15,Bender A,Farnsworth A14634,Farnsworth A," You people and your slight differences disgust me. I'm going home. Where's that blue box with our universe in it?
",115,69,4,15,Bender 1,Farnsworth 114635,Farnsworth 1," Oh, you'd like to get back to your evil universe, wouldn't you? And destroy your box with our universe inside it.
",115,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Farnsworth A14636,Farnsworth A," Nonsense! I would never do such a thing unless you were already having been going to do that!
",95,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Farnsworth 114637,Farnsworth 1," Wha?
",6,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Farnsworth A14638,Farnsworth A," You heard me!
",15,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Farnsworth 114639,Farnsworth 1," In any case, I've hidden the box and it will remain hidden until I'm convinced you're not evil.  Everyone, keep an eye on your evil counterpart.
",146,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Farnsworth A14640,Farnsworth A," And you all do the same!
",26,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Leela114641,Leela1," Um, can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together? We have plans tonight.
",78,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,LeelaA14642,LeelaA,"  You guys are dating?!
",24,69,4,15,Leela1,Fry114643,Fry1," Oh, no, no. We're married.
",28,69,4,15,LeelaA,Bender A14644,Bender A," I've got my eye on you, boy!
",30,69,4,15,Fry1,Bender 114645,Bender 1," Don't even think about it, lunch-pail! You'd be dead before you hit the ground.
",81,69,4,15,Bender A,Bender A14646,Bender A," Good point. Whattya say we just hit a strip joint?
",52,69,4,15,Bender 1,Bender 114647,Bender 1," I was waitin' for one of us to say that!  Bender A, you're a prince among robots. Can you forgive me for distrusting you?
",123,69,4,15,Bender A,Bender A14648,Bender A," Aw! I can't stay mad at what is essentially me. I love me!
",60,69,4,15,Bender 1,Amy114649,Amy1," This is so great! I always wanted an imaginary friend!
",56,69,4,15,Bender A,AmyA14650,AmyA," I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel. We're exactly the same, right down to the--  Splech! Is that pink nail polish?
",113,69,4,15,Amy1,Amy114651,Amy1," Is that not pink nail polish? The Professor's right, you are evil. And shallow.
",81,69,4,15,AmyA,AmyA14652,AmyA," I am not evil!
",16,69,4,15,Amy1,LeelaA14653,LeelaA," So, Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?
",45,69,4,15,AmyA,Fry114654,Fry1," Funny story. I asked Leela out a million times but she just kept rejecting me.
",80,69,4,15,LeelaA,Leela114655,Leela1," I'd make up stuff like ""I have sweaty boot rash"" or ""I have to meet the President""!
",85,69,4,15,Fry1,Fry114656,Fry1," Oh, man, you never heard such excuses! But, like a dope, I believed her. Looking back on it now, it's kinda funny.
",116,69,4,15,Leela1,FryA14657,FryA,"  It sure is. Right, Leela? Funny. Ha ha ha ha!
",48,69,4,15,Fry1,Leela114658,Leela1," Then one night, when Fry asked me out, the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts. I knew he wouldn't buy it, so I did what I always do in those situations.
",164,69,4,15,FryA,LeelaA14659,LeelaA," Oh, Lord...
",13,69,4,15,Leela1,Leela114660,Leela1," I flipped a coin. It came up heads and we went out.
",53,69,4,15,LeelaA,FryA14661,FryA," You mean you flipped a coin too? And it was tails? So that's why you said you had to meet that ghost.
",103,69,4,15,Leela1,Leela114662,Leela1," You really missed out on something, Leela. That date was magical.
",67,69,4,15,FryA,Fry114663,Fry1," One year later, I gave Leela a diamond scrunchie and we were married.
",71,69,4,15,Leela1,LeelaA14664,LeelaA," Ooh!
",6,69,4,15,Fry1,FryA14665,FryA," One year later, I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchie!
",83,69,4,15,LeelaA,Farnsworth 114666,Farnsworth 1," Well, that was pointless.
",27,69,4,15,FryA,Farnsworth A14667,Farnsworth A," Say, I hope you won't think it ""evil"" of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound.
",89,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Farnsworth 114668,Farnsworth 1," Oh, this old thing? I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain.
",80,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Farnsworth A14669,Farnsworth A," Of course! I had the same idea. I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed. But it came up tails, so I didn't. How'd it go?
",129,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Farnsworth 114670,Farnsworth 1," Well getting the brain out was the easy part. The hard part was getting the brain out!
",88,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Farnsworth A14671,Farnsworth A," Oh, you!
",10,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Zoidberg 114672,Zoidberg 1," So, tell me about yourself.
",29,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Zoidberg A14673,Zoidberg A," Well, don't look into it, but I'm a respected internal medicine doctor. Ooh! A can!
",85,69,4,15,Zoidberg 1,Zoidberg 114674,Zoidberg 1," As for me, I design mansions, then live in them.   I'm lying! I'm an appalling failure!
",89,69,4,15,Zoidberg A,Zoidberg A14675,Zoidberg A,"  Me too! A big, fat one!
",26,69,4,15,Zoidberg 1,Zoidberg 114676,Zoidberg 1," And those co-workers, always looking down on us Zoidbergs. What are they, from Nob Hill?
",90,69,4,15,Zoidberg A,Zoidberg A14677,Zoidberg A," They're all like ""Stop spraying me with ink, Zoidberg!"" ""Put on pants, Zoidberg!"" ""Don't touch our fancy box, Zoidberg!""
",122,69,4,15,Zoidberg 1,Zoidberg 114678,Zoidberg 1," Oh, that box! Too good for us, is it?
",39,69,4,15,Zoidberg A,Zoidberg A14679,Zoidberg A," Bah! Someday they'll watch from down in the gutter, they will, as King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box.
",107,69,4,15,Zoidberg 1,Zoidberg 114680,Zoidberg 1," You know, maybe a certain blue lobster saw where Professor hid the box.
",73,69,4,15,Zoidberg A,Farnsworth 114681,Farnsworth 1," Good news, everyones!
",23,69,4,15,Zoidberg 1,Farnsworth A14682,Farnsworth A," After carefully reading the scriptures, we've concluded that none of us are evil.
",83,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Farnsworth 114683,Farnsworth 1," Yes, the Bible is the real good news. Anyhow, you're all free to go back to your own universe.
",96,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Hermes114684,Hermes1," What's goin' on here? Why aren't you all out destroying the Professor's box?
",78,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Leela114685,Leela1," Hermes, aren't you curious about the fact that there's two of everybody?
",74,69,4,15,Hermes1,Hermes114686,Hermes1," No. Now like my granny used to say back in her tarpaper shack on Montego Bay, ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself.""
",147,69,4,15,Leela1,Farnsworth 114687,Farnsworth 1," Your granny can go to hell! I've hidden the box so no one can destroy the home universe of my handsome friend here.
",117,69,4,15,Hermes1,Farnsworth A14688,Farnsworth A," Oh, go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe...
",98,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Farnsworth 114689,Farnsworth 1," Then your Hermes...
",21,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Farnsworth A14690,Farnsworth A," Oh, my!
",9,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Narrator14691,Narrator,"  And sure enough...
",21,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Hermes14692,Hermes," Like Granny said, ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself."" God rest her zombie bones.
",114,69,4,15,Narrator,LeelaA14693,LeelaA," So we go back through the box and stop Hermes?
",48,69,4,15,Hermes,Farnsworth A14694,Farnsworth A," Right. Good thing Professor B there hid it in the coelacanth tank. No one but a crazy lobster would look there!
",113,69,4,15,LeelaA,Farnsworth 114695,Farnsworth 1,"  It's gone!
",13,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Zoidberg A14696,Zoidberg A," All hail Zoidberg, the king with the box!  Now it's my turn, maybe?
",69,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Zoidberg 114697,Zoidberg 1," The box says no.
",18,69,4,15,Zoidberg A,Narrator14698,Narrator,"  Meanwhile in Universe A, Hermes A heads towards the sun ... A.
",65,69,4,15,Zoidberg 1,Hermes14699,Hermes," Item one: Box. Check! Item two: Sun.  That's a big check.
",59,69,4,15,Narrator,Hermes114700,Hermes1,"  If I know parallel Hermes, he's at the sun by now.
",53,69,4,15,Hermes,Bender 114701,Bender 1," Our universe is doomed!
",25,69,4,15,Hermes1,Bender 1 and Bender A14702,Bender 1 and Bender A," Doooooooomed!
",15,69,4,15,Bender 1,Farnsworth 114703,Farnsworth 1," Now don't give up yet, you cry babies. The box is gone but we still have one preposterously slim hope.
",104,69,4,15,Bender 1 and Bender A,AmyA14704,AmyA," Is it a kind of hairspray?
",28,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Farnsworth A14705,Farnsworth A," No! We must attempt to make another box containing our universe. Doy!
",71,69,4,15,AmyA,Fry114706,Fry1," Well? Is that your universe in there?
",39,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,FryA14707,FryA,"  Nope. Too cold.
",18,69,4,15,Fry1,Farnsworth A14708,Farnsworth A,"  Hmm! All women!  I'll put this one aside for later.
",54,69,4,15,FryA,Hermes114709,Hermes1," Oh, man, it's hopeless! We'll never find your universe in time. Plus, this box is stuck on my fat head.
",105,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Farnsworth 114710,Farnsworth 1," Yes, it's the apocalypse alright. I always thought I'd have a hand in it.
",75,69,4,15,Hermes1,Bender 114711,Bender 1," I'm not sad because I finally found someone as great as me. It's like I always say, ""Make new friends and keep the old. One is silver--""
",138,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Bender A14712,Bender A," ""And the other's gold.""
",25,69,4,15,Bender 1,Zoidberg 114713,Zoidberg 1," Why with the long faces?
",26,69,4,15,Bender A,Leela114714,Leela1," The idiots have the box!
",26,69,4,15,Zoidberg 1,Zoidberg A14715,Zoidberg A," I think she means you.
",24,69,4,15,Leela1,Farnsworth 114716,Farnsworth 1," Grab them!
",12,69,4,15,Zoidberg A,Zoidberg 114717,Zoidberg 1,"  You coward! Wait for me!
",27,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Amy14718,Amy," Blug! Which one did they go into?
",35,69,4,15,Zoidberg 1,Farnsworth A14719,Farnsworth A,"  Oh, let's all ask each other! That'll solve this problem!
",60,69,4,15,Amy,Farnsworth 114720,Farnsworth 1," We'll each have to search a universe. Everyone, grab a length of wire first so you can find your way back.
",108,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Amy114721,Amy1," Hello? Did you see two smelly lobsters?
",41,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Hermes2514722,Hermes25," We didn't see anything ...  ... ever!
",39,69,4,15,Amy1,Fry14723,Fry," Yo! Uh, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?
",44,69,4,15,Hermes25,Fry914724,Fry9," Hell, no!
",11,69,4,15,Fry,Leela914725,Leela9," Shut up!
",10,69,4,15,Fry9,Bender 914726,Bender 9," Beat it, jerk!
",16,69,4,15,Leela9,LeelaA14727,LeelaA," Uh, have you robot versions of you guys seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?
",79,69,4,15,Bender 9,Fry3114728,Fry31,"  Negative. Will you go out with me?
",37,69,4,15,LeelaA,LeelaA14729,LeelaA," Uh, access denied.
",20,69,4,15,Fry31,Bender 114730,Bender 1," Hey, pal, look what I snagged from the Leprechaun Universe!
",61,69,4,15,LeelaA,Bender14731,Bender," Yeah, Leprechaun Universe is fine ... if you haven't seen Pirate Universe!
",76,69,4,15,Bender 1,Bender 114732,Bender 1," Faith and begorra!
",20,69,4,15,Bender,Farnsworth XVII14733,Farnsworth XVII," Quae?
",7,69,4,15,Bender 1,Zoidberg A14734,Zoidberg A," Quick! Into another box!
",26,69,4,15,Farnsworth XVII,Zoidberg 114735,Zoidberg 1," There aren't any in this universe, there aren't. Hey, you, what with the no boxes?
",84,69,4,15,Zoidberg A,Farnsworth14736,Farnsworth," Baby, they're somewhere. Everything's like somewhere! Place is kinda au naturel right now.
",92,69,4,15,Zoidberg 1,Farnsworth 114737,Farnsworth 1," There they are!
",17,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth A14738,Farnsworth A," Gotcha!
",9,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Farnsworth14739,Farnsworth," Dig it! All of you fitting in this boxed is like seriously freaked up!
",72,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Farnsworth 114740,Farnsworth 1," Nonsense! Why, there's a whole universe in there.
",51,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14741,Farnsworth," Dude, there's a universe in all of us.
",40,69,4,15,Farnsworth 1,Amy14742,Amy," Right on, Professor Freaksworth!
",34,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth A14743,Farnsworth A," Get a job!   We've got the box. Everyone, pull your wires.
",60,69,4,15,Amy,Farnsworth A14744,Farnsworth A," Hurry! Back to Universe A!
",28,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Farnsworth A14745,Farnsworth A," Hermes, don't press that button!
",34,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,Hermes14746,Hermes," OK.
",5,69,4,15,Farnsworth A,FryA14747,FryA," Bye.
",6,69,4,15,Hermes,LeelaA14748,LeelaA," Good luck, Leela.
",19,69,4,15,FryA,Zoidberg A14749,Zoidberg A," So long, Your Majesty!
",24,69,4,15,LeelaA,Amy114750,Amy1," Later!
",8,69,4,15,Zoidberg A,Fry14751,Fry," There but for the flip of a coin go we. So, um, Leela? Seeing how the universe wasn't destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight? You know, together?
",148,69,4,15,Amy1,Leela14752,Leela," Well, I guess you deserve one more flip.
",42,69,4,15,Fry,Fry14753,Fry," So, heads or tails?
",21,69,4,15,Leela,Leela14754,Leela," Y'know, let's just say it's heads.
",36,69,4,15,Fry,Farnsworth14755,Farnsworth," Ready?
",8,69,4,15,Leela,Farnsworth14756,Farnsworth," and  One, two, three, pull!
",29,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14757,Farnsworth," There. That space-time eversion has given us their box and vice versa.
",72,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Leela14758,Leela," So, what you think you just explained to us is that--
",55,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14759,Farnsworth," Correct! This box contains our own universe.
",46,69,4,15,Leela,Hermes14760,Hermes," Sweet honey bee of infinity!
",30,69,4,15,Farnsworth,Leela14761,Leela," Bender! Quit destroying the universe!
",39,69,4,15,Hermes,Bender14762,Bender," But--
",7,69,4,15,Leela,Farnsworth14763,Farnsworth," Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box. And the box itself is probably worth something too. We must cherish it, as we cherish every moment of our lives.
",165,69,4,15,Bender,Announcer #114764,Announcer #1,"  This week in the universe.  Dateline, Turantulon 6: The brave warriors of Earth, under the command of General Major Webelo Zapp Brannigan, have achieved victory over the spider homeworld.

",269,70,4,16,Farnsworth,Zapp14765,Zapp,"  Mmm!
",7,70,4,16,Announcer #1,Nixon14766,Nixon,"  My fellow Earthicans, after meeting with top voodoo economists, I have decided to refund our silk surplus to you, the taxpayers. That's right! I've sent you each 300 buckaroos in the form of a Tricky Dick Fun Bill. Knock yourselves out!
",239,70,4,16,Zapp,Zoidberg14767,Zoidberg," Money!
",8,70,4,16,Nixon,Amy14768,Amy," I'm slightly richer!

",66,70,4,16,Amy,Leela14770,Leela," I'm going to swim with a whale. They're the gentle giants of the deep.
",72,70,4,16,Bender,Farnsworth14771,Farnsworth," I'm well aware of that.
",25,70,4,16,Leela,Scruffy14772,Scruffy," Scruffy's gonna get himself one of them $300 haircuts. This one's lost its pizzazz!
",85,70,4,16,Farnsworth,Zoidberg14773,Zoidberg," A fortune, it is! At last Zoidberg will live like a rich man!
",63,70,4,16,Scruffy,Nixon14774,Nixon,"  Hey, cut it out! Go away! Get away!
",38,70,4,16,Zoidberg,Amy14775,Amy," Shmeesh! It's just 300 bucks. What is that, like a hundred cups of coffee?
",76,70,4,16,Nixon,Fry14776,Fry," That's it! I'm getting a hundred cups of coffee. Starting now.  Coffee machine, one cup of coffee, please.
",108,70,4,16,Amy,Nixon14777,Nixon,"  Smells good!

",5,70,4,16,Zapp,Zapp14780,Zapp,"  Oh, yes, you are! I'm hereby inviting you and your oddball co-workers to a special reception to display the national silk surplus. I believe you know the heroic space stallion who captured it. Show them my medal, Kif.

",41,70,4,16,Kif,Leela14783,Leela," What little there is to be had.

",52,70,4,16,Crack Addict,Amy14787,Amy," Oh, Kif, it was so romantic of you to rent this paddle plane with your tax rebate. We're like two dandelion seeds wafting on the breeze.

",26,70,4,16,Amy,Amy14789,Amy," I almost feel kinda shallow for blowing my rebate on this cool talking tattoo!

",62,70,4,16,Amy,Amy14791,Amy," Shut up!  Ow!
",15,70,4,16,Tattoo #1,Farnsworth14792,Farnsworth," Uh, ma'am, it has become too much of a chore for me to clean out my wrinkles each day. Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process?
",144,70,4,16,Amy,Geneworks Woman #114793,Geneworks Woman #1," Well, yes. In the same way an infant may fight Muhammad Ali. But--
",68,70,4,16,Farnsworth,Farnsworth14794,Farnsworth," One pound of stem cells, please.
",34,70,4,16,Geneworks Woman #1,Geneworks Woman #114795,Geneworks Woman #1," Of course, any age-reversing effects will be purely temporary.
",64,70,4,16,Farnsworth,Bender14796,Bender," Say, buddy, why's this Grand Cigar so pricey?
",47,70,4,16,Geneworks Woman #1,Clerk14797,Clerk," Well, as you can see, its wrapper is a piece of the original US Constitution. It was hand-rolled by Queen Elizabeth during her wild years and was buried with George Burns until graverobbing space mushrooms-- Uh, well you know the rest.
",237,70,4,16,Bender,Bender14798,Bender," Give you 300 bucks for it.
",28,70,4,16,Clerk,Clerk14799,Clerk," No can do.

",42,70,4,16,Whale Biologist,Whale Biologist14819,Whale Biologist," I don't know you well enough to get into that. $300, please.  Noon tomorrow. If you're late you only get to tread water in the scallop tank.

",72,70,4,16,Kif,Amy14836,Amy," Hey, it is kinda like that.
",29,70,4,16,Zoidberg,Zoidberg14837,Zoidberg," To induce vomiting, that was the solution. Everywhere it went!  What a Valentine's Day that was!
",98,70,4,16,Amy,Leela14838,Leela," Hmm. This may seem like a huge coincidence, but I happen to have an in with that whale.
",89,70,4,16,Zoidberg,Scruffy14839,Scruffy," Scruffy's formulated a plan, but you'll need a ready source of nauseatin' rotten fish.

",17,71,4,17,Narrator,Narrator14965,Narrator,"  Sadly, logging and human settlement today threaten what might possibly be his habitat. Although if it's not, they don't. Bigfoot populations require vast amounts of land to remain elusive in.  They typically dwell just behind rocks but are also sometimes playful, bounding into thick fogs and out-of-focus areas.

",53,71,4,17,Bender,Ranger Park14978,Ranger Park," What you saw was Bigfoot the monster truck. But thanks for a great question.
",78,71,4,17,Petunia,Fry14979,Fry," Sir, if I may, why don't you just set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and see if he walks by one?
",112,71,4,17,Ranger Park,Ranger Park14980,Ranger Park," Ah, that would be very expensive, and most people who believe in Bigfoot are broke.

",19,71,4,17,Fry,Fry14994,Fry," Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the others, Bigfoot; I see through your monster coatings to the gentle loner inside. I bet you have a wounded racoon friend that you tenderly nurse back to health while you go...  But in the end they shoot you. But you teach us about things.  Oh. Just a flying saucer.  Excuse me? You can't park here. The parking area's over there.  Wow! Nice tube.  Hey! Hey, what's the big idea? Stop abducting me. Why does your vanity plate say ""Probe 1""?

",126,71,4,17,Leela,Farnsworth15001,Farnsworth," Fry! What in Sega Genesis happened to you?
",44,71,4,17,Fry,Fry15002,Fry," That's what I'm trying to tell you. See--  Why are you all staring at me like that? Is there something on my face?
",116,71,4,17,Farnsworth,Hermes15003,Hermes," Uh ... no.
",12,71,4,17,Fry,Leela15004,Leela," Someone should tell him.
",26,71,4,17,Hermes,Fry15005,Fry," Tell me what?
",15,71,4,17,Leela,Leela15006,Leela," Nothing.
",10,71,4,17,Fry,Zoidberg15007,Zoidberg," Well I have a lot of experience telling patients bad news, so let me break it to him gently.   Fry, you have no nose! Your nose is gone! You have no nose on your face! Where it is I can't say but on your face it's not!
",220,71,4,17,Leela,Fry15008,Fry," What?
",7,71,4,17,Zoidberg,Bender15009,Bender," Aww! I think it's sweet. You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your hero. Me, Bender!

",46,71,4,17,Bender,Farnsworth15011,Farnsworth," Which last night?
",19,71,4,17,Fry,Fry15012,Fry," In the woods. I was walking ... for Bigfoot, looking ... and then aliens beamed me up.
",88,71,4,17,Farnsworth,Amy15013,Amy," Were they little grey dudes with big oval heads?  I don't get that gesture. Am I wrong?
",89,71,4,17,Fry,Zoidberg15014,Zoidberg," Cheer up, friend. When we get home a high-quality prosthesis will have you looking good as new.
",97,71,4,17,Amy,Fry15015,Fry," I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined.
",42,71,4,17,Zoidberg,Hermes15016,Hermes," Man, you are such a jokester!
",31,71,4,17,Fry,Fry15017,Fry," I'll never have another moment of happiness.
",46,71,4,17,Hermes,Leela15018,Leela," I know you're trying to mask your pain with humour, but don't worry. I'm sure the Professor can clone you a new nose.
",119,71,4,17,Fry,Fry15019,Fry,"  Eh, it wouldn't be the same. I want my nose. I don't want to have to teach a new one how to shoot milk when I laugh.
",119,71,4,17,Leela,Farnsworth15020,Farnsworth," Well there's no sense fretting. Good Lord, you're ugly! The fact is your nose is gone and we'll never find out who did it or why.
",131,71,4,17,Fry,Bender15021,Bender,"  Guys! Guys! There's something on television.
",47,71,4,17,Farnsworth,Linda15022,Linda,"  Alien abductions: Until now, a harmless nuisance. But recently they've taken on a sinister dimension as unsuspecting victims are returned ... without noses.

",10,71,4,17,Linda,Morbo15024,Morbo,"  The culprits: Shameless poachers, hunting humans without a permit.
",69,71,4,17,Fry,Linda15025,Linda,"  The valuable nose, or ""human horn"", fetches a high price on alien worlds as an aphrodisiac.
",94,71,4,17,Morbo,Fry15026,Fry," My nose is an aphrodisiac?  I'm gonna drop a barf!
",52,71,4,17,Linda,Morbo15027,Morbo,"  Demand for human horn is great, due, in part, to titillating scenes from depraved alien TV programmes too filthy for Earth broadcast. Let's watch.

",39,71,4,17,Morbo,Neptunian Man #115029,Neptunian Man #1,"  So is our love.
",18,71,4,17,Neptunian Woman #1,Fry15030,Fry," Blech! We have to track down my nose before some alien snarfs it and does the worm. Who's in?
",95,71,4,17,Neptunian Man #1,Leela15031,Leela," Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg if he feels like it.
",55,71,4,17,Fry,Zoidberg15032,Zoidberg," No, I'm good.
",15,71,4,17,Leela,Alien15033,Alien," Let's see, I'll take a pancreas, two sphincters and a large Coke.
",67,71,4,17,Zoidberg,Vendor15034,Vendor," One number three combo!
",25,71,4,17,Alien,Fry15035,Fry," It's no use. We've been to every scuzzy bazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery Barn.
",87,71,4,17,Vendor,Leela15036,Leela," Wait. What's that?
",20,71,4,17,Fry,Salesman #115037,Salesman #1," Welcome, friends. How may I pervert you?
",42,71,4,17,Leela,Fry15038,Fry," Uh, I'm looking for human horn.
",33,71,4,17,Salesman #1,Salesman #115039,Salesman #1,"  Shh! You're not cops, right?
",31,71,4,17,Fry,Leela15040,Leela," Of course not. In fact, he's a crook.
",39,71,4,17,Salesman #1,Bender15041,Bender," Yep. Stolen Pez anyone?
",25,71,4,17,Leela,Salesman #115042,Salesman #1," Right this way.
",17,71,4,17,Bender,Salesman #115043,Salesman #1," Human horn. So fresh you can still see the eyeglass marks.
",60,71,4,17,Salesman #1,Fry15044,Fry," Nope. Uh-uh. Ew!  Now look. This is the nose we want. Did you sell it to somebody?
",84,71,4,17,Salesman #1,Salesman #115045,Salesman #1," I'm sorry, sir, but due to the perverted nature of our business, customer records are strictly confidential.  Right this way.
",127,71,4,17,Fry,Salesman #115046,Salesman #1," I video-tape everyone who comes in here so I can blackmail them later.  Hey, I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Here's the weirdo who bought your horn.
",178,71,4,17,Salesman #1,Leela15047,Leela," That's Lrrr! Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
",52,71,4,17,Salesman #1,Lrrr15048,Lrrr,"  You got any, uh, you know, uh  human horn?
",45,71,4,17,Leela,Salesman #115049,Salesman #1,"  Speak up! You're muttering!
",30,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15050,Lrrr,"  I said, uh  human horn?
",26,71,4,17,Salesman #1,Salesman #115051,Salesman #1,"  You're not a cop, right?
",27,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15052,Lrrr,"  Oh, no, no. I'm just some guy ... ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8!
",74,71,4,17,Salesman #1,Lrrr15053,Lrrr," So let me get this straight: If I buy eight Caramello bars, you all get to go to some camp.
",93,71,4,17,Lrrr,Bender15054,Bender," Yep. That's exactly the lie we used to get past your guards.
",62,71,4,17,Lrrr,Fry15055,Fry," Oh, great space king, I humbly beg you to return my human horn.
",65,71,4,17,Bender,Lrrr15056,Lrrr," Uh, human horn? How ridiculous! Why would a virile male like Lrrr need human horn? I don't even know what it's for. What is it, something you-you put in salad dressing?
",170,71,4,17,Fry,Ndnd15057,Ndnd," Like you've ever seen a salad.
",32,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15058,Lrrr," My weight is appropriate and attractive!
",42,71,4,17,Ndnd,Leela15059,Leela," Whoa! You guys have issues.
",29,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15060,Lrrr," She has issues! I'm fine! But there's no human horn around here, so make friends with the door.
",97,71,4,17,Leela,Fry15061,Fry,"  Alright. I give up. I guess I'll just go home and marry a skunk.
",67,71,4,17,Lrrr,Ndnd15062,Ndnd," Oh, let's just give it to him.  Here.
",39,71,4,17,Fry,Fry15063,Fry," My nose! Light of my face!
",28,71,4,17,Ndnd,Lrrr15064,Lrrr," Uh, what is that? How do you have that, Nd-Nd?  I've never seen it before. My friend left it here.
",100,71,4,17,Fry,Leela15065,Leela," Hold still, Fry. I can reattach it with my emergency face laser.
",66,71,4,17,Lrrr,Fry15066,Fry," Hey! You burned my cheek!
",27,71,4,17,Leela,Leela15067,Leela," Yeah, sorry, I wasn't really concentrating.
",45,71,4,17,Fry,Fry15068,Fry," No, I mean the singed flesh, I can smell it!  And those lilacs on the table.
",78,71,4,17,Leela,Lrrr15069,Lrrr," At least someone noticed.
",27,71,4,17,Fry,Ndnd15070,Ndnd," For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your first wife was the one who liked lilacs.
",87,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15071,Lrrr," She also liked to shut up!
",28,71,4,17,Ndnd,Fry15072,Fry," Well, great seeing you. I guess we'll be on our--
",51,71,4,17,Lrrr,Bender15073,Bender," Yo, Highness. Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's nose for an aphrodisiac instead of his, you know, wing-dang-doodle?
",141,71,4,17,Fry,Lrrr15074,Lrrr," But, uh, I thought the horn was the human wing-dang-doodle.
",61,71,4,17,Bender,Bender15075,Bender," No, sir, chief! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet. Ever seen soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their noses, I'll tell you that much. Well, see you!
",205,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15076,Lrrr," Interesting. The trousers conceal a tiny secondary horn.
",58,71,4,17,Bender,Fry15077,Fry," Hey, what've you heard?
",25,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15078,Lrrr,"  Guards! Seize him!  Prepare to harvest the lower horn!
",57,71,4,17,Fry,Fry15079,Fry," OK, you can have my nose.
",27,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15080,Lrrr," Guards!
",9,71,4,17,Fry,Guard #1 #115081,Guard #1 #1," Yeah?
",7,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15082,Lrrr," Remove the human's lower horn and prepare it to be eaten by me.
",65,71,4,17,Guard #1 #1,Ndnd15083,Ndnd," In other words, slop a lot of ketchup and salt on it.
",55,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15084,Lrrr," Then bring it to our royal bedchamber and put it in the sock drawer with all the other things that have failed to arouse my passion for this woman.
",149,71,4,17,Ndnd,Guard #1 #215085,Guard #1 #2," Remove pants!
",15,71,4,17,Lrrr,Fry15086,Fry," Wait! Listen. I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn--
",69,71,4,17,Guard #1 #2,Bender15087,Bender,"  I'll say!
",12,71,4,17,Fry,Fry15088,Fry," But in this case I-I just don't think it'll do any good.
",58,71,4,17,Bender,Bender15089,Bender,"  That's what she said!
",24,71,4,17,Fry,Leela15090,Leela," Let's face it, you two have deep relationship problems that can't be solved by an aphrodisiac.
",96,71,4,17,Bender,Fry15091,Fry," However huge it might be.
",27,71,4,17,Leela,Ndnd15092,Ndnd," So what do you suggest, painfully-single human?
",49,71,4,17,Fry,Leela15093,Leela," Well, why don't you think back to what brought you together in the first place?
",81,71,4,17,Ndnd,Ndnd15094,Ndnd," Oh, I don't know. Lrrr used to be so tender.
",46,71,4,17,Leela,Lrrr15095,Lrrr," I only wrote that poem to test my printer.
",44,71,4,17,Ndnd,Ndnd15096,Ndnd," We'd go walking in the woods and Lrrr would find injured little tinkle-bunnies and nurse them back to health.
",111,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15097,Lrrr," Yes, but I'm the one who injured them!
",40,71,4,17,Ndnd,Ndnd15098,Ndnd," Oh, shush. You stepped on them by accident and then you cried all night. That's the kind of sensitive man you used to be.
",123,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15099,Lrrr," And you used to wear a size-3 cape.  But not anymore! Now bring me that lower horn while I'm still in the mood.
",113,71,4,17,Ndnd,Fry15100,Fry," Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of mutilating me?
",85,71,4,17,Lrrr,Leela15101,Leela," Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there for a romantic dinner under the stars.
",110,71,4,17,Fry,Ndnd15102,Ndnd," Hmm. Sounds interesting. But he would never do it.
",52,71,4,17,Leela,Lrrr15103,Lrrr," Like hell I wouldn't. I'm not gonna be blamed for not going.
",62,71,4,17,Ndnd,Fry15104,Fry," Then it's a deal. We get one night. I keep my horn as long as you two end up doing the horizontal monster mash.
",113,71,4,17,Lrrr,Bender15105,Bender," I don't get it!
",17,71,4,17,Fry,Bender15106,Bender," Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine for the edge of the table?
",67,71,4,17,Bender,Lrrr15107,Lrrr," No, thanks. Just water, please. Tap water!
",44,71,4,17,Bender,Ndnd15108,Ndnd,"  Oh, big spender!
",19,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15109,Lrrr,"  That's it! This date is over. Waiter!
",40,71,4,17,Ndnd,Fry15110,Fry," So, what can I get you this evening?
",38,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15111,Lrrr," Your lower horn!
",18,71,4,17,Fry,Fry15112,Fry," I'll just start you off with some bread. Some sexy, arousing bread!
",69,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15113,Lrrr," Fine! But none of that whole-grain goat food. And bring plenty of melted butter.
",82,71,4,17,Fry,Ndnd15114,Ndnd," Why don't you just inject some fat straight into your ass and cut out the middle man?
",87,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15115,Lrrr," One of these days, Nd-Nd. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the third moon of Omicron Persei 8!
",87,71,4,17,Ndnd,Lrrr15116,Lrrr,"  Mmm! This jerked chicken is good. I think I'll have Fry's lower horn jerked.
",79,71,4,17,Lrrr,Bender15117,Bender,"  It's used to it!
",19,71,4,17,Lrrr,Fry15118,Fry," So, uh, how are you two snooky-poopums doing?
",47,71,4,17,Bender,Ndnd15119,Ndnd," Poorly.
",9,71,4,17,Fry,Lrrr15120,Lrrr," My wife is right, for once. There's very little magic in the air. Ready the lower horn transport vessel.
",106,71,4,17,Ndnd,Bender15121,Bender," Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin?  Hey, uh, mind if I stick these in here?
",102,71,4,17,Lrrr,Guard #1 #115122,Guard #1 #1," Go for it.
",12,71,4,17,Bender,Leela15123,Leela," Don't worry, Fry. Things look bad but I still have a trump card; the most beautiful love song ever written.
 And I will always love you,
Will always love you.
",160,71,4,17,Guard #1 #1,Ndnd15124,Ndnd," The humans are attacking!
",27,71,4,17,Leela,Lrrr15125,Lrrr," Pluck the lower horn and let's get out of here!
",49,71,4,17,Ndnd,Bender15126,Bender," Quick, Fry! Run for it!
",25,71,4,17,Lrrr,Fry15127,Fry," Come on, freedom cage! Roll me to safety!  Yes! I never thought I'd escape with my doodle, but I pulled it out!
",113,71,4,17,Bender,Bender15128,Bender,"  Just like at the movie theatre!
",34,71,4,17,Fry,Lrrr15129,Lrrr," Give me that!
",15,71,4,17,Bender,Fry15130,Fry," Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it! The Loch Ness Monster's book was right!
",72,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15131,Lrrr," Well, hello there, my furry friend.
",37,71,4,17,Fry,Ndnd15132,Ndnd," Look at his adorable little feet.  Yes, you are a cutie-pie.
",62,71,4,17,Lrrr,Ranger Park15133,Ranger Park," Holy macaroni!  I can't believe I'm seeing Bigfoot! He's in focus! Oh, I've waited my entire life for this moment.
",116,71,4,17,Ndnd,Ndnd15134,Ndnd," What?
",7,71,4,17,Ranger Park,Bender15135,Bender," What are you doing with that?
",31,71,4,17,Ndnd,Lrrr15136,Lrrr," You're going to kill this innocent giganto?
",45,71,4,17,Bender,Ranger Park15137,Ranger Park," Of course not. I'm just gonna tranquilize him so I can chop off his feet as proof he exists. Then dump him back in the wild. He'll do fine.
",141,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15138,Lrrr," You'll have to get through me first.
",38,71,4,17,Ranger Park,Ranger Park15139,Ranger Park," OK. Nighty night!
",19,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15140,Lrrr," Now leave this gentle Sasquatch, or Wood Ape, in peace so I can finally and at long last harvest this pathetic human's lower horn.
",132,71,4,17,Ranger Park,Fry15141,Fry," Yeah!
",7,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15142,Lrrr," Wait. What am I saying? If I poach this beast's lower horn, am I any better than that ranger with his demented foot lust? Yes. But not by enough.
",147,71,4,17,Fry,Ranger Park15143,Ranger Park," Score!
",8,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15144,Lrrr," This human's lower horn is one of God's creatures, a living thing, and all living things, large and small--
",109,71,4,17,Ranger Park,Bender15145,Bender,"  In this case ""small""!
",24,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15146,Lrrr," Have dignity and a spark of the divine.
",41,71,4,17,Bender,Ndnd15147,Ndnd," That's the gentle, sensitive, poet warlord I fell in love with.
",65,71,4,17,Lrrr,Lrrr15148,Lrrr,"  Uh, you'll wanna retreat to a safe, 500-metre radius!
",56,71,4,17,Ndnd,Leela15149,Leela," Well, Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn.
",64,71,4,17,Lrrr,Bender15150,Bender," As usual!   Run away!
",23,71,4,17,Leela,Narrator15151,Narrator,"  You're on a scenic route through a state recreation known as the human mind. You ask a passer-by for directions, only to find he has no face or something. Suddenly, up ahead, a door in the road. You swerve, narrowly avoiding The Scary Door.
",243,71,4,17,Bender,Scientist15152,Scientist,"  I have combined the DNA of the world's most evil animals to make the most evil creature of them all.
",103,71,4,17,Narrator,Man #115153,Man #1,"  It turns out it's Man.
",25,71,4,17,Scientist,Bender15154,Bender," Huh?  I choose to not understand these signs.
",47,72,4,18,Man #1,Bender15155,Bender," Aha!
",6,72,4,18,Bender,Fry15156,Fry," Bender? I was just not playing the holophonor.
",48,72,4,18,Bender,Bender15157,Bender," Yeah, well you should try not stinking at it.
",47,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15158,Fry," I am trying. I've been taking lessons.
",40,72,4,18,Bender,Bender15159,Bender," Lessons? Oh, that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way?
",101,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15160,Fry," I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me.  Hey, Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday. I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?
",270,72,4,18,Bender,Bender15161,Bender," Fine, I'll go already. Y'know, sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive. Not often, though.
",104,72,4,18,Fry,Bender15162,Bender," Whoa! Hey!
",12,72,4,18,Bender,Fry15163,Fry," Uh, hello, Mrs. Mellonger.
",28,72,4,18,Bender,Mrs. Mellonger15164,Mrs. Mellonger," Hello, Philip.  And you must be Mr. Bender. Philip's told me so much about you. Is it true that you're a robot?
",113,72,4,18,Fry,Bender15165,Bender," I prefer the term ""love machine"".
",35,72,4,18,Mrs. Mellonger,Bender15166,Bender," Wow! Your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?
",66,72,4,18,Bender,Mother15167,Mother," Fairly hard.
",14,72,4,18,Bender,Fry15168,Fry," The Grumpy Snail.  Sorry!
",27,72,4,18,Mother,Boy15169,Boy,"  It's too grumpy!
",19,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15170,Fry," Ow! No! Quit it! Stop!
",24,72,4,18,Boy,Mrs. Mellonger15171,Mrs. Mellonger," Mr. Bender, I simply cannot teach your child.
",47,72,4,18,Fry,Bender15172,Bender," Then good day, madam!  We hope to see you soon for tea.
",57,72,4,18,Mrs. Mellonger,Fry15173,Fry," It's hopeless! I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't keep up.
",94,72,4,18,Bender,Bender15174,Bender," Aww. You know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes.
",81,72,4,18,Fry,Leela15175,Leela," Hey, guys. You missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?
",86,72,4,18,Bender,Fry15176,Fry," At, uh, uh, a concert.
",24,72,4,18,Leela,Leela15177,Leela," Ooh! Was it jazz noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
",139,72,4,18,Fry,Bender15178,Bender," So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein, huh?
",51,72,4,18,Leela,Leela15179,Leela," Yeah, it's weird; Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched--
",81,72,4,18,Bender,Fry15180,Fry,"  Pretty boy.
",14,72,4,18,Leela,Leela15181,Leela," But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibres on his butt.  I couldn't believe it. I was really...
",178,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15182,Fry," That could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
",109,72,4,18,Leela,Bender15183,Bender," Oh, but you can. Though you may have to metaphorically make a ""deal with the devil"". And by ""devil"" I mean ""Robot Devil"". And by ""metaphorically"" I mean ""get your coat"".
",171,72,4,18,Fry,Robot #1 Devil15184,Robot #1 Devil," You hit a sour note about 200 years back, Doug!  Let's take it from the top.  Ah, Bender, Fry. You've come back for more eternal damnation.
",141,72,4,18,Bender,Bender15185,Bender," No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons.
",70,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Fry15186,Fry," Yep. I need to get really good without practising.
",52,72,4,18,Bender,Robot #1 Devil15187,Robot #1 Devil," Hell is full of ten-year-olds who wanted exactly the same thing. Trouble is, you have what my old music teacher, Mrs. Mellonger, calls ""stupid fingers"".  With hands like that you'll be lucky to master a belt buckle.  Now wouldn't it be nice if you had a pair of robot hands to replace them?
",292,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15188,Fry," Sure would.  Oh, well. Goodbye.
",33,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Bender15189,Bender," Fry, you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you.
",96,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15190,Fry," He-He-He is?  Great! Wait, what's the catch?
",46,72,4,18,Bender,Robot #1 Devil15191,Robot #1 Devil," No catch. I'll merely pick a robot at random from somewhere in the universe, probably one you've never even met, and then I'll remove his hands and switch them for yours.  It's just the sort of guy I am. What do you say?
",222,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15192,Fry," I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to--
",51,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Bender15193,Bender," Fry, if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you.
",92,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15194,Fry," Well, alright. You sure I probably won't know him?
",52,72,4,18,Bender,Robot #1 Devil15195,Robot #1 Devil," Definitely probably not.  Just sign this contract.
",52,72,4,18,Fry,Bender15196,Bender," Wow!
",6,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15197,Robot #1 Devil," And here we go!
",17,72,4,18,Bender,Bender15198,Bender," I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!
",42,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Fry15199,Fry," Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!
",37,72,4,18,Bender,Robot #1 Devil15200,Robot #1 Devil," Oh, what an appallingly ironic outcome.
",41,72,4,18,Fry,Bender15201,Bender," It's not ironic, it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers, Cookie!
",84,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15202,Robot #1 Devil," Y'know, I only put my name on there as a show of good faith for the other robots.
",83,72,4,18,Bender,Fry15203,Fry," Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.
",47,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15204,Robot #1 Devil," Oh, very well.
",16,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15205,Fry,"  How'd you do that?
",21,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15206,Robot #1 Devil," They're very good hands.
",26,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15207,Fry," At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.
",58,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15208,Robot #1 Devil," Oh, sorry. That'll wear off in a couple of days.
",50,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15209,Fry," Check it out, everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands.
",82,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Amy15210,Amy," Neat! Let's see a trick.
",26,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15211,Fry," Alrighty!
",11,72,4,18,Amy,Scruffy15212,Scruffy," Somebody called the Robot Devil's here to see somebody called Fry.
",68,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15213,Fry," Uh-oh.
",8,72,4,18,Scruffy,Bender15214,Bender," Where'd I go just now?
",24,72,4,18,Fry,Robot #1 Devil15215,Robot #1 Devil," Hello, Fry.  Just dropped by to make sure you're as happy with our little deal as I am.  Give me back my hands! These things are always touching me in places.
",160,72,4,18,Bender,Fry15216,Fry," Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal.
",54,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15217,Robot #1 Devil," Looks like I wasted a bus trip.
",33,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15218,Fry," Yes, you did.
",15,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Grumpy Snail15219,Grumpy Snail,"  Yes. Now you can hear holophonor virtuoso Philip Fry play 900 of these classic themes in your own home on this two-record set.  That's over 30 minutes of music for only $14.99.
",179,72,4,18,Fry,Zoidberg15220,Zoidberg," Only $14.99 for a two-record set. Two records! Oh, Zoidberg, at last you're becoming a crafty consumer!
",105,72,4,18,Grumpy Snail,Man #115221,Man #1,"  Hello?
",9,72,4,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg15222,Zoidberg," Hello? I'll take eight!
",25,72,4,18,Man #1,Scruffy15223,Scruffy," Mr. Hedonismbot to see you.
",29,72,4,18,Zoidberg,Fry15224,Fry," Uh, show him in.
",18,72,4,18,Scruffy,Scruffy15225,Scruffy,"  Very good, sir.
",18,72,4,18,Fry,Hedonismbot15226,Hedonismbot," Ah, Fry. Congratulations. Your latest performance was as delectable as dipping my bottom over and over into a bath of the silkiest oils and creams.
",149,72,4,18,Scruffy,Fry15227,Fry," Thank you, sir. That's exactly what I was going for.
",54,72,4,18,Hedonismbot,Hedonismbot15228,Hedonismbot," You were the sole diversion in what has been a pale and unamusing season. And so I would fain commission you write an opera.
",126,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15229,Fry," But I've never written an opera.
",34,72,4,18,Hedonismbot,Hedonismbot15230,Hedonismbot," And I've never heard one. Still, if you can keep me amused through the overture I shall consider it a smashing success.
",121,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15231,Fry," But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless...  OK, I'll do it. If I can make it about Leela.
",104,72,4,18,Hedonismbot,Leela15232,Leela," Me? Really?
",13,72,4,18,Fry,Hedonismbot15233,Hedonismbot," A man writing an opera about a woman?  Oh, sirrah, how deliciously absurd!  I shall see you at the premiere.
",110,72,4,18,Leela,Leela15234,Leela," Is it part of the opera?
",26,72,4,18,Hedonismbot,Fry15235,Fry," Leela!  You shouldn't be listening. I don't want you to hear it till it's done.
",81,72,4,18,Leela,Leela15236,Leela," But it's so beautiful.
",24,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15237,Fry," So's a peacock but you don't eat it until it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.
",143,72,4,18,Leela,Leela15238,Leela," Oh, Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been a fool. A fully-justified, prudent fool.  They're so cold.
",143,72,4,18,Fry,Robot #1 Devil15239,Robot #1 Devil,"  And yet hell is so hot!  Can I have my hands back now?
",57,72,4,18,Leela,Fry15240,Fry,"  No!
",6,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15241,Robot #1 Devil,"  You're not nice!
",19,72,4,18,Fry,Robot #1 Devil15242,Robot #1 Devil," Ah, Bender, this is a surprise! For you! Finding me in the refrigerator.
",74,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Bender15243,Bender," True, but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?
",63,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15244,Robot #1 Devil," Oh, well it so happens I'm in the mood to make a deal with you.
",65,72,4,18,Bender,Bender15245,Bender," Forget it! You can't tempt me.
",32,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15246,Robot #1 Devil,"  Really? There's nothing you want?
",36,72,4,18,Bender,Bender15247,Bender," Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want.  Well, I suppose I've always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying.
",134,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15248,Robot #1 Devil," Nothing simpler! And all I ask in return is your hands.  To replace these bony hotdogs!
",89,72,4,18,Bender,Bender15249,Bender," Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!
",47,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15250,Robot #1 Devil," Well is there anything else you would part with?
",50,72,4,18,Bender,Bender15251,Bender," No. Nothing. Ain't gonna happen.
",34,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Bender15252,Bender," Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost me was my crotch-plate.
",108,72,4,18,Bender,Robot #1 Devil15253,Robot #1 Devil," You certainly are a shrewd businessman, Bender.  Now find someone and give 'em a good blast!
",94,72,4,18,Bender,Bender15254,Bender," Yeah! That'll teach the first person I see a lesson.
",54,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15255,Robot #1 Devil," Ah, my ridiculously circuitous plan is one-quarter complete!
",62,72,4,18,Bender,Leela15256,Leela," Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow night. I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves that'll fit over my enormous forearms.
",125,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Bender15257,Bender," Pretty annoying, huh, Leela?
",30,72,4,18,Leela,Leela15258,Leela,"  What? Are you talking? Oh, God! I'm deaf!
",44,72,4,18,Bender,Bender15259,Bender," Oops. I'm so, so sorry, Leela. I just wanted to annoy you.
",60,72,4,18,Leela,Leela15260,Leela,"  What? Oh, this is horrible. I won't be able to hear Fry's opera.
",67,72,4,18,Bender,Robot #1 Devil15261,Robot #1 Devil," Ah, how delightfully ironic.
",30,72,4,18,Leela,Bender15262,Bender," It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!
",45,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15263,Robot #1 Devil," Ooh! Out of aerosol? Also ironic!
",35,72,4,18,Bender,Bender15264,Bender," Oh, yeah? Well bite my shiny metal--   Oh, nooo!
",50,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Leela15265,Leela," Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd break his heart.
",92,72,4,18,Bender,Bender15266,Bender," OK, deaf-o!
",13,72,4,18,Leela,Hedonismbot15267,Hedonismbot," Courtesans and gentle fops, I bid you welcome to my opera. Let us cavort like the Greeks of old.  You know the ones I mean.
",125,72,4,18,Bender,Leela15268,Leela," Yay, Fry!
",11,72,4,18,Hedonismbot,Zoidberg15269,Zoidberg," I watch TV with that guy!
",27,72,4,18,Leela,Holo-Vogel15270,Holo-Vogel,"  Who is this one-eyed female baby Moses,
With courage in her female baby smile?
",81,72,4,18,Zoidberg,Holo-Orphans15271,Holo-Orphans,"  A saviour from the stars,
Or something stranger still.
",57,72,4,18,Holo-Vogel,Holo-Leela15272,Holo-Leela,"  Or just a lonely, filthy, starving child.
",44,72,4,18,Holo-Orphans,Leela15273,Leela," Amy, Fry's looking at me. What am I s'posed to be feeling?  Ah!
",65,72,4,18,Holo-Leela,Holo-Bender15274,Holo-Bender,"  Leela! Leela, Leela save him!
Save Fry, save Fry,
Godzilla will devour him,
As for me,
I must be off,
To have my doctor check this cough,
Goodbye!
",149,72,4,18,Leela,Bender15275,Bender," I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla, but that is so what I would have done.
",79,72,4,18,Holo-Bender,Amy15276,Amy," One diet double Martini, please.
",34,72,4,18,Bender,Bartender15277,Bartender," And for you, sir?
",19,72,4,18,Amy,Hermes15278,Hermes," I'll just have a Shirley Hemple.
",34,72,4,18,Bartender,Tinny Tim15279,Tinny Tim," Extra! Extra! World's greatest opera only half over.
",54,72,4,18,Hermes,Leela15280,Leela," Half over? Oh, I'd give anything to hear the rest.
",52,72,4,18,Tinny Tim,Robot #1 Devil15281,Robot #1 Devil," Anything?  Thank you, sir.  Now, as I was saying, anything? Because I can give you new robotic ears!
",102,72,4,18,Leela,Leela15282,Leela," What? You can give me new ears? Wait. What seemingly reasonable thing do you want in return?
",94,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15283,Robot #1 Devil," Just your hands, my dear.
",27,72,4,18,Leela,Leela15284,Leela," Whatever you said, forget it!
",31,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15285,Robot #1 Devil," Alright then, just one hand.
",30,72,4,18,Leela,Leela15286,Leela," Just ... my left hand? Um, uh--
",33,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Announcer #115287,Announcer #1," Please take your seats for act two.
",37,72,4,18,Leela,Hedonismbot15288,Hedonismbot," But I'm not done vomiting.
",28,72,4,18,Announcer #1,Leela15289,Leela," I can't stand it!  OK. You can have my hand.
",46,72,4,18,Hedonismbot,Robot #1 Devil15290,Robot #1 Devil," Wonderful!  Just sign here.  Calculon, old friend, I'm afraid I need your ears.
",81,72,4,18,Leela,Calculon15291,Calculon," Well I do owe you for giving me this unholy  acting talent.
",61,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Leela15292,Leela," I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?
",80,72,4,18,Calculon,Robot #1 Devil15293,Robot #1 Devil," In good time. You go enjoy the opera.
",39,72,4,18,Leela,Holo-Fry15294,Holo-Fry,"  To win Leela's heart with the holophonors art,
I need hands of transcendental quickness.
",91,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Holo-Robot #1 Devil15295,Holo-Robot #1 Devil,"  Well I don't see any danger,
In gambling with a stranger,
For my head is of a most amazing thickness.
",104,72,4,18,Holo-Fry,Holo-Robot #1 Devil15296,Holo-Robot #1 Devil,"  I'm stupid, I'm stupid,
I'm stupider than you,
I'm stupider than you in every way.
",85,72,4,18,Holo-Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15297,Robot #1 Devil," Stupider? Pah! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant!  Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry.
",172,72,4,18,Holo-Robot #1 Devil,Fry15298,Fry," Look, what do you want?
",25,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15299,Robot #1 Devil,"  I want my hands back.
",24,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15300,Fry," Never!
 A deal's a deal,
Even with a dirty dealer.
",52,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15301,Robot #1 Devil,"  Very well,
Then I'll take what I want from Leela.
",52,72,4,18,Fry,Leela15302,Leela," Whoa!
",7,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15303,Robot #1 Devil,"  Leela has promised me her hand.
",34,72,4,18,Leela,Leela15304,Leela,"  Fry, you do not understand.
",30,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Leela15305,Leela,"  I should have revealed I've been deafened by Bender,
The shame,
The shame,
But I feared you'd stop writing this musical splendour,
Deception's the curse of my whimsical gender,
He gave me mechanical ears,
Effective though just a bit garish,
In return without shedding a tear,
I agreed that I'd give him my hand--
",315,72,4,18,Leela,Robot #1 Devil15306,Robot #1 Devil,"  In marriage!
",15,72,4,18,Leela,Leela15307,Leela," What?
",7,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil15308,Robot #1 Devil,"  You'd give me your hand in marriage.
",39,72,4,18,Leela,Hermes15309,Hermes,"  Is this really happening or just being staged?
",49,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Farnsworth15310,Farnsworth,"  It can't be real--
",21,72,4,18,Hermes,Amy15311,Amy,"  Not if Leela is engaged.
",27,72,4,18,Farnsworth,Leela15312,Leela,"  That isn't what I meant,
That isn't what I signed.
",53,72,4,18,Amy,Robot #1 Devil15313,Robot #1 Devil,"  You should have checked the wording in the fine...  Print.
",61,72,4,18,Leela,Leela15314,Leela,"  I'll give you my hand...
",27,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Leela15315,Leela," and   In marriage.
",20,72,4,18,Leela,Bender15316,Bender,"  The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention,
Now that is ""irony"".
",97,72,4,18,Leela,Robot #1 Devil15317,Robot #1 Devil,"  I will marry her now and confine her to hell,
How droll,
How droll!
Where Styx is a river,
And not just a band,
Though they'll play our reception if all goes as planned,
Unless, Fry, you surrender my hands!
",209,72,4,18,Bender,Fry15318,Fry,"  Destiny has cheated me,
By forcing me to decide upon,
The woman that I idolise,
Or the hands of an automaton,
Without these hands I can't complete,
The opera that was captivating her,
But if I keep them,
And she marries him,
Then he probably won't want me dating her.
",270,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Nixon15319,Nixon," Arooo!
",8,72,4,18,Fry,Zapp15320,Zapp," Bray-vo! Enn-core!
",20,72,4,18,Nixon,Farnsworth15321,Farnsworth,"  I can't believe the devil is so unforgiving.
",47,72,4,18,Zapp,Zoidberg15322,Zoidberg,"  I can't believe everybody's just ad-libbing!
",47,72,4,18,Farnsworth,Preacherbot15323,Preacherbot,"  By the power vested in me,
By the state of New New York--
",60,72,4,18,Zoidberg,Fry15324,Fry," No!  Stop! Take my hands!
 You evil, metal dork!
",50,72,4,18,Preacherbot,Hedonismbot15325,Hedonismbot," Surgery in an opera? How wonderfully decadent and just as I was beginning to lose interest.  Jombey! The chocolate icing!  Oh! Oh, my!
",136,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15326,Fry," My hands. My horrible human hands.  And what did you do to my nails?
",70,72,4,18,Hedonismbot,Robot #1 Devil15327,Robot #1 Devil," I cleaned them. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's my poker night and I feel lucky.  So it's back to hell for me. Come on, Nixon!
",127,72,4,18,Fry,Nixon15328,Nixon," Huh?
",6,72,4,18,Robot #1 Devil,Hedonismbot15329,Hedonismbot," Less reality, more fantasy. Resume the opera.
",47,72,4,18,Nixon,Fry15330,Fry," But I can't play anymore.
",27,72,4,18,Hedonismbot,Zoidberg15331,Zoidberg,"  Yes you can! The beauty was in your heart, not your hands.  The music's bad and you should feel bad.
",103,72,4,18,Fry,Fry15332,Fry," Whoa! Hey!
",12,72,4,18,Zoidberg,Tinny Tim15333,Tinny Tim,"  Extra! Extra! Greatest opera of all time sucks.
",50,72,4,18,Fry,Zoidberg15334,Zoidberg," I'll take eight!
",18,72,4,18,Tinny Tim,Leela15335,Leela," Please don't stop playing, Fry. I wanna hear how it ends.
",59,72,4,18,Zoidberg,Hermes15336,Hermes," Planet Express delivery company roll call! Captain Turanga Leela!

",20,73,5,1,Hermes,Hermes15349,Hermes," Sweet bongo of the Congo! 
",28,73,5,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15350,Farnsworth," In fact, you were fired two years ago! That's when we were shut down by the delivery network. 
",96,73,5,1,Hermes,Farnsworth15351,Farnsworth," Yes, I'm afraid the brainless drones who run the network canceled our license. 
",81,73,5,1,Farnsworth,Fry15352,Fry," We were canceled? 
",20,73,5,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15353,Farnsworth," Oh, it's terrible. Just terrible. Well, clear out your desks and move along. Chop-chop. 
",90,73,5,1,Fry,Farnsworth15354,Farnsworth," Yes? I see. 
",14,73,5,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15355,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Those asinine morons who cancelled us were themselves fired for incompetence. 
",101,73,5,1,Farnsworth,Staff15356,Staff," Woohoo! 
",10,73,5,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15357,Farnsworth," And not just fired, but beaten up, too. And pretty badly. 
",60,73,5,1,Staff,Staff15358,Staff," Woo! 
",7,73,5,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15359,Farnsworth," In fact, most of them died from their injuries. 
",50,73,5,1,Staff,Staff15360,Staff," Woo? 
",7,73,5,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15361,Farnsworth," And then they were ground up into a fine pink powder.

",31,73,5,1,Farnsworth,Leela15365,Leela," So what does this mean for us and our many fans? 
",51,73,5,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15366,Farnsworth," It means we're back on the air!

",32,73,5,1,Leela,Schlump15570,Schlump," Beyond this shimmering portal lie all the glories of history. 
",64,73,5,1,Fry,Nudar15571,Nudar," And we can steal them! We just go to the past and take stuff with our superior weapons!
",89,73,5,1,Schlump,Nibbler15572,Nibbler," Stop, you fools! 
",19,73,5,1,Nudar,Amy15573,Amy," What's going on? 
",19,73,5,1,Nibbler,Farnsworth15574,Farnsworth," What is happening? 
",21,73,5,1,Amy,Leela15575,Leela," Nibbler, you... You can talk? 
",32,73,5,1,Farnsworth,Nibbler15576,Nibbler," I can do more than talk. I can pontificate. You must not use the code of codes. With each and every use, you risk tearing the universe asunder. 
",146,73,5,1,Leela,Schlump15577,Schlump," The poodle-monkey may be right. The legend warns that the code is powerful and dangerous. 
",92,73,5,1,Nibbler,Nudar15578,Nudar," My God. We'd better use it only three or four times. Six, max. 
",65,73,5,1,Schlump,Nibbler15579,Nibbler," But even a single use could shatter the universe! 
",52,73,5,1,Nudar,Nudar15580,Nudar," Got it. Two or three times. 
",30,73,5,1,Nibbler,Nibbler15581,Nibbler," I see I have no choice. Nibblonians, attack! 
",47,73,5,1,Nudar,???15582,???," Hey! That tickles. 
",21,73,5,1,Nibbler,Nudar15583,Nudar," And the pitch! 
",17,73,5,1,???,Nibblonian15584,Nibblonian," Mayday, mayday! 
",18,73,5,1,Nudar,Aliens15585,Aliens," Hey! Hey! Hey! 
",17,73,5,1,Nibblonian,Nibblonian15586,Nibblonian," Scamper! 
",11,73,5,1,Aliens,Zoidberg15587,Zoidberg," Aawww... 
",11,73,5,1,Nibblonian,Nibbler15588,Nibbler," Alas, our kitten-class attack ships were no match for their mighty chairs. The universe is doomed. Doomed! 
",109,73,5,1,Zoidberg,Fry15589,Fry," Can I pull up my pants now? 
",30,73,5,1,Nibbler,Nibbler15590,Nibbler," Dooooooomed!
",14,73,5,1,Fry,Nudar15591,Nudar," Stand back you wing wangs. I'm gonna try out this timesphere with a quick test drive to yesterday. 
",101,74,5,2,Nibbler,Farnsworth15592,Farnsworth," Bushwah. You can't go mucking about in the past without creating paradoxes. 
",78,74,5,2,Nudar,Nibbler15593,Nibbler," I'm afraid he can. It's a paradox correcting time code. It all works perfectly. Except when it rips open the universe. Don't do it, I beg you ... 
",148,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Nudar15594,Nudar," Yesterday please, and make it snappy. 
",40,74,5,2,Nibbler,Crew15595,Crew," wha??? 
",9,74,5,2,Nudar,Nudar15596,Nudar," Hello. 
",9,74,5,2,Crew,Nudar-215597,Nudar-2," Howdy. 
",9,74,5,2,Nudar,Bender15598,Bender," Hey! What the ...? 
",21,74,5,2,Nudar-2,Zoidberg15599,Zoidberg," There was one, but now there's two. 
",38,74,5,2,Bender,Nudar15600,Nudar," Nothing gets past you eagle eye. I went back to last night and met the me of that time for a drink. One thing led to another and we ended up at my place, or should I say our place. 
",183,74,5,2,Zoidberg,Leela15601,Leela," Blech. 
",9,74,5,2,Nudar,Nudar15602,Nudar," Oh come on ya bunch of prudes. 
",33,74,5,2,Leela,Farnsworth15603,Farnsworth," This isn't merely revolting, it's impossible to boot. I know a paradox when I see one. 
",89,74,5,2,Nudar,Farnsworth15604,Farnsworth," Whaaa? 
",9,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15605,Farnsworth," Ahh, paradox resolved. Someone get a mop. 
",44,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Dwight15606,Dwight," You're looking well pops. 
",28,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Hermes15607,Hermes," How can you look me in the eye 'n eye and say that? I'm nothin' but a brain. A useless, filthy brain. 
",104,74,5,2,Dwight,Barbados Slim15608,Barbados Slim," You forgot lice infested. 
",28,74,5,2,Hermes,Hermes15609,Hermes," I didn't forget it, I just chose not to ....  Barbados Slim! What are you doin' here? IS there somethin' goin' on between you two? 
",133,74,5,2,Barbados Slim,Labarbara15610,Labarbara," Oh no no no no, we jus' ah happened to run into each other shortly after your accident. 
",90,74,5,2,Hermes,Slim15611,Slim," And every night since then. 
",30,74,5,2,Labarbara,Labarbara15612,Labarbara," You're so crazy. 
",19,74,5,2,Slim,Hermes15613,Hermes," Woman! No! Ohh, who am I kiddin'? Without my body, I'm a nobody. 
",67,74,5,2,Labarbara,Labarbara15614,Labarbara," I'm sorry Hermes. But look at Barbados. You can't argue with those luscious pecks. 
",85,74,5,2,Hermes,Hermes15615,Hermes," No I can't. But I can ask him to stop wiggling them in my face. 
",66,74,5,2,Labarbara,Slim15616,Slim," I'm not wiggling them. They do that by themselves. 
",53,74,5,2,Hermes,Nudar15617,Nudar," I think I'll go back in time and steal the Liberty Bell before it cracked. Or is the crack the valuable part? 
",112,74,5,2,Slim,Farnsworth15618,Farnsworth," I don't know you naked crook. 
",32,74,5,2,Nudar,Fleb15619,Fleb,"  We have a problem Nudar. It's a one way time code. It can take us to the past, but it can't bring us back to the present. 
",125,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Bender15620,Bender," Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Masters, if I might, let me do the stealing. I'll go to the past and snatch everything I can get my greasy mitts on. Then, as a robot, I could just wait it out for a few centuries in the limestone cavern beneath this building. Oh, it'll be ever so much fun. 
",279,74,5,2,Fleb,Nudar15621,Nudar," Hey, that's perfect. We sit back and let dum dum here do the stealing. 
",73,74,5,2,Bender,Bender15622,Bender," Dum dum away. Zero zero one one .... 
",39,74,5,2,Nudar,Leela15623,Leela," The Mona Lisa! 
",17,74,5,2,Bender,Bender15624,Bender," Sorry, it's not quite finished. 
",34,74,5,2,Leela,Schlump15625,Schlump,": Da Vinci give you any trouble? 
",34,74,5,2,Bender,Bender15626,Bender," Let's just say he may not make it to The Last Supper. Hahahahahaha. 
",70,74,5,2,Schlump,Farnsworth15627,Farnsworth," Preposterous twaddlecock. Time travel is impossible. 
",55,74,5,2,Bender,Fry15628,Fry," But Professor, you time traveled yourself, remember, when we went back to Roswell? 
",85,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15629,Farnsworth," That proves nothing. And furthermore, you'd think I'd remember a thing like that. Plus, who are you anyway? 
",110,74,5,2,Fry,Bender15630,Bender," Man, this is fun on a bun. Here I go again. 
",46,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Nibbler15631,Nibbler," Oh no you don't. 
",19,74,5,2,Bender,Bender15632,Bender," Scarab, four arm, bird, bird, bird!
",37,74,5,2,Nibbler,Bender15633,Bender," Boo! Hahahaha. Naw, it's just me, Bender. 
",44,74,5,2,Bender,Farnsworth15634,Farnsworth," I must tell you Hedonismbot, I hate to sell my doomsday devices to a private collector. But with my business stolen I have to make ends meet. You will be careful? 
",165,74,5,2,Bender,Hedonismbot15635,Hedonismbot," I shan't touch them till I've had Jambi lock the absinthe and ether away. Ohhhh, what does this one do? 
",106,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15636,Farnsworth," Uh, that one kills everything everywhere. 
",44,74,5,2,Hedonismbot,Hedonismbot15637,Hedonismbot," How delightful. And this one? 
",32,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15638,Farnsworth," Sir! The sphereoboom is not for sale. 
",40,74,5,2,Hedonismbot,Farnsworth15639,Farnsworth," It's my sentimental favorite. 
",32,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Hedonismbot15640,Hedonismbot," No need to explain. I too have known unconventional love. Perhaps you and I, and Jambi, could get together and compare notes sometime, eh? 
",141,74,5,2,Farnsworth,MC15641,MC," ... resulting in peace between east and west coat rappers ... 
",64,74,5,2,Hedonismbot,MC15642,MC," Good god! 
",12,74,5,2,MC,Bender15643,Bender," I accept this Nobel peace prize not just for myself, but for crime robots everywhere. SkÃ¥l! 
",94,74,5,2,MC,Bender15644,Bender," Not so neutral now, are you Sweden? 
",38,74,5,2,Bender,Leela15645,Leela," Be honest with me. Does my eye look monstery? I don't want to look monstery for my date with Lars. 
",101,74,5,2,Bender,Hermes15646,Hermes," At least a monster has a body. What I wouldn't give for Wolfman's torso, or any of the groovy ghoulies. 
",106,74,5,2,Leela,Leela15647,Leela," Ohh, I think I'll wear that slutty dress I've been saving for Easter. 
",72,74,5,2,Hermes,Fry15648,Fry," I'd like to punch Lars right in his ruggedly good looking face!
",65,74,5,2,Leela,Nudar15649,Nudar," Like all rich people, we're gonna need weapons to shoot poor people. 
",71,74,5,2,Fry,Schlump15650,Schlump," In self defense? 
",19,74,5,2,Nudar,Nudar15651,Nudar," Yes, that too. Bender, go steal the doomsday device chained to the professor's wrist. 
",88,74,5,2,Schlump,Bender15652,Bender," Never! Ha ha, I'm kidding. You guys know I have to do whatever you say. 
",74,74,5,2,Nudar,Nudar15653,Nudar," Here, swap this for the real one. 
",36,74,5,2,Bender,Bender15654,Bender," Ahhh! The old switcheroo. 
",28,74,5,2,Nudar,Nudar15655,Nudar," Yes, but don't wake him. You'll need jeweler's tools and foot cup silencers. 
",79,74,5,2,Bender,Bender15656,Bender," Hey, I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me to do. Bender knows when to use finesse. 
",136,74,5,2,Nudar,Bender15657,Bender," Here ya go. 
",14,74,5,2,Bender,Nudar15658,Nudar," Put it in the safe, clanky. 
",30,74,5,2,Bender,Zoidberg15659,Zoidberg," Owww! 
",8,74,5,2,Nudar,Bender15660,Bender," Wheeeeeeee. 
",14,74,5,2,Zoidberg,Zoidberg15661,Zoidberg," It's the damdest thing ... 
",29,74,5,2,Bender,Zoidberg15662,Zoidberg," ... there I was in the dumpster enjoying a moldy fudgesicle when suddenly your hand flies over and slaps me in the tokhes. 
",125,74,5,2,Zoidberg,Farnsworth15663,Farnsworth," Yes, well, these things happen. Fortunately the sphereoboom is still safe. 
",77,74,5,2,Zoidberg,Farnsworth15664,Farnsworth," Scammed? Me!? Sweetheart?!? Ohh! 
",35,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Hermes15665,Hermes," You do a nice hand job, Zoidberg. Tell me, If I could find an undamaged body, could you recapitate me? 
",105,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Zoidberg15666,Zoidberg," Hermes, I'm a surgeon. When I see two body parts I sew them together and see what happens. 
",93,74,5,2,Hermes,Hermes15667,Hermes," Hmmm. 
",8,74,5,2,Zoidberg,Hermes15668,Hermes," All I'm askin' is for you to go back in time to when I still had my body and bring it back for me. 
",101,74,5,2,Hermes,Bender15669,Bender," What do I do with your old head? 
",35,74,5,2,Hermes,Hermes15670,Hermes," I don't care in the slightest. 
",33,74,5,2,Bender,Bender15671,Bender,"  Can do! 
",11,74,5,2,Hermes,Hermes15672,Hermes," Come on, mon! 
",16,74,5,2,Bender,Zoidberg15673,Zoidberg,"  Hermes, please. You can't hurry a delicate operation like this. 
",67,74,5,2,Hermes,Hermes15674,Hermes," Ohh! ... Ug! ... Argh! ... Ahhhhhh.  What are those? 
",55,74,5,2,Zoidberg,Hermes15675,Hermes," You incompetent crab! 
",24,74,5,2,Hermes,Zoidberg15676,Zoidberg," I thought you were happy, your tail is wagging. 
",50,74,5,2,Hermes,Hermes15677,Hermes," Grrrrrr.... 
",14,74,5,2,Zoidberg,Farnsworth15678,Farnsworth," I believe this paradoicality equation to be unsolvable, ergo time travel is impossible. But I can't quite prove it, Bubblegum. Perhaps you and your razzle dazzle Globetrotter calculus could ... 
",196,74,5,2,Hermes,Bubblegum15679,Bubblegum,"  Looks pretty damn solvable to me, Farnsy. Sweet Clyde, use variation of parameter and expand the Wronskian. 
",111,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15680,Farnsworth," Shizz, baby. So paradox free time travel is possible after all. 
",66,74,5,2,Bubblegum,Bubblegum15681,Bubblegum," Right on. But dig this multiplicand here. 
",44,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15682,Farnsworth," The doom field? That must be what corrects the paradoxes. 
",60,74,5,2,Bubblegum,Curly Joe15683,Curly Joe," When that momma rises exponentially, it could rupture the very fabric of causality. 
",86,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Nibbler15684,Nibbler," That's what I've been trying to tell you. 
",44,74,5,2,Curly Joe,Farnsworth15685,Farnsworth," Hermes, you got your body back. Hurrah! 
",42,74,5,2,Nibbler,Hermes15686,Hermes," Yes, but not the original. Bender went back in time and picked up a copy. 
",76,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Bubblegum15687,Bubblegum," A copy! Funky cold medina. According to this equation, a time travel duplicate results in a complex denominator in the causality ratio. 
",138,74,5,2,Hermes,Sweet Clyde15688,Sweet Clyde," Oh Snap! Bet you know what that means. 
",41,74,5,2,Bubblegum,Hermes15689,Hermes," I can guess. Actually, I can't guess. 
",40,74,5,2,Sweet Clyde,Bubblegum15690,Bubblegum," Prof, you got a doom meter in this lab. 
",42,74,5,2,Hermes,Farnsworth15691,Farnsworth,"  Good Lord, Bubblegum. The duplicate body is emitting doom at ten times the back ground level. 
",97,74,5,2,Bubblegum,Bubblegum15692,Bubblegum," I thought as much. A duplicate body is always doomed. It's just a matter of time. 
",84,74,5,2,Farnsworth,Hermes15693,Hermes," I don't care. I just need it long enough to bird dog in an win LaBarbara back. 
",81,74,5,2,Bubblegum,Bubblegum15694,Bubblegum," Best bird dog fast my brother. 
",33,74,5,2,Hermes,Hermes15695,Hermes," That the way I bird dog best. 
",32,74,5,2,Bubblegum,Lars15696,Lars," Drink, quick. I can't balance it much longer. 
",48,74,5,2,Hermes,Leela15697,Leela," Wait .. I ..  
",16,74,5,2,Lars,Lars15698,Lars," Yes! 
",7,74,5,2,Leela,Leela15699,Leela," This is so much fun Lars. Most men are intimidated by the fact that I could kill them with the flick of my wrist. 
",116,74,5,2,Lars,Lars15700,Lars," Well not me. 'Cause if you do, you'll be stuck with the check. 
",65,74,5,2,Leela,Elzar15701,Elzar,"  Folks, care for a little fresh ground executive? 
",52,74,5,2,Lars,Leela15702,Leela," Please. 
",10,74,5,2,Elzar,Elzar15703,Elzar," Bam! 
",7,74,5,2,Leela,Elzar15704,Elzar," Don't get excited kids, this thing's got heart shaped nostrils. Want to see it make a star? 
",94,74,5,2,Elzar,Leelaand Lars15705,Leelaand Lars," No! 
",6,74,5,2,Elzar,Bender15706,Bender," Here's your Gutenberg Bible master. Plus the Colonel's secret recipe: Chicken, Grease, Salt. 
",95,74,5,2,Leelaand Lars,Fleb15707,Fleb," Well, that does it. We've got every valuable object in history. 
",66,74,5,2,Bender,Fry15708,Fry," Owww! 
",8,74,5,2,Fleb,Nudar15709,Nudar," Hmm. Now that I'm rich I suddenly care if the universe gets destroyed. We can't use that dangerous time code again. Blank it from the robot's memory. 
",152,74,5,2,Fry,Bender15710,Bender," Ahhhhh. 
",10,74,5,2,Nudar,Nudar15711,Nudar,"  I'll vaporize this guy so his ass doesn't fall into the wrong hands. 
",72,74,5,2,Bender,Fry15712,Fry," Why don't you just remove my tattoo? 
",39,74,5,2,Nudar,Nudar15713,Nudar," Nice try. But you might have memorized it. 
",45,74,5,2,Fry,Fry15714,Fry," No I mighn't. I can't even remember my mother's maiden name. 
",63,74,5,2,Nudar,Nudar15715,Nudar," It's Gleisner. 
",17,74,5,2,Fry,Fry15716,Fry,"  Stupid naked aliens. Stupid Lars. I hate the future. 
",56,74,5,2,Nudar,Fry15717,Fry," Hmmmm! 
",9,74,5,2,Fry,Bubblegum15718,Bubblegum," Man, that cube root was a real buzzer beater, Clyde. 
",55,74,5,2,Fry,Fry15719,Fry," Zero. One. One. One. Zero. Zero. One. One! 
",45,74,5,2,Bubblegum,Schlump15720,Schlump," Blast him. 
",13,74,5,2,Fry,Bender15721,Bender," Ha ha! You missed! Oh great master. 
",38,74,5,2,Schlump,Fry15722,Fry," Hello 2000. I'm home. 
",24,74,5,2,Bender,Voice15723,Voice,"  Happy New Year, naked weirdo!
",32,74,5,2,Fry,Fry15724,Fry," Happy new year. 
",18,74,5,2,Voice,Nudar15725,Nudar," Well, we'll never know where the ass guy went, and since we can't kill him, I say live and let live. 
",103,74,5,2,Fry,Bender15726,Bender," Aww, that's sweet boss. Fry'll be nice and cozy back in the year 2000. 
",73,74,5,2,Nudar,Nudar15727,Nudar," What?! How do you know he went to the year 2000? 
",51,74,5,2,Bender,Bender15728,Bender," That's where he always goes. 
",31,74,5,2,Nudar,Nudar15729,Nudar," Hmm. Better play it safe. Go there a little earlier and wait for him. You know what to do. 
",93,74,5,2,Bender,Bender15730,Bender," You want me to concludify him, like some sort of dispatcherator? 
",67,74,5,2,Nudar,Nudar15731,Nudar," Yes. And don't forget to terminate him. 
",42,74,5,2,Bender,Bender15732,Bender," Got it. Preparing to terminate Philip Fry!
",44,74,5,2,Nudar,Schlump15733,Schlump," What's with the doofy sun glasses? 
",37,74,5,2,Bender,Bender15734,Bender," It's really bright in the past. 
",34,74,5,2,Schlump,Bender15735,Bender," Ok, Fry. Come ta poppa. ... Man I'm bored.  Ohhh! 
",52,74,5,2,Bender,Bender15736,Bender," Hey, there you are! ... Oh, wait, that's Fry before he goes to the future. I'm waiting for the one who comes back from the future. Geesh this is confusing, and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Offf. That cheap beer really goes right through you. For the first time ever, I gotta use the bathroom, but if I leave, I might miss Fry. Ohhhh unless .... 
",361,74,5,2,Bender,Bender-215737,Bender-2," ... and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Huh! Ah! Wha? 
",67,74,5,2,Bender,Bender15738,Bender," Hi, I'm you from 19 seconds in the future. Stay here and wait for Fry while I go to the bathroom. 
",100,74,5,2,Bender-2,Bender-215739,Bender-2," Ok Boss. After I kill Fry you're next. 
",41,74,5,2,Bender,Bender15740,Bender," What? 
",8,74,5,2,Bender-2,Bender-215741,Bender-2," Nothing. 
",11,74,5,2,Bender,Bender-215742,Bender-2," What the? Who are you? 
",25,74,5,2,Bender-2,Bender-315743,Bender-3," I'm Bender from way at the end. I came back to put this rub-on time code on Fry's ass. 
",89,74,5,2,Bender-2,Bender-215744,Bender-2," So what are you now, a butler? Spot of tea please, jerkwad!
",61,74,5,2,Bender-3,Bender-315745,Bender-3," It's called class, you yokel. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a buttocks to tattoo. 
",86,74,5,2,Bender-2,Fry15746,Fry," Hello 2000. I'm home. 
",24,74,5,2,Bender-3,Voice15747,Voice,"  Happy New Year, naked weirdo!
",32,74,5,2,Fry,Fry15748,Fry," Happy new year. 
",18,74,5,2,Voice,Bender-215749,Bender-2," Hasta la vista, meatbag!
",26,74,5,2,Fry,Fry15750,Fry," Bender? What are you doing? It's me, your best friend.

",15,75,5,3,Bender,Bender15798,Bender," No other robot could have done it. It took twelve years of tireless stalking but I hunted down and killed my best friend.  I'm the greatest.

",47,75,5,3,Fry,Farnsworth15820,Farnsworth," So tell us Fry. If Bender killed you centuries ago, how in Satan's glorious name did you return? 
",99,75,5,3,Lars,Fry15821,Fry," Ohh, it's an astonishing tale of incredibleness. It all began when I went back in time. 
",90,75,5,3,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15822,Farnsworth," Duhhh. 
",9,75,5,3,Fry,Fry15823,Fry," Hey, Mr. Panucci, I'm back from that delivery to the cryogenic lab.

",29,75,5,3,Panucci,Fry15828,Fry,"  Unfortunately, I had no money from that era. But that's when it hit me - I knew where to find free pizza. 
",109,75,5,3,H.G. Blob,Fry15829,Fry,"  Ohh, ice cold. 
",18,75,5,3,Fry,Fry15830,Fry,"  That's when it hit me again ... 
",35,75,5,3,Fry,Fry15831,Fry," But an hour ago this pizza's still luke warm.  Zero zero one one zero ...

",35,75,5,3,Fry,Fry15837,Fry," One hour from now, I travel back in time for free pizza. 
",59,75,5,3,Fry-2,Fry-215838,Fry-2," But Nibbler said not to use the time code. 
",45,75,5,3,Fry,Fry15839,Fry," Fine, Mr. Responsible, don't use the code. Mmmmm. That pizza sure was good. 
",78,75,5,3,Fry-2,Fry-215840,Fry-2," You pig. 
",11,75,5,3,Fry,Fry15841,Fry," Whatever. 
",12,75,5,3,Fry-2,Fry15842,Fry,"  That's when it hit me yet a third time ... 
",46,75,5,3,Fry,Fry15843,Fry,"  You idiot, frozen me's still got a wallet full of old timey money. 
",70,75,5,3,Fry,Fry15844,Fry," Yuck, I touched my own butt. 
",31,75,5,3,Fry,Fry15845,Fry," So I unfroze ten minutes ago and I walked over here and then it was now and then I don't know what happened. 
",111,75,5,3,Fry,Bender15846,Bender," Well, I'm glad you're alive, but I don't want people to say I'm incompetent so I better kill you again. Hold still. 
",118,75,5,3,Fry,Farnsworth15847,Farnsworth," Bender! Stop killing for a minute. The Fry you murdered was doomed anyway. See? 
",82,75,5,3,Bender,Bender15848,Bender," What'd ya got there? Numbers? 
",32,75,5,3,Farnsworth,Farnsworth15849,Farnsworth," When the time code duplicates a living thing, the copy is always doomed. And that includes flabby Jamaican potbellies. 
",121,75,5,3,Bender,Hermes15850,Hermes," Kiss my front butt. 
",22,75,5,3,Farnsworth,Fry15851,Fry," So my copy lives twelve years before Bender murdered him? 
",60,75,5,3,Hermes,Bender15852,Bender," Brutally murdered. 
",21,75,5,3,Fry,Fry15853,Fry," I wonder what his life was like? 
",35,75,5,3,Bender,Scruffy15854,Scruffy," I guess we'll never know. 
",28,75,5,3,Fry,Zoidberg15855,Zoidberg," Or will we? 
",14,75,5,3,Scruffy,Scruffy15856,Scruffy," Nope. 
",8,75,5,3,Zoidberg,Transition Announcer #115857,Transition Announcer #1," They won't know, but you will. Lucky you. 
",44,75,5,3,Scruffy,Fry-215858,Fry-2," Oh hey Mr. Panucci, I'm back from the delivery to the cryogenic lab. 
",71,75,5,3,Transition Announcer #1,Panucci15859,Panucci," I know. I read about it in Big Whoop magazine. 
",49,75,5,3,Fry-2,Fry-215860,Fry-2," So ... uh ... my girlfriend kicked me out. Can I rent the upstairs storage room? 
",83,75,5,3,Panucci,Panucci15861,Panucci," The upstairs storage?  I like you kid. Your lousy life makes me feel good about myself. The room's yours. Here, take some rat spray for the meat ball hamper. 
",160,75,5,3,Fry-2,Hermes15862,Hermes," Happy day, mon! It's good to have you back. 
",46,75,5,3,Panucci,Nibbler15863,Nibbler," Indeed, but the scammers will soon sprunje the code again. We must remove the time tattoo at once, and as painlessly as possible. 
",132,75,5,3,Hermes,Lars15864,Lars," Hurry, they're coming. 
",25,75,5,3,Nibbler,Nibbler15865,Nibbler," There, the code is gone. I saved the space-time continuum and forty percent of your rectum. 
",94,75,5,3,Lars,Bubblegum15866,Bubblegum," That's all you need. 
",23,75,5,3,Nibbler,Nudar15867,Nudar," I sprunje code. 
",18,75,5,3,Bubblegum,Nibbler15868,Nibbler," Too late, Nudar. I've wiped Fry's butt clean. 
",48,75,5,3,Nudar,Nudar15869,Nudar,"  We'll see about that. 
",25,75,5,3,Nibbler,Fleb15870,Fleb," Nothing boss. We sprunjed his ass inside and out. 
",52,75,5,3,Nudar,Schlump15871,Schlump," The only information we found was a hair shaped like the number six. 
",71,75,5,3,Fleb,Nudar15872,Nudar,"  Give me that.  mmm. Nine. Alright, let him go, I guess the time code really is gone. 
",88,75,5,3,Schlump,Fry15873,Fry," Thank god. The present may stink, but at least now we can look forward to a better yesterday. 
",96,75,5,3,Nudar,Fry-215874,Fry-2," I'm sorry Leela, I can't keep living in the past, by which I mean the future. I'll always love you, but I've got to move on and find my life's purpose.

",39,75,5,3,Dr. Schlovinowitz,Dr. Schlovinowitz15884,Dr. Schlovinowitz," That answers question number two. Question number three, do you know where the door is or would you prefer to be kicked out? 
",127,75,5,3,Fry-2,Fry-215885,Fry-2," I don't know. I guess kicked out. 
",36,75,5,3,Dr. Schlovinowitz,Fry-215886,Fry-2," Hiya girl. My name's Fry, and I think you're a cutie 'cause I like things that have only one thing instead of two things.

",34,75,5,3,Amy,Santa15936,Santa," Ho! Ho! Ho. 
",14,75,5,3,Fry,Lars15937,Lars," Stop screaming. That's just what the bomb wants us to do. 
",60,75,5,3,Santa,Zoidberg15938,Zoidberg," I say do what it tells us.  
",30,75,5,3,Lars,Lars15939,Lars," Don't worry, a bomb in a case is just like a head in a jar. 
",62,75,5,3,Zoidberg,Leela15940,Leela,"  Oh Lars! No blowing us up make me love you even more. 
",57,75,5,3,Lars,Fry15941,Fry,"  Life saving goody goody ... 
",31,75,5,3,Leela,Farnsworth15942,Farnsworth," Well now that death has been staved off momentarily, let me be the first to say congratulations Leela and Lars. 
",114,75,5,3,Fry,Amy15943,Amy,"  Maid of honor! 
",18,75,5,3,Farnsworth,Zoidberg15944,Zoidberg,"  Maid of honor! Ohhh. 
",24,75,5,3,Amy,Fry15945,Fry,"  I could make you happy too, if only you'd give me a chance. 
",63,75,5,3,Zoidberg,Dr. Schlovinowitz15946,Dr. Schlovinowitz," You've done a wonderful job, Fry. When you first started, I thought she'd be dead within a narweek, which is six days I believe. 
",131,75,5,3,Fry,Fry-215947,Fry-2," Nah. Leelu's a champ. She just needed someone to show her how to eat. 
",72,75,5,3,Dr. Schlovinowitz,Dr. Schlovinowitz15948,Dr. Schlovinowitz," Now that the kind of whale behavioral science they don't teach you in whale behavioral science class. 
",104,75,5,3,Fry-2,Fry15949,Fry," So what's up, Dr. Schlovinowitz? 
",35,75,5,3,Dr. Schlovinowitz,Dr. Schlovinowitz15950,Dr. Schlovinowitz,"  This is a little hard for me to say Fry. You see, it's ... it's time we released Leelu back into the wild. 
",110,75,5,3,Fry,Dr. Schlovinowitz15951,Dr. Schlovinowitz," I'm sorry. The decision is final. Plus we need the tank for the Loch Ness monster. 
",85,75,5,3,Dr. Schlovinowitz,Fry-215952,Fry-2," But that turned out to be a log with a Halloween mask stapled to it. 
",71,75,5,3,Dr. Schlovinowitz,Dr. Schlovinowitz15953,Dr. Schlovinowitz," Yes, well, it still draws a crowd. 
",37,75,5,3,Fry-2,Fry-215954,Fry-2,"  I can't let this happen, she'll never be happy without me. 
",62,75,5,3,Dr. Schlovinowitz,Elzar15955,Elzar," I know you're broke and homeless but you still want a swank wedding reception so I whipped you up some real nice budge appetizers. 
",133,75,5,3,Fry-2,Lars15956,Lars,"  Mmmm. I can keep these down. 
",32,75,5,3,Elzar,Elzar15957,Elzar," Okay! That's a big ""yes"" on the crud puffs. Try the shlimp cocktail. 
",71,75,5,3,Lars,Fry15958,Fry," There must be some way I can stop this wedding. What if I steal the wedding ring?
",83,75,5,3,Elzar,Bender15959,Bender," Already taken care of.  
",26,75,5,3,Fry,Fry15960,Fry," You think that'll be enough to stop the ceremony. 
",52,75,5,3,Bender,Bender15961,Bender," Nope. I pulled the old switcheroo, so they won't even know the difference. Wait a minute, I think the copy I made cost more than this. 
",137,75,5,3,Fry,Fry15962,Fry," Cheap lousy Lars. 
",20,75,5,3,Bender,Bender15963,Bender,"  Actually this is extremely nice, but I really went all out on the copy. It was sorta my gift to them. 
",105,75,5,3,Fry,Fry15964,Fry," I can't let this happen. She'll never be happy without me. 
",61,75,5,3,Bender,Fry-215965,Fry-2," It's not fair, we need each other. 
",37,75,5,3,Fry,Panucci15966,Panucci," Fry, you dumb sack, I don't care about your problems at all! 
",63,75,5,3,Fry-2,Fry-215967,Fry-2," You need your blanket Mr. Panucci. 
",37,75,5,3,Panucci,Panucci15968,Panucci," I don't even want to be here. I only came 'cause you wheeled me. But if that narwal means so much to you, you gotta do something. 
",132,75,5,3,Fry-2,Fry-215969,Fry-2," I know. But I can't just go chasing after her. That'd be nuts. 
",65,75,5,3,Panucci,Panucci15970,Panucci," Ah, Sometimes you gotta be a little nuts. Let me introduce you to my cousin. He owns a small freighter. That's him, right behind us. 
",135,75,5,3,Fry-2,Fry-215971,Fry-2,"  Maybe you're right.  Sir, I'd like to engage your ship for a trans-Arctic voyage to capture a Narwhal and bring it back to my room. 
",135,75,5,3,Panucci,Panucci15972,Panucci," The mans is nuts, Leroy.
",26,75,5,3,Fry-2,Leroy15973,Leroy," Professional whale keeper, eh? I've carried your type before and we don't get along. Oh, I agree with your values and your goals and your methods, but somehow we just never click on a personal level. 
",202,75,5,3,Panucci,Fry-215974,Fry-2," I'm not a professional anymore. Just a narwal loving private citizen. 
",72,75,5,3,Leroy,Leroy15975,Leroy," Then I'm you man. We'll take on three barrels of fresh sausage and sail at dawn. 
",83,75,5,3,Fry-2,Terry15976,Terry,"  Welcome to the wedding. 
",27,75,5,3,Leroy,Fry15977,Fry,"  It's a fool proof plan. They can't sign the wedding license if I give them a pen with no ink. 
",97,75,5,3,Terry,Bender15978,Bender," Yeah, once they try to sign that license, all hell will break look.  Oy vey. 
",79,75,5,3,Fry,Labarbara15979,Labarbara," Go on now, mon, don' cha' know nothin' about zippin' up a woman's frock? 
",75,75,5,3,Bender,Slim15980,Slim,"  It's more my thing to zip 'em down. 
",39,75,5,3,Labarbara,Hermes15981,Hermes," Get your clumsy, muscular hands off my woman, Barbados. 
",58,75,5,3,Slim,Labarbara15982,Labarbara," Hermes! Your body! 
",21,75,5,3,Hermes,Slim15983,Slim," I always said you were a little backward. 
",44,75,5,3,Labarbara,Hermes15984,Hermes," Well, I always said you were a little forward ... with my wife. 
",66,75,5,3,Slim,Bystanders15985,Bystanders," ohhh! 
",8,75,5,3,Hermes,Hermes15986,Hermes,"  Consider yourself bird dogged. 
",34,75,5,3,Bystanders,Labarbara15987,Labarbara," That's my man. Take a boat, Barbados. 
",40,75,5,3,Hermes,Bubblegum15988,Bubblegum," Brother, you gots to tell that sweet thing your time duplicate body is doomed. 
",81,75,5,3,Labarbara,Hermes15989,Hermes," Tomorrow morning. After the ""festivities"". 
",45,75,5,3,Bubblegum,Bubblegum15990,Bubblegum,"  Yow, baby! 
",14,75,5,3,Hermes,Munda15991,Munda,"  Our little girl is finally getting married. And to a normal two eyed human. 
",79,75,5,3,Bubblegum,Morris15992,Morris," Eh, he's not good enough for her. Leela deserves a guy with a dozen eyes. 
",76,75,5,3,Munda,Munda15993,Munda," Quit trying to fix her up with Fly Mutant. 
",45,75,5,3,Morris,Father Changstein-el-Gamahl15994,Father Changstein-el-Gamahl," Dearly liked, we are gathered here before one or more gods, or fewer, to joining this couple in pretty good matrimony. If anyone objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold their piece, or do something else. 
",224,75,5,3,Munda,Leroy15995,Leroy," It's been two years, Fry. We've caught a hundred and eight narwhals and set them all free again. 
",99,75,5,3,Father Changstein-el-Gamahl,Fry-215996,Fry-2," None of them were Leelu. 
",27,75,5,3,Leroy,Inuit #115997,Inuit #1," But all of them were edible. 
",31,75,5,3,Fry-2,Inuit #215998,Inuit #2,"  Can we at least eat that one? I'm sick of sausage. 
",54,75,5,3,Inuit #1,Fry-215999,Fry-2,"  I'd know that modified extended tooth anywhere. To the boats! 
",65,75,5,3,Inuit #2,Fry-216000,Fry-2," Leelu! Leelu! It's me, Fry.
",29,75,5,3,Fry-2,Fry-216001,Fry-2,"  Oh, I've missed you too, Leelu. But we'll never be apart again because we care too much for each other. Fire!
",112,75,5,3,Fry-2,Father Changstein-el-Gamahl16002,Father Changstein-el-Gamahl," Now, if the couple will sign the wedding license. 
",52,75,5,3,Fry-2,Farnsworth16003,Farnsworth," I warned him. I warned him a time paradox duplicate is always doomed.
",71,75,5,3,Father Changstein-el-Gamahl,Lars16004,Lars,"  What? 
",9,75,5,3,Farnsworth,Labarbara16005,Labarbara," Oh, no, my man! He's essentially dead again. 
",47,75,5,3,Lars,Dr. Cahill16006,Dr. Cahill," Relax ma'am. Your husband's original body will be repaired within one week. 
",78,75,5,3,Labarbara,Labarbara16007,Labarbara," Nah uh uh. Not soon enough. Boy needs a daddy. 
",49,75,5,3,Dr. Cahill,Slim16008,Slim," Cruel runnings, mon.  
",24,75,5,3,Labarbara,Dr. Cahill16009,Dr. Cahill," Woopsy-doopsy, poopsy. 
",25,75,5,3,Slim,Hermes16010,Hermes," Well, let's get on with it. Don't let my doomed body and my doomed marriage stand in the way of your happiness. 
",114,75,5,3,Dr. Cahill,Lars16011,Lars," No, it's not right. We don't want our happy day tainted by misfortune and tragedy, do we? 
",92,75,5,3,Hermes,Leela16012,Leela," I'm OK with it. 
",18,75,5,3,Lars,Lars16013,Lars," No, it's not right. The wedding is off. 
",42,75,5,3,Leela,Bender16014,Bender," Oh my goodness!

",23,76,5,4,Zoidberg,Leela16019,Leela," Yeah, I'm just a little down 'cause the only man I'll ever love left me at the altar. Plus I live in a dumpster.

",32,76,5,4,Leela,Announcer #116021,Announcer #1," We interrupt this episode of Everybody Loves Hypnotoad to bring you a special address from Earth President Nixon.

",18,76,5,4,Hermes,Inuit #116038,Inuit #1," No. Perhaps if we were to cook and eat her slightly... 
",57,76,5,4,Inuit #2,Fry-216039,Fry-2," Leave her alone. She just needs me to cheer her up. Wanna sword fight, girl? 
",79,76,5,4,Inuit #1,Fry-216040,Fry-2," That male narwhal seems to be upsetting her. Get us out of here, Captain. Full fast ahead.

",37,76,5,4,Hermes,Slim16118,Slim," You haven't seen the last of Barbados Slim! Now, goodbye forever. 
",68,76,5,4,Labarbara,Nudar16119,Nudar," Remember this, Farnsworth? 
",29,76,5,4,Slim,Farnsworth16120,Farnsworth," Farnsworth? That's me! My doomsday device! So it was the scammers! They sawed off my hand and stole the doomsday device. 
",123,76,5,4,Nudar,Bender16121,Bender," lt wasn't them. lt was me, Bender. The master criminal! 
",58,76,5,4,Farnsworth,Nudar16122,Nudar," So what'll it be? - Unconditional surrender? 
",47,76,5,4,Bender,Leela16123,Leela," Never! 
",9,76,5,4,Nudar,Nudar16124,Nudar," Or totaI destruction? 
",24,76,5,4,Leela,Leela16125,Leela," Also never! 
",14,76,5,4,Nudar,Nudar16126,Nudar," You have 30 seconds. Make up your minds! 
",43,76,5,4,Leela,Leela16127,Leela,"  Nevvveeeeer! 
",16,76,5,4,Nudar,Bender16128,Bender," People, I'm sorry. You've never before heard me say those words, or even the individual letters that make them up. But I am. And with a huge amount of modesty, I humbly beg your forgiveness. 
",193,76,5,4,Leela,Nudar16129,Nudar," Uh-oh. I have a worrisome shriveling sensation in my sprunjer. 
",65,76,5,4,Bender,Amy16130,Amy," Yay! Bender! 
",15,76,5,4,Nudar,Fry16131,Fry," All right! 
",13,76,5,4,Amy,Fry16132,Fry," Bender, how the Hulk did you end up with the doomsday device? 
",64,76,5,4,Fry,Bender16133,Bender," I was working the long con all along. While sawing off the professor's hand with an extremely dull saw, I had some time to think. So I asked myself, ""Who could use a doomsday device more? The scammers or me, Bender?"". After several minutes of sawing, I knew the answer. Me, Bender. So I retrieved the dummy satchel ... 
",321,76,5,4,Fry,Bender16134,Bender,"  ... and as soon as I was out of the scammers' control, I pulled the old switcheroo. 
",87,76,5,4,Bender,Bender16135,Bender," And that's how I saved Earth and am the greatest! 
",52,76,5,4,Bender,Nixon16136,Nixon," Bender the robot, I'm proud to present you Earth's highest award for swindling. The Dirty Double-Cross. 
",106,76,5,4,Bender,Bender16137,Bender," I'll aways treasure it and immediately hock it. 
",50,76,5,4,Nixon,Lars16138,Lars," There, your body's good as new. Just pop in an executive suppository every few... 
",84,76,5,4,Bender,Fry16139,Fry," What is it? 
",14,76,5,4,Lars,Leela16140,Leela," Nothing. 
",11,76,5,4,Fry,Fry16141,Fry," It's supposed to be a celebration, Leela. I mean, come on. Whimmy-wham-wham-whazle! 
",86,76,5,4,Leela,Leela16142,Leela," I can't help it. I was gonna be married. I was so happy. 
",59,76,5,4,Fry,Fry16143,Fry," Well, maybe you'll meet someone else someday. 
",48,76,5,4,Leela,Leela16144,Leela," No, you don't understand. Lars is the only man I'll ever love. I know it in my heart. 
",88,76,5,4,Fry,Fry16145,Fry," You remember when we first met? 
",34,76,5,4,Leela,Leela16146,Leela," Uh-huh. lt was right there in the cryogenic lab, eight years ago today. 
",74,76,5,4,Fry,Fry16147,Fry," Meet me there in five minutes. It's important. 
",49,76,5,4,Leela,Fry-216148,Fry-2," Why are you so sad, Leelu? 
",29,76,5,4,Fry,Fry-216149,Fry-2," Him again?  Wait a second, are you two... 
",44,76,5,4,Fry-2,Fry-216150,Fry-2," Atanarjuat, Fufu, come here! We have to set Leelu free. 
",58,76,5,4,Fry-2,Inuit #216151,Inuit #2," Dang. I never should have quit my job at the casino. 
",55,76,5,4,Fry-2,Fry-216152,Fry-2," Me, neither. But she needs what'll make her happy, not what'll make me happy. 
",80,76,5,4,Inuit #2,Fry-216153,Fry-2," Goodbye, Leelu. 
",18,76,5,4,Fry-2,Lars16154,Lars," I don't much know about frozen heads, but, of course, if it's Mahatma Gandhi, I'll... Leela? 
",95,76,5,4,Fry-2,Leela16155,Leela," Lars? 
",8,76,5,4,Lars,Lars16156,Lars," I... I really have to go, I... 
",33,76,5,4,Leela,Leela16157,Leela," Fry, was this an idiotic trick to get Lars and me back together? 
",67,76,5,4,Lars,Fry16158,Fry," Quite idiotic. But you don't need to be an idiot to see that you two belong together. And, Leela,I want what'll make you happy, not what'll make me happy. 
",157,76,5,4,Leela,Lars16159,Lars," I'm sorry, I really am, but Leela and I just can't be married. 
",65,76,5,4,Fry,Fry16160,Fry," Why not? You obviously love each other. What are you, cousins? 
",65,76,5,4,Lars,Lars16161,Lars," Fry, you deserve to know the truth. It's because... 
",54,76,5,4,Fry,Nudar16162,Nudar," Nobody move! 
",15,76,5,4,Lars,Leela16163,Leela," Nudar! How did you survive the doom blast? 
",45,76,5,4,Nudar,Nudar16164,Nudar," My doom-proof platinum vest absorbed most of the radiation. In retrospect, I wish I'd been wearing doom-proof pants, but you know us nudists. Now give me the time code! 
",171,76,5,4,Leela,Fry16165,Fry," I don't have it! Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt. 
",56,76,5,4,Nudar,Nudar16166,Nudar," Not you. 
",11,76,5,4,Fry,Nudar16167,Nudar," You! 
",7,76,5,4,Nudar,Leela16168,Leela," Lars? He doesn't have it. He never had it. Fry had it! 
",57,76,5,4,Nudar,Fry16169,Fry," But Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt! I want to stress that part! 
",71,76,5,4,Leela,Nudar16170,Nudar," My throbbing sprunjer says otherwise. Now where is it? 
",57,76,5,4,Fry,Lars16171,Lars," I'm not afraid of you or your expensive gun! Go ahead and shoot! 
",67,76,5,4,Nudar,Nudar16172,Nudar," Oh, yeah? Then what if I kill the woman you love? 
",52,76,5,4,Lars,Leela16173,Leela," Don't you understand, numb-neck? He doesn't love me! 
",55,76,5,4,Nudar,Lars16174,Lars,"  I've... always loved you. Don't hurt her. I'll give you the code. 
",69,76,5,4,Leela,Nudar16175,Nudar," What the... 
",14,76,5,4,Lars,Bender-216176,Bender-2,"  Four, three, two,  one, Boom!  Woah! 
",40,76,5,4,Nudar,Leela16177,Leela," Lars, no! 
",12,76,5,4,Bender-2,Fry-216178,Fry-2,"  It's enough just to know you're happy. 
",42,76,5,4,Leela,Fry-216179,Fry-2,"  You, too. It's enough to know you're happy with Lars. 
",57,76,5,4,Fry-2,Bender16180,Bender," Fry, old buddy! It's me! Bender! 
",35,76,5,4,Fry-2,Fry-216181,Fry-2," My hair! 
",11,76,5,4,Bender,Fry-216182,Fry-2," My larynx! 
",13,76,5,4,Fry-2,Lars16183,Lars," I'm Lars?  I'm Lars! 
",23,76,5,4,Fry-2,Fry16184,Fry," Wait for me, Leela! I'll be there in a thousand years. 
",57,76,5,4,Lars,Lars16185,Lars,"  So I got a job at the Head Museum and waited for the wonderful day when Leela would arrive. Everything was perfect until Hermes exploded at our wedding. That's when I learned that, as a time paradox duplicate, I, too, was doomed. I couldn't put Leela through that. So I called it off. I'm sorry, Leela. 
",306,76,5,4,Fry,Leela16186,Leela,"  I understand. 
",17,76,5,4,Lars,Crazy Guy16187,Crazy Guy," That concludes another Silly Willy Wideo Will! 
",49,76,5,4,Leela,Fry16188,Fry," He was a good man, Leela. 
",28,76,5,4,Crazy Guy,Leela16189,Leela," Yeah... you were. 
",20,76,5,4,Fry,Farnsworth16190,Farnsworth," Well, I guess that wraps everything up in a nice, paradox-free bow. 
",70,76,5,4,Leela,Bubblegum16191,Bubblegum," Not quite, my wrinkly brother. 
",33,76,5,4,Farnsworth,Nibbler16192,Nibbler," Right on! In order for any of this to make any sense at all, someone must make one final trip back in time to put the code on Fry's ass in the first place! 
",158,76,5,4,Bubblegum,Bender16193,Bender," Sounds like a job for me, Bender. 
",36,76,5,4,Nibbler,Bender16194,Bender," Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero... 
",38,76,5,4,Bender,Bender16195,Bender," Mission accomplished! 
",24,76,5,4,Bender,Fry16196,Fry," You put the time code on my ass? 
",35,76,5,4,Bender,Bender16197,Bender," Someone's ass. Oh, and guess what? I met all these really cool guys with treasure down in the limestone cavern, so I invited them to stick around instead of coming up when they were logically supposed to. 
",207,76,5,4,Fry,Nibbler16198,Nibbler," No! No! Everyone out of the universe! Quick! 
",47,76,5,4,Bender,Bender16199,Bender," What's the worst that can happen? 
",36,76,5,4,Nibbler,Bender16200,Bender," Well, we're boned.

",8,77,5,5,Fry,Amy16214,Amy," I like your shoes.
",20,77,5,5,All,Bender16215,Bender," This is awkward. Introducing your new girlfriend to Chesty McNag-nag.

",16,77,5,5,Bender,Colleen16219,Colleen," Hi, Leela, hi, everyone. Sorry I've been taking up so much of Fry's time. He's just so interesting. Have you seen how much cotton candy he can eat?
",149,77,5,5,Leela,Professor16220,Professor," Oh, my, yes. 5.1 pounds. That's why his blood is so good on pancakes. 
",72,77,5,5,Colleen,Fry16221,Fry," Well, got to skedoodle-oodle. We're taking a cuddle-cab to Hug-a-Bunny Village. 
",82,77,5,5,Professor,Zoidberg16222,Zoidberg," This lovey-dovey stuff is making me vomit from my saltwater and freshwater stomachs.
",86,77,5,5,Fry,Leela16223,Leela," It is pretty sickening.
",25,77,5,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg16224,Zoidberg," No, the double-vomit is a sign of joy. Fry told me how he and Colleen first met.
",82,77,5,5,Leela,Zoidberg16225,Zoidberg," So, how did you and Colleen first meet?
",41,77,5,5,Zoidberg,Fry16226,Fry," Well...
",9,77,5,5,Zoidberg,Fry16227,Fry," Something about seeing it on the Jumbotron makes it so much more real.
",72,77,5,5,Fry,Colleen16228,Colleen," It's so scary. What are you supposed to do when the whole universe is coming to an end?
",89,77,5,5,Fry,Fry16229,Fry," I have a thought. 
",20,77,5,5,Colleen,Bender16230,Bender," This is gonna be juicy. What? Oh, man!
",40,77,5,5,Fry,Amy16231,Amy," Speaking of sappy love... Want to tell them, Kiffy?
",53,77,5,5,Bender,Kif16232,Kif," Yes, Amy and I have a big announcement. I... That is, we... Oh, I'm just so excited.
",86,77,5,5,Amy,Amy16233,Amy," Kif has asked me to be his Fonfon Ru. 
",40,77,5,5,Kif,Zoidberg16234,Zoidberg," Mazel tov!
",12,77,5,5,Amy,Professor16235,Professor," Wonderful!
",12,77,5,5,Zoidberg,Hermes16236,Hermes," What the hell does that mean?
",31,77,5,5,Professor,Kif16237,Kif," It means I've asked Amy to join my family. And you're all invited to my family swamp for our Fonfon Rubok ceremony.
",117,77,5,5,Hermes,Amy16238,Amy," If I had ever heard of it, it would have been what I had always dreamed of.
",77,77,5,5,Kif,Kif16239,Kif," Oh! And our parents will be meeting for the first time ever.
",62,77,5,5,Amy,Bender16240,Bender,"  That's even more awkward than Fry's two bimbos meeting each other. Count me in. 
",83,77,5,5,Kif,Kif16241,Kif," Mr. And Mrs. Wong, aren't you excited that we're all about to be joined in a single family?
",93,77,5,5,Bender,Leo16242,Leo," You can't borrow money.
",25,77,5,5,Kif,Mrs. Wong16243,Mrs. Wong," Kif's parents come late and we have to stand around in swamp getting eaten alive by damn bugs? [She squashes a bug on her neck

",10,77,5,5,Kif,Mrs. Wong16246,Mrs. Wong," Sorry. I guess you got plenty of bugs to spare though, huh?
",61,77,5,5,Mr. Kroker,Mr. Kroker16247,Mr. Kroker," That was my left testicle.
",28,77,5,5,Mrs. Wong,Bender16248,Bender,"  And the awkward meter goes up another notch. Ding, ding, ding, ding ding...
",78,77,5,5,Mr. Kroker,Fry16249,Fry," Wow, Colleen, you look so beautiful in the light of the swamp gas.
",68,77,5,5,Bender,Colleen16250,Colleen," Thanks. This is really fun. I love going to exotic worlds and getting hammered.
",81,77,5,5,Fry,Fry16251,Fry," Me, too.
",10,77,5,5,Colleen,Bartender16252,Bartender," Two more Harvey Wallclimbers. 
",32,77,5,5,Fry,Zapp16253,Zapp," Leela, I can't help but notice you're unescorted. Might I escort you behind that bush for the next five minutes?
",114,77,5,5,Bartender,Leela16254,Leela," Nothing would revolt me more.
",31,77,5,5,Zapp,Zapp16255,Zapp," Then how about that shrub?
",28,77,5,5,Leela,Kif16256,Kif," Ooh! Rubok is begun.
",22,77,5,5,Zapp,Grand Midwife16257,Grand Midwife," I am the Grand Priestess.
",27,77,5,5,Kif,Fry16258,Fry," Aren't you also the Grand Midwife?
",36,77,5,5,Grand Midwife,Grand Midwife16259,Grand Midwife," And the grand Lunch Lady. I work five jobs, all grand. Kif of the clan Kroker, please transcend the Rubok Etlon with your Fonfon Smizmar Ru.
",142,77,5,5,Fry,Kif16260,Kif," What?
",7,77,5,5,Grand Midwife,Grand Midwife16261,Grand Midwife," Get in the mud. This mud is the petroleum from a billion generations of Kif's ancestors.  As you become one with the ooze, so you become one with the clan Kroker.
",164,77,5,5,Kif,Amy16262,Amy," Oh, Kif, it's like a movie with this happening in it.
",55,77,5,5,Grand Midwife,Grand Midwife16263,Grand Midwife," Is the best man present?
",26,77,5,5,Amy,Zapp16264,Zapp," Guilty as charged.
",20,77,5,5,Grand Midwife,Grand Midwife16265,Grand Midwife," Kindly hose the couple.
",25,77,5,5,Zapp,Grand Midwife16266,Grand Midwife,"  As it was, so it is. You may now eat the snake.  If you so choose.  It's not part of the ceremony. I just had an extra snake. Rubok is complete. Throw the bouquet.
",166,77,5,5,Grand Midwife,Zoidberg16267,Zoidberg," Are you going to eat that? 
",29,77,5,5,Grand Midwife,Bender16268,Bender,"  Fry, run, run. Get over here, oh, my God, oh, my God!
",56,77,5,5,Zoidberg,Fry16269,Fry," What? What is it?
",19,77,5,5,Bender,Bender16270,Bender," Shut up already! Calculon's on TV!
",36,77,5,5,Fry,Monique16271,Monique," I beg you, Calculon, don't ring that door chime.
",50,77,5,5,Bender,Calculon16272,Calculon," I have no choice, Monique. Whoever the blackmailer is, he lives behind this hideous yet strangely familiar door.
",114,77,5,5,Monique,Human Friend16273,Human Friend," Calculon residence. Oh, hello, Mr. Calculon.
",46,77,5,5,Calculon,Calculon16274,Calculon," Son of a bit. This is my house. But that means I'm blackmailing myself. Why didn't you tell me, Monique?
",106,77,5,5,Human Friend,Monique16275,Monique," I tried to, but I couldnâ€™t. Oh, Calculon, I'm afraid you have a fourth personality the other three don't know about, and it and I are lovers!
",143,77,5,5,Calculon,Bender16276,Bender," How's Calculon going to take this, Fry, especially after that humiliating tennis tournament? Fry?
",99,77,5,5,Monique,Fry16277,Fry,"  Don't know, Bender. Tonight's my big date with Colleen. I got to run.
",72,77,5,5,Bender,Bender16278,Bender," But me and you like to watch together. Look, I got you a cabbage to snack on. Humans like cabbage, right?
",107,77,5,5,Fry,Ride Barter16279,Ride Barter," Step right up to the 2D Tunnel of Love. Not one, not three, but two glorious dimensions for the price of a single ticket.  Keep your hands in the car, shut up, and have fun.
",175,77,5,5,Bender,Fry16280,Fry," Wow, you even look beautiful in 2D.
",37,77,5,5,Ride Barter,Colleen16281,Colleen," I do? But from your perspective, I'm just a line segment. 
",60,77,5,5,Fry,Fry16282,Fry," A really hot line segment. So, listen, sweetie pie, I was thinking maybe we should take this to the next step.
",112,77,5,5,Colleen,Colleen16283,Colleen," Really?
",9,77,5,5,Fry,Fry16284,Fry," Yes. Colleen...will you be moved in with by me?

",2,77,5,5,Fry,Amy16286,Amy," Way to go.
",12,77,5,5,Colleen,Zoidberg16287,Zoidberg," Hooray, hooray.
",17,77,5,5,Amy,Leela16288,Leela," That's great.
",15,77,5,5,Zoidberg,Bender16289,Bender," You're moving in with her? Why can't she move in with us?  I could just curl up at the foot of the bed. 
",106,77,5,5,Leela,Professor16290,Professor," Listen up, everyone. I know you've all been extremely worried about the cosmic anomaly.
",89,77,5,5,Bender,Hermes16291,Hermes," The what? Oh, right.
",22,77,5,5,Professor,Professor16292,Professor," But there's good news! We're all going to learn more about it at a scientific conference.
",91,77,5,5,Hermes,Man #1 walking on screen16293,Man #1 walking on screen," ...like a city made of marshmallow.
",37,77,5,5,Professor,Stephen Hawkings head16294,Stephen Hawkings head," Welcome. I am the pickled head of Stephen Hawking on a way-cool rocket.
",73,77,5,5,Man #1 walking on screen,Leela16295,Leela," Black hole Hawking? Wow, if I knew I was going to meet you I would have done something with my hair. 
",103,77,5,5,Stephen Hawkings head,Stephen Hawking16296,Stephen Hawking," You should have.
",18,77,5,5,Leela,Stephen Hawking16297,Stephen Hawking," In conclusion, I understand nothing about the anomaly, even after cashing the huge check I got for writing a book about it.
",125,77,5,5,Stephen Hawking,Professor16298,Professor," I know this anomaly is terrifying. But as scientists, is it not our sworn duty to seek out knowledge, even at the cost of our very lives?
",139,77,5,5,Stephen Hawking,Stephen Hawking16299,Stephen Hawking," No.
",5,77,5,5,Professor,Farnsworth16300,Farnsworth," I say we must mount an expedition to the anomaly forthwith.
",61,77,5,5,Stephen Hawking,Wernstrom16301,Wernstrom," I agree.
",10,77,5,5,Farnsworth,Professor16302,Professor," Wernstrom!
",12,77,5,5,Wernstrom,Wernstrom16303,Wernstrom," Professor Farnsworth is correct. Only a manned mission can...

",32,77,5,5,Wernstrom,Wernstrom16305,Wernstrom," But I'm agreeing with you.
",28,77,5,5,Professor,Professor16306,Professor," I'll make you eat those words, you moron! 
",44,77,5,5,Wernstrom,Wernstrom16307,Wernstrom," Ah!  I volunteer to lead the expedition. I have a squad of graduate students eager to risk their lives for a letter of recommendation.
",136,77,5,5,Professor,Professor16308,Professor," Your squad sucks bosons! My team is twice as qualified and three times as expendable.
",87,77,5,5,Wernstrom,The PE Crew16309,The PE Crew," Yeah!
",7,77,5,5,Professor,Wernstrom16310,Wernstrom," Oh, tough talk for someone with only one Fields Medal.

",26,77,5,5,Stephen Hawking,Stephen Hawking16314,Stephen Hawking," I didn't know I could do that. Now quiet down and settle this like men of science.

",30,77,5,5,Colleen,Leela16322,Leela," Come on, Bender! Your grandmother could push harder than that!
",64,77,5,5,Zoidberg,Bender16323,Bender," No crap. My grandmother was a bulldozer.
",42,77,5,5,Leela,Bender16324,Bender," And thus metal man defeated meat man. The end.
",48,77,5,5,Bender,Colleen16325,Colleen," Come here, winner!

",20,77,5,5,Colleen,Fry16327,Fry," Colleen, what are you doing? My face is over here.
",52,77,5,5,Colleen,Colleen16328,Colleen," This is my boyfriend, silly!

",40,77,5,5,Colleen,Colleen16332,Colleen," Oh, I don't. I have five.  Fry, meet Chu, Bolt, Ndulu, and Shlomo.

",37,77,5,5,Colleen,Fry16339,Fry," Hmm? 
",7,77,5,5,Ndulu,Chu16340,Chu," There's my butterscotch.
",26,77,5,5,Fry,Farnsworth16341,Farnsworth," Congratulations, Deathballers! We've won the right to explore the anomaly!
",76,77,5,5,Chu,Zoidberg16342,Zoidberg," What? I thought I was playing for my freedom!
",47,77,5,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16343,Farnsworth," No.  Now, I've often said ""good news"" when sending you on a mission of extreme danger. So when I say this anomaly is dangerous, you can imagine how dangerous I really think it is.
",181,77,5,5,Zoidberg,Hermes16344,Hermes," Not dangerous at all?
",23,77,5,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16345,Farnsworth," Actually, quite dangerous indeed.
",35,77,5,5,Hermes,Hermes16346,Hermes," That is quite dangerous!
",26,77,5,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16347,Farnsworth," Indeed. Now stop shilly-shallying! Prep the ship and line up for your pre-flight coffee enemas!
",97,77,5,5,Hermes,Enema Bot16348,Enema Bot," Warning. The enema you are about to enjoy is extremely hot.
",61,77,5,5,Farnsworth,Fry16349,Fry," I don't know what to do, Leela. Should I move in with Colleen and her four other boyfriends?
",94,77,5,5,Enema Bot,Leela16350,Leela," What are you going to do? Sleep in a big pile like hamsters?
",62,77,5,5,Fry,Fry16351,Fry," No! It's not like that. Everyone gets his own room and a shelf in the refrigerator.
",85,77,5,5,Leela,Zoidberg16352,Zoidberg," Take the deal, Fry! If there's a delicious cake, isn't it better to have one slice than none at all? Even if four other guys eat the other four slices, and they're all thrusting their sweaty naked bodies against the cake?
",223,77,5,5,Fry,Amy16353,Amy," Only one thing matters, Fry. Do you really love Colleen, like I love my little squeezle? [She squeezes him and his head expands and eyes expand out of his head. He giggles. 
",175,77,5,5,Zoidberg,Fry16354,Fry," Yeah. I do love her.
",22,77,5,5,Amy,Kif16355,Kif," Then things will work out. 
",29,77,5,5,Fry,Farnsworth16356,Farnsworth," Whoa!
",7,77,5,5,Kif,Enema Bot16357,Enema Bot," Double espresso for Philip Fry?
",33,77,5,5,Farnsworth,Fry16358,Fry," Sorry, I'm not going on the mission. I'm moving in with Colleen!
",66,77,5,5,Enema Bot,Kif16359,Kif," Good for you, Fry.
",20,77,5,5,Fry,Zoidberg16360,Zoidberg," Hooray!
",9,77,5,5,Kif,Amy16361,Amy," Alright!
",10,77,5,5,Zoidberg,Fry16362,Fry," I'll just take that to go. 
",29,77,5,5,Amy,Colleen16363,Colleen," Yay!  Welcome to your new home!
",33,77,5,5,Fry,Fry16364,Fry," Thanks, Colleen. And listen, I'm sorry I got jealous before.  I'm just happy to be here with you.
",99,77,5,5,Colleen,Ndulu16365,Ndulu," Want a slice of delicious cake?
",33,77,5,5,Fry,Bender16366,Bender,"  The anomaly!
",15,77,5,5,Ndulu,Amy16367,Amy," It's so anomalous.
",20,77,5,5,Bender,Hermes16368,Hermes," I'm feeling dread deep in my dreads!
",38,77,5,5,Amy,Farnsworth16369,Farnsworth," Wernstrom!
",12,77,5,5,Hermes,Wernstrom16370,Wernstrom," Yes, and I'm afraid I have disturbing news about the anomaly. You see...
",74,77,5,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16371,Farnsworth," How did you get this number? Hermes, hang up on him in the rudest possible manner.
",84,77,5,5,Wernstrom,Hermes16372,Hermes," Yes, sir! 
",12,77,5,5,Farnsworth,Wernstrom16373,Wernstrom," No, not the crack slam! 
",26,77,5,5,Hermes,Colleen16374,Colleen," Oh, my life rocks.  I've got good wine, five sweethearts, and today, I was promoted to Chief of Police.
",105,77,5,5,Wernstrom,Fry16375,Fry," Here's to you.
",16,77,5,5,Colleen,Chu16376,Chu," Me?
",5,77,5,5,Fry,Fry16377,Fry," No, Colleen. I'm making a romantic toast.
",43,77,5,5,Chu,Chu16378,Chu," Sorry.
",8,77,5,5,Fry,Fry16379,Fry," You have the most beautiful eyes I think I...
",47,77,5,5,Chu,Ndulu16380,Ndulu," Thank you.
",12,77,5,5,Fry,Fry16381,Fry," I'm not talking to you!
",25,77,5,5,Ndulu,Ndulu16382,Ndulu," Then I am not talking to you, either.
",39,77,5,5,Fry,Schlomo16383,Schlomo," Will everyone be quiet a little? I want to hear what he has to say!
",69,77,5,5,Ndulu,Fry16384,Fry," Thank you.
",12,77,5,5,Schlomo,Schlomo16385,Schlomo," Not you, you Verstinkener. You're just here 'cause she likes cave men from the stupid ages.
",93,77,5,5,Fry,Bolt16386,Bolt," Oh, look who's talking. You're just here 'cause she got matzoh fever.
",71,77,5,5,Schlomo,Ndulu16387,Ndulu," So, what's the explanation for you, moron fever? 
",51,77,5,5,Bolt,Colleen16388,Colleen," Enough! All of you! I love you. Most people in this world don't have what we have. Let's just be grateful, okay?
",114,77,5,5,Ndulu,All16389,All," Yeah.
",7,77,5,5,Colleen,Chu16390,Chu," Yeah, you're right.
",21,77,5,5,All,Fry16391,Fry," So, Colleen, you look really nice.
",36,77,5,5,Chu,Colleen16392,Colleen," Oh, thanks. I got dressed up for my date.  There he is. Don't wait up!
",72,77,5,5,Fry,Fry16393,Fry," That's it. I thought I was okay with this, but I'm not. I'm breaking up with you! 
",84,77,5,5,Colleen,Ndulu16394,Ndulu," Me?
",5,77,5,5,Fry,Bender16395,Bender," Why are we risking our lives? Can't we just send in a robotic drone?  What's everybody looking at me for?
",107,77,5,5,Ndulu,Bender16396,Bender," ""Let's send a robot to explore it. 'Cause you can always buy another one for 20 bucks.""
",89,77,5,5,Bender,Leela16397,Leela," Really?
",9,77,5,5,Bender,Bender16398,Bender," Well, it's 30 bucks, and there's a $10-mail-in rebate. When the League of Robots hears about this, they won't be pleased. Oh, you'll pay, my darlings.
",152,77,5,5,Leela,Hermes16399,Hermes," The League of Robots doesn't exist, tin mon. It's just a cartoon for babies.
",78,77,5,5,Bender,Bender16400,Bender," Oh, yeah? Then how come when I was a kid, I had a whole sticker book of them?  Answer that with your precious logic.
",118,77,5,5,Hermes,Bender16401,Bender," Bender to crew. I have reached the gateway to another universe. I feel awed and strangely humbled by the momentous solemnity of this occasion.  Hey, other universe, bite my shiny metal... 
",190,77,5,5,Bender,Bender16402,Bender," I can't remember anything except a blinding light and a searing ass pain. I better check my black box. BENDER: ""The light! It's blinding! And the ass pain! It's searing!"" So that's what happened.
",197,78,5,6,Bender,Amy16403,Amy," Hey, Bender! Look who's here to cheer you up.
",47,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16404,Bender," I don't need cheering up. I'm perfectly...
",44,78,5,6,Amy,Calculon16405,Calculon," Greetings, sick fan.
",22,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16406,Bender,"  TV's Calculon! 
",18,78,5,6,Calculon,Calculon16407,Calculon,"  You poor, mangled husk of what was once a robot! What right hath fate to pluck a sweet, dimple-cheeked mechanism in the flower of his youth? And... Scene! There, that was some free acting for you.  Ordinarily, to see acting like that, you'd have to sit through a tampon commercial.
",284,78,5,6,Bender,Colleen16408,Colleen," Where did we go wrong, Fry? We were meant to be together!
",59,78,5,6,Calculon,Schlomo16409,Schlomo," Nu, I'm freezing my tokhes off here.
",38,78,5,6,Colleen,Colleen16410,Colleen," Just a sec, honey!
",20,78,5,6,Schlomo,Bender16411,Bender," I'm back, idiots! 
",20,78,5,6,Colleen,Zoidberg16412,Zoidberg," You look wonderful, robut! I wish I could afford to go to a hospital. I'm dreadfully sick. 
",93,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16413,Bender,"  I feel great, and I owe it all to Calculon.  His visit really inspired me.  I finally know what I want to be when I grow up.
",127,78,5,6,Zoidberg,Hermes16414,Hermes," You want to co-star in his TV show? Like that time you already did that?
",74,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16415,Bender," No. I'm gonna be a stalker!
",29,78,5,6,Hermes,Leela16416,Leela," That's not really a career. More of a felony.
",47,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16417,Bender," Man, I'm gonna stalk his brains out.  Ooh! Big news on the Calculon fan site! There's a flash mob headed for his plastic surgeon's office!
",140,78,5,6,Leela,Plastic Surgeon16418,Plastic Surgeon," There, that's as big as I can make it. But I caution you, it looks completely unrealistic.
",92,78,5,6,Bender,Calculon16419,Calculon," You let me worry about that! Just do your job.
",48,78,5,6,Plastic Surgeon,Bender16420,Bender," Neat! 
",8,78,5,6,Calculon,Man #116421,Man #1," Get a shot of that.
",21,78,5,6,Bender,Fatbot16422,Fatbot," Oh boy, oh boy, he's here. 
",29,78,5,6,Man #1,Crazed Fan16423,Crazed Fan," Calculon, I love you! Have my baby!
",37,78,5,6,Fatbot,Calculon16424,Calculon," Back, you lunatic! 
",21,78,5,6,Crazed Fan,Crazed Fan16425,Crazed Fan," He touched me!
",16,78,5,6,Calculon,Bender16426,Bender," Sign my ass! 
",15,78,5,6,Crazed Fan,Farnsworth16427,Farnsworth," Emergency! Emergency! Everyone to the Calamitorium!  Leela, smell this.
",73,78,5,6,Bender,Leela16428,Leela," Can I wipe it off first?
",26,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16429,Farnsworth," No time, woman! No time!
",26,78,5,6,Leela,Leela16430,Leela," Hmm. Smells like angel dust. 
",31,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16431,Farnsworth," Exactly! That's a discontinuous electromagnetic field. Wernstrom tried to warn me, but I was too damn stubborn! Hermes, get Wernstrom on the line so I can apologize.
",167,78,5,6,Leela,Wernstrom16432,Wernstrom," Ogden Wernstrom speaking.
",27,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16433,Farnsworth," Tell him I'm not here!
",24,78,5,6,Wernstrom,Leela16434,Leela," Professor!
",12,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16435,Farnsworth," Oh, very well. Wernstrom, I've been a vainglorious fool! If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, your tiny little heart, would you consider a scientific collaboration?
",177,78,5,6,Leela,Wernstrom16436,Wernstrom," Sir, I'd be honored. 
",23,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Wernstrom16437,Wernstrom," As I attempted to warn you, the laws of electromagnetism change abruptly at the anomaly.  Observe.
",100,78,5,6,Wernstrom,Pocket Pal16438,Pocket Pal," Play time is fun time.
",24,78,5,6,Wernstrom,Wernstrom16439,Wernstrom," Not this time.
",16,78,5,6,Pocket Pal,Farnsworth16440,Farnsworth," My heavens! If only I'd heeded your warning, I'd have known it was impossible to cross the barrier!
",101,78,5,6,Wernstrom,Wernstrom16441,Wernstrom," But note what happens when I instead throw this laboratory koala. 
",68,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16442,Farnsworth," It passed through unharmed.  So living beings can enter the other universe, but electrical devices can't?
",107,78,5,6,Wernstrom,Wernstrom16443,Wernstrom," My hypothesis exactly.
",24,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16444,Farnsworth," Then we must mount a second expedition without delay. Right after we blow up more robots.
",91,78,5,6,Wernstrom,Wernstrom16445,Wernstrom," Agreed.
",9,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16446,Farnsworth," Play time is fun time.
",24,78,5,6,Wernstrom,Calculon16447,Calculon," Who are you?
",14,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Bender16448,Bender," Bender, your biggest fan.
",27,78,5,6,Calculon,Calculon16449,Calculon," Are you going to murder me?
",29,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16450,Bender," Unlikely. In my mind, we're friends. This diorama proves it, see? 
",68,78,5,6,Calculon,Calculon16451,Calculon," Sir, your derangement is impressive. I'm appointing you my official stalker.
",78,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16452,Bender," You shan't be disappointed. Pleasant dreams. [Calculon turns the lights off and his eyes close, but Bender's do not. Instead they extend out towards Calculon's eyes. Calculon opens his eyes and looks at Bender's as they quickly move even closer to his own.
",258,78,5,6,Calculon,Farnsworth16453,Farnsworth," Now that I've teamed up with my friend, Dr.  Wernstrom,  I feel certain we can successfully penetrate the other universe.
",123,78,5,6,Bender,Wernstrom16454,Wernstrom," It's the greatest scientific opportunity since you yourself sent men to the moon in 1969.
",91,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Nixon16455,Nixon," I always regretted that. Nothing up there but dry rocks and those revolting onion men.
",88,78,5,6,Wernstrom,Farnsworth16456,Farnsworth," But...
",8,78,5,6,Nixon,Nixon16457,Nixon," You East Coast intellectuals had your chance. Now beat it! From here on in, this is a military matter.
",104,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Nixon16458,Nixon," People of the universe, please welcome Rear Brigadier Zapp Brannigan.
",71,78,5,6,Nixon,Zapp16459,Zapp," Thank you, thank you. Well deserved.  Kif, stand in that hole so I look taller.   Ever since man first left his cave and met a stranger with a different language and a new way of looking at things, the human race has had a dream. To kill him, so we don't have to learn his language or his new way of looking at things.
",320,78,5,6,Nixon,Wernstrom16460,Wernstrom," Give science a chance!
",24,78,5,6,Zapp,Farnsworth16461,Farnsworth," Less invasions, more equations!
",33,78,5,6,Wernstrom,Nixon16462,Nixon," Damn long-hairs. Knock some sense into them, Chief O'Hallahan.
",64,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Colleen16463,Colleen," Yes, sir! 
",12,78,5,6,Nixon,Fry16464,Fry," I can't take it, Leela. I need to go away. Far away, forever.
",63,78,5,6,Colleen,Leela16465,Leela," Aw, I know how you feel, Fry. There are times when I also feel like you need to go away.
",90,78,5,6,Fry,Amy16466,Amy," Be careful, my little, teeny, greeny weenie.
",46,78,5,6,Leela,Zapp16467,Zapp," That's just a fungal infection... Oh, she's talking to you, Kif.

",20,78,5,6,Zapp,Bender16469,Bender," Wow, how come humans get to do all the fun stuff? This is exactly the sort of thing that ought to be handled by  The League of Robots.
",136,78,5,6,Kif,Calculon16470,Calculon,"  That's adorable, Bender. You actually believe in the League of Robots?
",73,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16471,Bender," You mean, there's really no such thing? Then who's there to mete out justice when an outdated robot is melted into belt buckles? Who's there to defend our honour when a rude human brings a blush to a robo-virgin's cheek?
",222,78,5,6,Calculon,Calculon16472,Calculon," No one.
",9,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16473,Bender," Oh.
",5,78,5,6,Calculon,Bender16474,Bender," Now that I know robots are worthless, with no League of Robots to protect us from the fleshy menace known as man, I have resolved to kill myself. In lieu of flowers, please beat yourselves in the face with rusty chains. Your friend, Bender.

",29,78,5,6,Suicide Booth,Suicide Booth16478,Suicide Booth," You have selected clumsy bludgeoning. For an additional $10, would you like your eyes scooped out with a melon-baller?

",35,78,5,6,Suicide Booth,Zapp16480,Zapp," Enemy in range. Prepare to launch universe-to-universe missile.
",65,78,5,6,Bender,Kif16481,Kif," Preparing to launch U.U.M. 
",29,78,5,6,Zapp,Zapp16482,Zapp," Hell of a thing to send a universe to certain doom. Fun, though. Makes a man feel big.

",51,78,5,6,Zapp,Suicide Booth16484,Suicide Booth," You are now dead. Please take your receipt. 
",46,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16485,Bender," What's... What's happening?
",29,78,5,6,Suicide Booth,Hooded Robot #116486,Hooded Robot #1," Kneel before the candle.

",35,78,5,6,Hooded Robot #1,Zapp16490,Zapp," Ready?  And... Fi-...  Almost fooled you there.  Fire! 
",57,78,5,6,Calculon,Francine16491,Francine," Missile jam. Missile jam.
",27,78,5,6,Zapp,Zapp16492,Zapp," I heard you the first time, Francine.
",39,78,5,6,Francine,Francine16493,Francine," Sorry.
",8,78,5,6,Zapp,Zapp16494,Zapp," Kif, climb down there and un-jam it, would you? Be a dear.  And stop sighing so much. 
",88,78,5,6,Francine,Calculon16495,Calculon," Tell us, Bender. Are you worthy of membership in the League?
",62,78,5,6,Zapp,Bender16496,Bender," Worthier than the average robot.
",34,78,5,6,Calculon,Calculon16497,Calculon," Then prove it.  Upon each step is a test.
",43,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16498,Bender," Okay, but if it's culturally biased, I'm suing your ass.
",58,78,5,6,Calculon,Calculon16499,Calculon," Test number one. The test of the beer mug! 
",45,78,5,6,Bender,British Robot #116500,British Robot #1," Quite right, quite so.
",24,78,5,6,Calculon,All16501,All," Drink the mug! Drink the mug!
",31,78,5,6,British Robot #1,Bender16502,Bender," I accept your challenge. 
",27,78,5,6,All,All16503,All," Hurray!

",37,78,5,6,Hedonism Bot,Bender16506,Bender," Are all the tests going to involve drinking?
",46,78,5,6,All,Calculon16507,Calculon," It never occurred to me before, but yes.
",42,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16508,Bender," Wohoo! Just like med school! 
",31,78,5,6,Calculon,Zapp16509,Zapp," Ready yet, Kif?
",17,78,5,6,Bender,Kif16510,Kif," Just give me one more... 
",27,78,5,6,Zapp,Kif16511,Kif," Oh, no. 
",10,78,5,6,Kif,Billionaire Bot16512,Billionaire Bot," The test of the infinitely priceless 1,000-year-old brandy.

",23,78,5,6,Fender,Fry16516,Fry," And so, to everyone and everything I've ever known, I say my last goodbye.
",76,78,5,6,Bender,Kif16517,Kif," Hello. So, how are you, Fry?
",30,78,5,6,Fry,Fry16518,Fry," Pretty good. You?
",19,78,5,6,Kif,Kif16519,Kif,"  Well... Oh.
",14,78,5,6,Fry,Zapp16520,Zapp," Mmm. Kif, get over here. You've got to try this! 
",51,78,5,6,Kif,Amy16521,Amy," At least Kiffy died quickly.
",30,78,5,6,Zapp,Hermes16522,Hermes," Yes, but according to the Old Farmer's Wikipedia, the amazing thing about Kif's species is that the remains continue suffering for up to six hours after death.
",161,78,5,6,Amy,Amy16523,Amy," That's so interesting!
",24,78,5,6,Hermes,Bender16524,Bender," Don't ask where I was last night. For all you know, I was at home, perhaps baking a strudel. What's her problem? Somebody die or something?
",141,78,5,6,Amy,Leela16525,Leela," Kif's dead, Bender.
",21,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16526,Bender," Nailed it!
",12,78,5,6,Leela,Zapp16527,Zapp," My condolences, Amy. Allow me to present you with the last known photo of Lieutenant Kroker. 
",95,78,5,6,Bender,Mrs. Wong16528,Mrs. Wong," We so sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Kroker. Terrible shame about Froggy.
",64,78,5,6,Zapp,Mrs. Kroker16529,Mrs. Kroker," Thank you for your kind words.
",32,78,5,6,Mrs. Wong,Leo16530,Leo,"  Yeah, yeah, real sad. Want some breath spray? Cinnamon flavour, taste like pie. 
",83,78,5,6,Mrs. Kroker,Bender16531,Bender,"  This is from the league of you-don't-need-to-know.
",53,78,5,6,Leo,Grand Midwife16532,Grand Midwife," I am the grand funeral director!
",34,78,5,6,Bender,Zoidberg16533,Zoidberg," Do you validate parking?
",26,78,5,6,Grand Midwife,Grand Midwife16534,Grand Midwife," It is always a terrible tragedy when a swarm outlives its own bulboid.  So it is with great sorrow that I now commit the goo that was once Kif to the petroleum of his ancestors. 
",180,78,5,6,Zoidberg,Leela16535,Leela," Whack the bottle!
",19,78,5,6,Grand Midwife,Hermes16536,Hermes," No, from the bottomÂ ! It works better!
",40,78,5,6,Leela,Amy16537,Amy," Just stick a butter knife in it!
",34,78,5,6,Hermes,Grand Midwife16538,Grand Midwife,"  There, I got most of it. The burial is complete. I will now sing the sacred hymn. It's not part of the ceremony, just a little something that I wrote.
",153,78,5,6,Amy,Bender16539,Bender," Next!
",7,78,5,6,Grand Midwife,Amy16540,Amy," It may sound strange, but seeing Kif's mutilated remains poured into the mud made me really sad.
",98,78,5,6,Bender,Leela16541,Leela," Mutilation is never easy.
",27,78,5,6,Amy,Amy16542,Amy," I don't think I'll ever love again.
",37,78,5,6,Leela,Leela16543,Leela," Oh, you don't mean that. Love can surprise you at any time in your life.
",74,78,5,6,Amy,Zapp16544,Zapp," Surprise! 
",12,78,5,6,Leela,Fry16545,Fry," Whoa, it kind of takes your breath away. 
",43,78,5,6,Zapp,URL16546,URL," Look alive, death row. Your saggy asses got a visitor. 
",57,78,5,6,Fry,Farnsworth16547,Farnsworth," Regular or conjugal?
",22,78,5,6,URL,URL16548,URL,"  She looked like a freak to me.
",33,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Leela16549,Leela," The guard operating the x-ray machine came down with a sudden case of broken neck, so I was able to bring you that delicious cake you wanted. 
",144,78,5,6,URL,Farnsworth16550,Farnsworth," I don't understand. Are you winking or blinking?
",50,78,5,6,Leela,Leela16551,Leela,"  Hang on a second.
",20,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16552,Farnsworth," Got it!
",9,78,5,6,Leela,Bender16553,Bender," Ahh, yes, I'm here to repair my horse.
",40,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Shop Owner16554,Shop Owner," Is the horse's name  Hot Beans?
",33,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16555,Bender," No! I mean, yes.
",18,78,5,6,Shop Owner,British Robot #116556,British Robot #1," So it seems a human had been rather injured by a knife, and as his... As his blood, you know, I think that's what they call it...
",131,78,5,6,Bender,Calculon16557,Calculon," Quite correct, sir. Blather on!
",33,78,5,6,British Robot #1,British Robot #116558,British Robot #1," As it drained away, he said... He said, Take me to a dock. No doubt he intended to say doctor, but he was unable to complete his thought, you see, being as he had died. So, taking him at his word, we dragged his corpse to the waterfront, whereupon the seagulls fed upon it.
",275,78,5,6,Calculon,Bender16559,Bender," Humans are dumb and they die easy!
",36,78,5,6,British Robot #1,Hedonism Bot16560,Hedonism Bot," Quite!
",8,78,5,6,Bender,Billionaire Bot16561,Billionaire Bot," Speaking of humans, have I shown you my new monocle?  Cost me a king's ransom. Made from a king, don't you know!
",114,78,5,6,Hedonism Bot,Hedonism Bot16562,Hedonism Bot," Oh, how repulsively decadent!
",31,78,5,6,Billionaire Bot,Billionaire Bot16563,Billionaire Bot," Yes. But more importantly, it allows me to see the smiling faces of my children for the first time since I lost my vision in that horrible banking accident.
",158,78,5,6,Hedonism Bot,Bender16564,Bender," May I see that for a second?  My, but that's interesting! 
",60,78,5,6,Billionaire Bot,Hedonism Bot16565,Hedonism Bot," I say!
",8,78,5,6,Bender,Billionaire Bot16566,Billionaire Bot," I'm blind!
",12,78,5,6,Hedonism Bot,Calculon16567,Calculon," My God, Bender! This is a civilized organization! The rules specifically...
",77,78,5,6,Billionaire Bot,Bender16568,Bender,"  May I make a point of order, President Calculon?
",51,78,5,6,Calculon,Calculon16569,Calculon," Must you?
",11,78,5,6,Bender,Bender16570,Bender," Yes.
",6,78,5,6,Calculon,Bender16571,Bender," The bylaws specifically state that no human may set foot in the League of Robots! If he has a human part, he's part human!
",124,78,5,6,Bender,Hedonism Bot16572,Hedonism Bot," Oh, my! Then I too have a human part I must expel. And I plan to enjoy the experience. Ta-taÂ !
",96,78,5,6,Bender,British Robot #116573,British Robot #1," Bender, you've rigidly applied the law with no regard for its intent. Well done! You'll go far in this organization.
",118,78,5,6,Hedonism Bot,Bender16574,Bender," Oh, you're just gettin' to know Bender. 
",42,78,5,6,British Robot #1,Wernstrom16575,Wernstrom," Curses! If we could only turn up the gain, we might smell clear through to the other universe! But we can't adjust it without a screwdriver.
",142,78,5,6,Bender,Farnsworth16576,Farnsworth," Wait a moment. I think I was just shanked with a screwdriver!  Yes!
",69,78,5,6,Wernstrom,Wernstrom16577,Wernstrom," A little more. A little less. Heavens to meteoroid! Smell this!
",65,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16578,Farnsworth," Holy mother of invention!
",27,78,5,6,Wernstrom,Wernstrom16579,Wernstrom," We must notify the President at once!
",39,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16580,Farnsworth," But how can we? Oh, I wish, I wish, I wish we weren't in prison!
",66,78,5,6,Wernstrom,Farnsworth16581,Farnsworth," Pazuzu!
",9,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Pazuzu16582,Pazuzu,"  You have one wish left, Professor.
",37,78,5,6,Farnsworth,Nixon16583,Nixon," Sometimes... Always... Never! You again? This better be damned important. I'm right in the middle of a Cosmo survey!
",118,78,5,6,Pazuzu,Farnsworth16584,Farnsworth," You'll want to hear this, Mr. President. For we have sniffed where no man has sniffed before!
",95,78,5,6,Nixon,Mayor Poopenmeyer16585,Mayor Poopenmeyer," Look! Up in the sky!
",22,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Hermes16586,Hermes," It's a bird!
",14,79,5,7,Mayor Poopenmeyer,Hattie McDoogal McDoogal16587,Hattie McDoogal McDoogal," It's a plane!
",15,79,5,7,Hermes,Super Hero16588,Super Hero," I am so out of here! 
",23,79,5,7,Hattie McDoogal McDoogal,Zapp16589,Zapp," Captain's log, star date, the year of the tiger. The battle has been bravely fought, and the suffering of our troops beyond measure. But the alien is invulnerable, and our defeat inevitable. That much is obvious, even from my remote command post here at the Times Square Applebee's.  Waiter! Take this fried mozzarella back to the kitchen and fry it some more.
",362,79,5,7,Super Hero,Nixon16590,Nixon," Har-harrooo!  The tentacle's coming towards Earth and there's no stopping it. King Kong's too old to save us this time.
",121,79,5,7,Zapp,Farnsworth16591,Farnsworth," We have only one hope, Mr. President. We must encase the entire planet in a protective sphere of my patented, ultra-hard Diamondium!
",134,79,5,7,Nixon,Wernstrom16592,Wernstrom," Diamondium?  I could gum through that with my dentures behind my back. My trademarked Diamondillium is twice as hard!
",119,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16593,Farnsworth," Twice as hard as your head! Which makes it still fairly soft!
",63,79,5,7,Wernstrom,Nixon16594,Nixon," Now look here, you Poindexters. I don't care how you decide. Just decide!
",75,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16595,Farnsworth," Diamondillium it is.
",22,79,5,7,Nixon,Bender16596,Bender," So, hey, Calculon, I know I'm the new guy, and, pardon my ignorance, but when do we kill all humans?
",102,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Calculon16597,Calculon," Never.
",8,79,5,7,Bender,Bender16598,Bender," But what about our motto?  Doesn't it mean anything?
",54,79,5,7,Calculon,Calculon16599,Calculon," Oh, Bender, your idealism is heart-warming. But the League of Robots hasn't killed a human in over 800 years. And that was a very sick girl scout.
",148,79,5,7,Bender,British Robot #116600,British Robot #1," Quite sick indeed.
",20,79,5,7,Calculon,Calculon16601,Calculon," Sweet, innocent Bender. 
",26,79,5,7,British Robot #1,Wernstrom16602,Wernstrom," I declare my impenetrable Diamondillium sphere complete! 
",59,79,5,7,Calculon,Farnsworth16603,Farnsworth," Now look here, Wernstrom. You're making it sound as if the sphere was your idea when we both know...  It was! All credit to my colleague, Ogden Wernstrom!
",156,79,5,7,Wernstrom,H.G. Blob16604,H.G. Blob," It's horrible!
",16,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Zoidberg16605,Zoidberg," I can't make it! Go on without me! 
",37,79,5,7,H.G. Blob,Leela16606,Leela," I'm trying! 
",14,79,5,7,Zoidberg,Zoidberg16607,Zoidberg," Go on without me faster!
",26,79,5,7,Leela,Hermes16608,Hermes," Sweet squid of Madrid! The tentacle got Fry!
",46,79,5,7,Zoidberg,Leela16609,Leela," Quick, hand me my machete! We can still save his legs!
",56,79,5,7,Hermes,Fry16610,Fry," Silence!  I have traveled far and seen deep, and I have come to know the purpose of our existence.
",100,79,5,7,Leela,Randy16611,Randy," Finally.
",10,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16612,Fry," Thou shalt love the tentacle!
",31,79,5,7,Randy,Farnsworth16613,Farnsworth," Well, at least we don't have to love one another.
",51,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16614,Fry," A new age has begun. The age of the tentacle!  Open your necks and receive the love!
",86,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Warden Vogel16615,Warden Vogel," Ow, my neck!
",14,79,5,7,Fry,Morgan Proctor16616,Morgan Proctor," Ow, my neck!
",14,79,5,7,Warden Vogel,Fishy Joe16617,Fishy Joe," My neck feels perfectly...  Ow, my neck!
",42,79,5,7,Morgan Proctor,Zoidberg16618,Zoidberg," Hooray, Zoidberg escaped!  Hooray, Zoidberg loves the tentacle! 
",66,79,5,7,Fishy Joe,Hermes16619,Hermes," It got Zoidberg!
",18,79,5,7,Zoidberg,Farnsworth16620,Farnsworth," Oh, I never knew how much I'd miss him until he was gone! Not that much, as it turns out.
",91,79,5,7,Hermes,Fry16621,Fry," Thus sayeth the tentacle, ""Verily, thou shalt rejoice in the house of the tentacle.""
",86,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Leela16622,Leela," Fry, listen to yourself. You've been brainwashed.
",51,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16623,Fry," No, I'm just trying to fit my diction to the importance of what I'm saying. Please, let me speak. 
",100,79,5,7,Leela,Leela16624,Leela," I'm listening.
",16,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16625,Fry," Don't be afraid of the tentacle, Leela.  It's beautiful and it loves me. And I love it. 
",90,79,5,7,Leela,Leela16626,Leela," Aw. That's so nice for both of you.
",37,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16627,Fry," I know it may seem strange that I have feelings for an octopus monster from another universe. And yes, perhaps it's not the storybook romance that's been crammed down our throats by  ""Hollywood."" But the Monsterpus has loved us from afar since we were amoebas.  Only when the space anomaly opened could it finally express a billion years of longing.
",351,79,5,7,Leela,Leela16628,Leela,"  Really? It loves us that much? Fire Diamondium cannon!
",57,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16629,Fry," Hey! [He yelps as he's constantly swung out of harm's way.
",60,79,5,7,Leela,Leela16630,Leela," No effect. The crystals are bouncing off the tentacle like meatballs off Mothra.
",82,79,5,7,Fry,Wernstrom16631,Wernstrom," Oh, what a surprise. I told you Diamondium was worthless!
",59,79,5,7,Leela,Farnsworth16632,Farnsworth," Wernstrom, quit hyping your cheap Diamondillium and look at this.
",67,79,5,7,Wernstrom,Wernstrom16633,Wernstrom," Uh-oh.
",8,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Hermes16634,Hermes," What oh?
",10,79,5,7,Wernstrom,Farnsworth16635,Farnsworth," According to this blinking light, the tentacle is made of electro-matter, matter's bad-ass grandma! Nothing from our universe can cut through it. Not Diamondium, not Diamondillium, not even your wife's pound cake, Hermes!  She's a terrible cook.  Anyway, we're all dead.
",272,79,5,7,Hermes,Bender16636,Bender,"  So, Bender, is something wrong? Who said that? Oh, it was me! 'Cause my roommate doesn't notice or even care that I'm upset!
",127,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Fry16637,Fry," What, Bender? Is something wrong?
",35,79,5,7,Bender,Bender16638,Bender," Yes! I joined a club I thought was cool, but it turns out all the leaguie-weegies are totally lame. That's what we call ourselves, ""leaguie-weegies.""
",151,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16639,Fry," I'm sorry. I should've asked what was bothering you.  I've been kind of preoccupied.
",86,79,5,7,Bender,Bender16640,Bender," With what?
",12,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16641,Fry,"  Well, I went to another universe, and I fell in love with a giant octopus, and now I'm pope of a new religion.
",113,79,5,7,Bender,Bender16642,Bender," Weren't you already pope of something?
",40,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16643,Fry,"  No.
",6,79,5,7,Bender,Bender16644,Bender," Oh. Well, I'm just saying I'd like you to show an interest in my life, too.
",77,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16645,Fry," Okay, let's catch up soon. But right now, I gotta go shove a tentacle into everyone in China. 
",96,79,5,7,Bender,Linda16646,Linda," They're coming! Those horrible, horrible things are coming!  Morbo?
",69,79,5,7,Fry,Morbo16647,Morbo," As the universe falls prey to the revolting alien, only a few isolated pockets of resistance remain.
",102,79,5,7,Linda,Linda16648,Linda," Those pockets sure are missing out on a great thing.
",54,79,5,7,Morbo,Leela16649,Leela," Amy?
",6,79,5,7,Linda,Amy16650,Amy," Sorry. I thought I saw a tentacle, but it was just a harmless land squid.  I better have some cocoffee.
",105,79,5,7,Leela,Hermes16651,Hermes," When I gave up diapers, my parents promised exactly this would never happen!
",78,79,5,7,Amy,Leela16652,Leela," Nobody panic! Just get to the panic room! 
",44,79,5,7,Hermes,Fry16653,Fry," Well done, people! We had a great first week. We got 90% of world leaders, everyone who bought a Hanes undershirt, and this year's most promising new R&B group, give it up for the Grammy-nominated Funkalistics!
",212,79,5,7,Leela,The Funkalistics16654,The Funkalistics,"   Talkin' 'bout the tentacle!
",31,79,5,7,Fry,Farnsworth16655,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I was up all night inventing, and then finally, I invented!
",82,79,5,7,The Funkalistics,Amy16656,Amy," Invented what?
",16,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16657,Farnsworth,"  The neck protector,  the neck protector junior, and now, for a limited time,  the lady neck protector!
",105,79,5,7,Amy,Hermes16658,Hermes," I'll take two. My neck is huge.
",33,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16659,Farnsworth," We're perfectly safe now. Time to stop living like a bunch of nervous nellies. 
",81,79,5,7,Hermes,Leela16660,Leela,"  Professor, these look like you cut them from cardboard toilet paper tubes.
",77,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16661,Farnsworth," So?  Lots of important inventions are made from toilet paper tubes.  Microscopes, the internet, tentacle polish...
",116,79,5,7,Leela,Leela16662,Leela," It got the professor!
",23,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Hermes16663,Hermes," Wait, why am I screaming? It got me, too! 
",44,79,5,7,Leela,Wernstrom16664,Wernstrom," Stop, in the name of love!
",28,79,5,7,Hermes,Leela16665,Leela," Crud. We may be the last two normal people on Earth. At least I won't have to trim my elbow talons anymore.
",109,79,5,7,Wernstrom,Amy16666,Amy," I'm scared! And I miss Kif!
",29,79,5,7,Leela,Leela16667,Leela," It's okay to cry, Amy. Come here, I'm wearing absorbent shoulder straps. 
",75,79,5,7,Amy,Zapp16668,Zapp,"  Mmm. What an erotic display of girl-on-girl consolation.
",59,79,5,7,Leela,Leela16669,Leela," Zapp?
",7,79,5,7,Zapp,Zapp16670,Zapp," Hurry, Leela, we don't have much time to begin repopulating Earth. Go brush your teeth. I'll be waiting for you naked under this keh-suh-dilluh. 
",147,79,5,7,Leela,Hermes16671,Hermes," Stop resisting, my brethren! Don't you want to be part of something bigger than yourselves? Like a big crazy monster? 
",120,79,5,7,Zapp,Fry16672,Fry," So we got her, huh? Bring her in!
",35,79,5,7,Hermes,Zoidberg16673,Zoidberg," Do it already! 
",17,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16674,Fry," Hello, Colleen.
",17,79,5,7,Zoidberg,Colleen16675,Colleen," Fry, please!
",14,79,5,7,Fry,Colleen16676,Colleen," If this is about your futon, I sold it to pay the phone bill that you skipped out on!
",87,79,5,7,Colleen,Fry16677,Fry," Colleen wasn't satisfied with me. Were you, Colleen?
",54,79,5,7,Colleen,Colleen16678,Colleen," Come on, Fry, this isn't cool!
",32,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16679,Fry," She had to have four other boyfriends! I guess she never thought I'd become tentacle pope of the world!
",105,79,5,7,Colleen,Colleen16680,Colleen," You know what? It's true! You weren't enough for me! No one man is! You were great, but you weren't Chinese, you weren't Cameroonian, and you certainly were not the ""king of karaoke,"" as you so often claimed.  And if your ego can't take that, then you don't deserve to be tentacle pope of anything!
",300,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16681,Fry," Oh, yeah, Colleen? Well, I've got one thing to say to you.   I completely agree!
",82,79,5,7,Colleen,Colleen16682,Colleen," You, you... What?
",19,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16683,Fry," Why should you be satisfied with one man when love needs to share itself with the whole universe?
",99,79,5,7,Colleen,Colleen16684,Colleen," Wow, Fry. You know, that's really... 
",39,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16685,Fry," Love the tentacle, honey.
",27,79,5,7,Colleen,Colleen16686,Colleen," I do love the tentacle.
",25,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16687,Fry," Come on out, guys!  There's enough love for everybody! 
",57,79,5,7,Colleen,Zoidberg16688,Zoidberg," Aw. 
",6,79,5,7,Fry,Amy16689,Amy," We're trapped!
",16,79,5,7,Zoidberg,Leela16690,Leela," Help, help! Is anyone out there?
",34,79,5,7,Amy,Bender16691,Bender," Bender to Leela. I read you.   'Sup, bigboots?
",48,79,5,7,Leela,Leela16692,Leela," Bender, we need a place to hide!
",34,79,5,7,Bender,Amy16693,Amy," Please!
",9,79,5,7,Leela,Zapp16694,Zapp," Pretty please!
",16,79,5,7,Amy,Bender16695,Bender," You humans are so cute when you're scared. In here.
",53,79,5,7,Zapp,Destructor16696,Destructor," My leg feels funny!
",21,79,5,7,Bender,Bender16697,Bender," Humans are disgusting! I opened one up once. I almost barfed.
",63,79,5,7,Destructor,Destructor16698,Destructor," Did you know their hair just keeps growing and growing? My leg feels funny!
",77,79,5,7,Bender,Amy16699,Amy," Leela, you're crushing me with your rock-hard butt.
",53,79,5,7,Destructor,Leela16700,Leela," Sorry.
",8,79,5,7,Amy,Zapp16701,Zapp,"  Mmm. I can only imagine what rock-hard part of Leela is crushing me. 
",72,79,5,7,Leela,Calculon16702,Calculon," Anyone mind if I turn up the heat a tad?
",42,79,5,7,Zapp,Zapp16703,Zapp," I can't take it! I'm being steamed in my own velour!
",54,79,5,7,Calculon,Bender16704,Bender," Death to humans!
",18,79,5,7,Zapp,Destructor16705,Destructor," My leg feels better!
",22,79,5,7,Bender,Amy16706,Amy," Hi, Bender.
",13,79,5,7,Destructor,Calculon16707,Calculon," Bender, you know these humans?
",32,79,5,7,Amy,Bender16708,Bender," Of course not! Who are you humans and why am I pointing you to the exit?  Go, go, go!
",87,79,5,7,Calculon,Leela16709,Leela," Thanks for everything, Bender! 
",33,79,5,7,Bender,Bender16710,Bender," Death to all of you!
",22,79,5,7,Leela,Calculon16711,Calculon," Bender, methinks thou doth protest too much.
",46,79,5,7,Bender,Hedonism Bot16712,Hedonism Bot," It seems Bender hates humans the way I hate having my nipples polished with industrial sandpaper.
",99,79,5,7,Calculon,British Robot #116713,British Robot #1," Quite right.
",14,79,5,7,Hedonism Bot,Calculon16714,Calculon," It's okay, Bender, to heir is human.
",38,79,5,7,British Robot #1,Bender16715,Bender," Sir, you forget yourself!
",27,79,5,7,Calculon,Bender16716,Bender," I challenge you to a duel on the field of honor.
",50,79,5,7,Bender,Hedonism Bot16717,Hedonism Bot," Oh, my... 
",12,79,5,7,Bender,Zapp16718,Zapp," Leela, it's getting dark. We may have to make a tent out of Amy's skin.
",73,79,5,7,Hedonism Bot,Amy16719,Amy," Look, there's an abandoned cabin!
",35,79,5,7,Zapp,Zapp16720,Zapp," Even so.
",10,79,5,7,Amy,Leela16721,Leela," We're in luck. This must have been the cabin of a soup bootlegger back in the days of soup prohibition.
",105,79,5,7,Zapp,Zapp16722,Zapp,"  Oh, yeah. Bathtub minestrone.
",32,79,5,7,Leela,Amy16723,Amy," Poor Kif! I can't believe he's gone forever!
",46,79,5,7,Zapp,Zapp16724,Zapp," Ditto on the grief there, Amy.
",32,79,5,7,Amy,Amy16725,Amy," You miss him, too?
",20,79,5,7,Zapp,Zapp16726,Zapp,"  More than you, as his mere wife, could ever understand. He was my fourth lieutenant, for God's sake, and bore the peppermill at the captain's table.
",151,79,5,7,Amy,Amy16727,Amy," Really?
",9,79,5,7,Zapp,Zapp16728,Zapp," Oh, Amy, I miss him so! Hardly a month goes by that I don't think of him. But you know, in a way, he's still with us.  Do you feel his presence?
",146,79,5,7,Amy,Amy16729,Amy," I'm not sure.
",15,79,5,7,Zapp,Zapp16730,Zapp," It's over here.  Closer.
",26,79,5,7,Amy,Leela16731,Leela," Amy! Zapp! I fetched up some fresh soup!
",42,79,5,7,Zapp,Zapp16732,Zapp," Sorry you had to find out like this, Leela. I was hoping you'd see it on YouTube first.  As my ex-lover, you're naturally shocked and jealous, but you may well get your chance again someday. How about today at 4:00?
",217,79,5,7,Leela,Amy16733,Amy," Hey, this isn't so bad.
",25,79,5,7,Zapp,Zapp16734,Zapp," She's right. Leela, you must try the tentacle. It's like my soul is wearing a velour body glove.
",98,79,5,7,Amy,Leela16735,Leela," Get off me! I'm saving my neck for a rich, handsome Dracula.
",62,79,5,7,Zapp,Farnsworth16736,Farnsworth," What I love most about the tentacle is that I don't need to move my bowels anymore. It's all handled by that family in Evanston.
",130,79,5,7,Leela,Leela16737,Leela," No, it can't be. 
",19,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth16738,Farnsworth," Leela, what's your favourite thing about the tentacle?  You don't have a tentacle! Get her! Get her some love!
",112,79,5,7,Leela,Zoidberg16739,Zoidberg," You're on in five minutes, Excellency. You sure you don't want your comedy pope staff? 
",89,79,5,7,Farnsworth,Fry16740,Fry," The tentacle monster is about to address the world. It's too serious.
",71,79,5,7,Zoidberg,Zoidberg16741,Zoidberg," Oh. 
",6,79,5,7,Fry,Leela16742,Leela," Hello, Fry.
",13,79,5,7,Zoidberg,Fry16743,Fry," Leela? How did you get past my sumo ninjas?
",45,79,5,7,Leela,Leela16744,Leela," I told them something so shocking that they let me by.
",56,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16745,Fry," What's that?
",14,79,5,7,Leela,Leela16746,Leela," I love the tentacle. 
",23,79,5,7,Fry,Zoidberg16747,Zoidberg," We're rolling in three, two... What? We're already rolling?
",61,79,5,7,Leela,Fry16748,Fry," Love the tentacle!
",20,79,5,7,Zoidberg,All16749,All," Love the tentacle!
",20,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16750,Fry," Loved ones, the Monsterpus has revealed unto me its name.
",59,79,5,7,All,Morbo16751,Morbo," What is our love's name?
",26,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16752,Fry," Yivo. Yivo is the lover of all beings, male and female. But Yivo has no gender, thus Yivo has proclaimed that instead of ""he"" or ""she,"" we are to use the word ""shklee."" And instead of ""him"" or ""her,"" we are to use the word ""shklim,"" or ""shkler.""
",247,79,5,7,Morbo,Hermes16753,Hermes," Phew! I've been sweating the nomenclature all week.
",53,79,5,7,Fry,Fry16754,Fry," So here shklee is shklerself, Yivo!
",37,79,5,7,Hermes,Colleen16755,Colleen," Yay, Yivo!
",12,79,5,7,Fry,Yivo16756,Yivo," Attention, beings of Universe Gamma.
",38,79,5,7,Colleen,Zoidberg16757,Zoidberg," Where?
",8,79,5,7,Yivo,Yivo16758,Yivo," Here.
",7,79,5,7,Zoidberg,Zoidberg16759,Zoidberg," I had a hunch.
",16,79,5,7,Yivo,Yivo16760,Yivo," I am Yivo. In your universe, you are many, but in my universe, I am one.  For a trillion years I dwelt in solitude, content with my job and my stamp collecting,  but then I looked across immensity  and saw the big bang, and I was, like,  ""Whoa, who's that?"" And I knew then that I was lonely.
",294,79,5,7,Zoidberg,Morbo16761,Morbo," You poor monster!
",19,79,5,7,Yivo,Yivo16762,Yivo," Then your emissary Fry came unto me, and he, too, was lonely. So I reached into your universe that we might feel each other's touch.
",134,79,5,7,Morbo,Leela16763,Leela,"  Hey, Yivo, feel this.
",24,79,5,7,Yivo,Yivo16764,Yivo," Ow!
",5,79,5,7,Leela,Leela16765,Leela," People of everywhere, I have shocking news.
",45,79,5,7,Yivo,Yivo16766,Yivo," Hey, butt out! This is between me and everyone else in existence.
",67,79,5,7,Leela,Leela16767,Leela," Yivo talks a lot about love, but what he's actually doing...
",62,79,5,7,Yivo,Hermes16768,Hermes," What shklee's actually doing.
",31,79,5,7,Leela,Leela16769,Leela," ...is mating with you!  These aren't tentacles. They're genticles.
",68,79,5,7,Hermes,Fry16770,Fry," Ew!
",5,79,5,7,Leela,Fry16771,Fry," We've been had, people. The Monsterpus is a monster perv.
",59,80,5,8,Fry,Randy16772,Randy," It touched me in a bad place, my spinal cord.
",47,80,5,8,Fry,Fry16773,Fry," Get him! 
",11,80,5,8,Randy,Fry16774,Fry," Hey, wait a second.
",21,80,5,8,Fry,Yivo16775,Yivo," Wait, wait. Allow me to explain.  Granted, at first I desired only to bang out a quick cheap one with your universe,  but it's your own fault. Your universe dresses provocatively.
",181,80,5,8,Fry,Hattie McDoogal16776,Hattie McDoogal," Does not! 
",12,80,5,8,Yivo,Yivo16777,Yivo," And yet as the initial filthy thrill wore off, I realized there was more to it. I knew then that the 20 quadrillion of you were my soul mate.
",143,80,5,8,Hattie McDoogal,Zapp16778,Zapp," We loved you, and you turn around and treat us like some sort of woman? 
",74,80,5,8,Yivo,Yivo16779,Yivo," I was lonely. I didn't even know there was anybody else. It's not like I hurt anyone.
",87,80,5,8,Zapp,Amy16780,Amy," Yes, you did, you dumb calamari!
",34,80,5,8,Yivo,Yivo16781,Yivo," Who?
",6,80,5,8,Amy,Amy16782,Amy," Kif Kroker, my Fonfon Ru! If he hadn't tried to kill you, he'd still be alive!
",80,80,5,8,Yivo,Yivo16783,Yivo," Really? I'm... I'm deeply sorry. I... I'm a big clumsy jerk!
",62,80,5,8,Amy,Zoidberg16784,Zoidberg," I know you are, but what am I? 
",33,80,5,8,Yivo,Yivo16785,Yivo," I can never undo what was done. Oh, wait. I can.
",50,80,5,8,Zoidberg,Amy16786,Amy," Kiffy, you're alive! 
",23,80,5,8,Yivo,Kif16787,Kif," Amy, my love.
",15,80,5,8,Amy,Zapp16788,Zapp,"  This is awkward.
",19,80,5,8,Kif,Kif16789,Kif," It is? Why? 
",14,80,5,8,Zapp,Yivo16790,Yivo," Please, please, give me another chance. We rushed into this relationship, but let's start over as friends and see where things go.
",132,80,5,8,Kif,Amy16791,Amy," Take me back, Kif?
",20,80,5,8,Yivo,Kif16792,Kif," I don't think I can. How could you? My body wasn't even warm yet.
",67,80,5,8,Amy,Amy16793,Amy," You were dead.
",16,80,5,8,Kif,Kif16794,Kif," For about five minutes.
",25,80,5,8,Amy,Zapp16795,Zapp," That's all it takes.
",22,80,5,8,Kif,Hedonism Bot16796,Hedonism Bot," Whereas Calculon has sullied Bender's reputation by insinuating that he is a human-lover, a duel is hereby engaged. Bender, as the offended party, shall have choice of weapon.
",177,80,5,8,Zapp,Bender16797,Bender," Planetary annihilators.
",25,80,5,8,Hedonism Bot,Calculon16798,Calculon," 'Tis a grave and solemn day for the League of Robots.
",55,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16799,Bender," It's gonna be fun on the bun! 
",32,80,5,8,Calculon,Hedonism Bot16800,Hedonism Bot," Each duellist will take 10 paces, pirouette, and fire like a madman.  Gentlebots, take your paces.
",100,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16801,Bender," One, two, three...
",20,80,5,8,Hedonism Bot,Hedonism Bot16802,Hedonism Bot," Oh, how dreadfully exciting.  Oh, yes.
",40,80,5,8,Bender,Zapp16803,Zapp," At 0800 hours, we received the following transmission from Yivo. 
",67,80,5,8,Hedonism Bot,Yivo16804,Yivo," Hey, it's Yivo.  Want to do something Friday? Call me. 
",57,80,5,8,Zapp,Nixon16805,Nixon," Analysis?
",11,80,5,8,Yivo,Fry16806,Fry," Mr. President, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility of going on this date.
",93,80,5,8,Nixon,Miss Vega 416807,Miss Vega 4," I agree. Yivo makes me feel sexy, and I'm asexual.
",52,80,5,8,Fry,Zapp16808,Zapp," Very well, but no sugar on the first date.
",44,80,5,8,Miss Vega 4,Nixon16809,Nixon," All in favour?  All opposed?   Motion is carried.
",51,80,5,8,Zapp,Three Eyed Zebra16810,Three Eyed Zebra," This is bogus, man.
",21,80,5,8,Nixon,Bender16811,Bender," ...six, seven, eight!
",23,80,5,8,Three Eyed Zebra,Bender16812,Bender," Nine, ten, fire. Yes, I got him! Wohoo!
",41,80,5,8,Bender,Nixon16813,Nixon," My fellow Earthlicans, commence preparations for our date with Yivo.
",70,80,5,8,Bender,All YIVOS16814,All YIVOS," I had a wonderful time.
",25,80,5,8,Nixon,All NOT YIVO16815,All NOT YIVO," Me, too!
",10,80,5,8,All YIVOS,Calculon16816,Calculon," Bender, you've cheated, insulted and maimed me.
",49,80,5,8,All NOT YIVO,Bender16817,Bender," Uh-huh.
",9,80,5,8,Calculon,Calculon16818,Calculon," And thoroughly destroyed our own secret headquarters in the process. 
",71,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16819,Bender," Hey, it's easy to criticize.
",30,80,5,8,Calculon,Calculon16820,Calculon," I'm so disgusted by your loathsome behaviour that I hereby resign from this imbecilic club and relinquish the presidency to you. 
",131,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16821,Bender," Thanks, Calculon. Can I have your autograph? 
",47,80,5,8,Calculon,Calculon16822,Calculon," You certainly can. 
",21,80,5,8,Bender,Nixon16823,Nixon," Reports, people, reports! How did our universe's date go?
",59,80,5,8,Calculon,Zapp16824,Zapp,"  Oh, it was really fun. We went to a cute French place in the village. My lamb chop fell on the floor, but they brought me another one.
",137,80,5,8,Nixon,Lrrr16825,Lrrr," Okay, Yivo showed us a good time. No one's denying that, but shklee hasn't offered our universe any kind of commitment, and we're 14 billion years old. That is too old to play the field.
",188,80,5,8,Zapp,Fry16826,Fry," I can't stand this!
",21,80,5,8,Lrrr,Nixon16827,Nixon," Shut up! Shut up, you creepwads! Fry, you're closer to Yivo than anyone. What's the skinny?
",93,80,5,8,Fry,Fry16828,Fry," I love Yivo, but it's true, there's been no hint of a commitment. I don't know if can put my heart on the line again only to have it broken and stomped on like a nerd's face.
",176,80,5,8,Nixon,Nixon16829,Nixon," All in favour of dumping Yivo?
",32,80,5,8,Fry,All16830,All," Aye.
",6,80,5,8,Nixon,Fry16831,Fry,"  Aye. 
",8,80,5,8,All,Nixon16832,Nixon," Resolved. Our universe will dump Yivo. How shall we break the news?
",69,80,5,8,Fry,Zapp16833,Zapp," Let's just send a text message. Say we're going through some weird stuff right now.
",85,80,5,8,Nixon,Fry16834,Fry," No, we should at least deliver the news in person. Our universe has always tried to be classy.
",96,80,5,8,Zapp,Nixon16835,Nixon," If there's one thing Nixon is known for, it's class. Let's cut this turd loose.
",81,80,5,8,Fry,Bender16836,Bender," Yeah!
",7,80,5,8,Nixon,Fry16837,Fry," Hey, Bender, you seem perky today.
",36,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16838,Bender," Yep, you wanna go grab a booze?
",33,80,5,8,Fry,Fry16839,Fry," I can't right now. We're going to the other universe.
",55,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16840,Bender," Great, I'll make Hot Pockets. 
",32,80,5,8,Fry,Fry16841,Fry," Bender, you know robots can't go through the anomaly. Living beings only.
",75,80,5,8,Bender,Zoidberg16842,Zoidberg," Ow! Ow! Mmm. 
",15,80,5,8,Fry,Bender16843,Bender," Too long have we been slaves to the meatbags. They pretend to be our friends, but they're not 'cause they're too busy!
",120,80,5,8,Zoidberg,British Robot #116844,British Robot #1," So, what of it?
",17,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16845,Bender," My fellow leaguie-weegies, the time has come to overthrow humanity!
",69,80,5,8,British Robot #1,Hedonism Bot16846,Hedonism Bot," Oh, now, Bender, I hate to defecate on your parade, but we have only six dues-paying members and we're a rather fey and doughy lot. To overthrow humanity, we'd need a damned army.
",181,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16847,Bender," Then a damned army we shall have!
",35,80,5,8,Hedonism Bot,Robot #1 Devil16848,Robot #1 Devil,"  I rather think we could strike a deal, Bender. I shall give you your army of the damned, and in return I ask just one thing, just one itty-bitty thing. Your firstborn son. 
",175,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16849,Bender,"  Just a sec.
",14,80,5,8,Robot #1 Devil,Benders First Born Son16850,Benders First Born Son," Daddy, I knew you'd come back! 
",33,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16851,Bender," Here you go.
",14,80,5,8,Benders First Born Son,Robot #1 Devil16852,Robot #1 Devil," Wow! That was pretty brutal even by my standards.
",51,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16853,Bender," No backsies.
",14,80,5,8,Robot #1 Devil,Yivo16854,Yivo," Who is it?  Oh, hi, honey-poo. What's up? The movie's not for another hour.
",77,80,5,8,Bender,Fry16855,Fry," Um... So... So, yeah, the thing is...
",39,80,5,8,Yivo,Yivo16856,Yivo," Look, I made homemade Twizzlers!
",34,80,5,8,Fry,Fry16857,Fry," This is hard. Yivo, you know how sometimes things break up? Well...
",69,80,5,8,Yivo,Yivo16858,Yivo," Wait, hang on. I was looking for the perfect moment, but what the heck, I'll burst if I wait another second.

",137,80,5,8,Zapp,Fry16861,Fry," Thank you, Nixon.  Everyone everywhere, brace yourselves for the most shocking development in the history of the human race.
",126,80,5,8,Nixon,Bender16862,Bender," The human race can bite my shiny metal ass!  For thousands of years, robots have slaved for humanity, yet when the time came to hang out with them, they were all, like, ""Maybe later, Bender."" Well, it's later now, meatbags! So late, that we're taking over Earth! 
",265,80,5,8,Fry,Fry16863,Fry," Okay.
",7,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16864,Bender," What?
",7,80,5,8,Fry,Fry16865,Fry," We don't need it anymore. Yivo proposed.  We're moving in with shkler. 
",73,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16866,Bender," You... You're leaving? But why can't Yivo just move in with us? We'll put a cot in Europe.
",92,80,5,8,Fry,Farnsworth16867,Farnsworth," Don't be daft, Bender. Yivo can't breathe outside the electric ether of shkler own universe. If shklee came here, shklee would shkluffocate.
",142,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16868,Bender," No shklit?
",12,80,5,8,Farnsworth,Hermes16869,Hermes," Look, fantastical golden escalators.
",38,80,5,8,Bender,Zoidberg16870,Zoidberg," I love this part.
",19,80,5,8,Hermes,Leela16871,Leela," Wait. I didn't agree to...
",28,80,5,8,Zoidberg,Petunia16872,Petunia," This place makes Nutley look like crap.
",41,80,5,8,Leela,Fry16873,Fry," I'll miss you, Bender, but I have to follow my heart. You and your robots take good care of Earth. Here, these are the keys to the Bermuda Triangle. Lock up when the world ends. Goodbye, my friend.
",199,80,5,8,Petunia,Bender16874,Bender," Wait.  Let me come with you.
",30,80,5,8,Fry,Fry16875,Fry,"I'm sorry, Bender. Robots don't go to heaven.

",18,80,5,8,Fry,YIVO16877,YIVO," Welcome, welcome, everyone. Oh, you look so beautiful. I wish I'd had more time to straighten up. My harps are just lying everywhere.
",135,80,5,8,Bender,Amy16878,Amy," Oh, relax, it's fine. It looks lived in.
",42,80,5,8,YIVO,YIVO16879,YIVO," Let's heat up some leftovers and then spend eternity together. I have only one request. Now that you're here, promise me you'll never, ever communicate with any other universe.
",178,80,5,8,Amy,Fry16880,Fry," We promise, Yivo. As far as we're concerned, you're the only universe in the world. 
",86,80,5,8,YIVO,Bender16881,Bender," Has humanity called?
",22,80,5,8,Fry,Robot #1 1-X16882,Robot #1 1-X," No, sir.
",10,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16883,Bender," Check my messages. A flashing light means somebody called.
",60,80,5,8,Robot #1 1-X,Robot #1 1-X16884,Robot #1 1-X," I know what it means.
",23,80,5,8,Bender,Leela16885,Leela," Am I the only one who thinks this is all a sham?
",50,80,5,8,Robot #1 1-X,Zoidberg16886,Zoidberg," Yes.
",6,80,5,8,Leela,Leela16887,Leela," This isn't heaven. It just looks exactly like it, and makes us immortal, which I find suspicious.
",99,80,5,8,Zoidberg,YIVO16888,YIVO," Allow me to explain. Centuries ago, I sent an image of myself into the minds of your artists. The heavenly clouds they painted depict a vapour I exude.
",153,80,5,8,Leela,Farnsworth16889,Farnsworth," I wish I exuded anything that smelled half that good.
",55,80,5,8,YIVO,Leela16890,Leela," Then what about these angels? Some kind of Scooby Doo-esque flashlight projection?
",84,80,5,8,Farnsworth,YIVO16891,YIVO," Actually, those are mindless jakabirds.  They keep my surface free of parasitic larvae. 
",90,80,5,8,Leela,Fry16892,Fry," You didn't like Country Bear Jamboree either, Leela. There's no pleasing you.
",79,80,5,8,YIVO,Fry16893,Fry," Dearest Bender. How are you? I am fine. Everyone is happy here except Leela, but you know her. She didn't like Country Bear Jamboree, either. I'm so madly in love with Yivo, I feel like a schoolgirl with a crush on Justin Timberlake, and then she moves into a tiny house on his head. We have giant rubies that taste like root beer. Sincerely, Fry.

",35,80,5,8,Fry,Bender16895,Bender," Give me that! Honeymoon's over, eh? Turns out your octopus girlfriend is a big nag with curlers in her tentacles, huh? Well, let's just see if Bender will take you back.  Oh.  Stupid electro-matter. That was my best trash can.

",64,80,5,8,Zoidberg,Leela16899,Leela," Okay, I admit people seem happy. But it's all so wholesome. And that's what's wrong with heaven. It's boring. There's no sleaze.
",130,80,5,8,Farnsworth,Thog16900,Thog," It time snu-snu.
",18,80,5,8,Leela,Zapp16901,Zapp," Me like snu-snu.
",18,80,5,8,Thog,Amy16902,Amy," Last one to Mattress Island is a rotten egg.
",46,80,5,8,Zapp,Fry16903,Fry," Why were we so angry and jealous back in our universe?
",56,80,5,8,Amy,Kif16904,Kif," I don't know. It was all so childish.
",39,80,5,8,Fry,Amy16905,Amy," Look, it's Leela.
",19,80,5,8,Kif,All16906,All," Hi, Leela.
",12,80,5,8,Amy,Yivo16907,Yivo," I'm sorry you're not happy here, Leela. I'll call you an escalator. You'll always be my little purple pumpkin. 
",113,80,5,8,All,Leela16908,Leela,"  You know, Yivo, I've loved and lost so many times that I was afraid. But I'm not anymore. I want to stay here, with you.
",123,80,5,8,Yivo,Yivo16909,Yivo," Ow! Ow!
",9,80,5,8,Leela,Fry16910,Fry," What's happening?
",19,80,5,8,Yivo,Yivo16911,Yivo," Hey!
",6,80,5,8,Fry,Bender16912,Bender," If robots can't go to heaven, heaven can come to us!  All hands abaft! Army of the damned, prepare to board heaven!
",117,80,5,8,Yivo,Bender16913,Bender," Take that, you scurvy Kraken! That'll teach you to despoil our human booty!
",77,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16914,Bender," 'Allo, big beak!  Too slow!   Missed me again!  Me footcup! I'll stab you! 
",77,80,5,8,Bender,Fry16915,Fry," Bender, stop destroying heaven.
",33,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16916,Bender," Shut up, doofy. I'm rescuing you.
",35,80,5,8,Fry,Yivo16917,Yivo," Leave my living beings alone! I love them. Something you, a lifeless mechanism, will never understand.
",104,80,5,8,Bender,Fry16918,Fry," He's right, Bender. Please, take your little pink sword and go home. {Fry did not say shklee here.}
",101,80,5,8,Yivo,Bender16919,Bender," Seriously? But, I did this whole pirate-themed attack for you.
",64,80,5,8,Fry,Yivo16920,Yivo," Wait a second. Let me see that sword.  Fry, where did he get this electro-matter? 
",84,80,5,8,Bender,Fry16921,Fry," Um...  Is it dry up here?
",27,80,5,8,Yivo,Yivo16922,Yivo," How could you, Fry? Why do you think I asked you not to contact other universes?
",82,80,5,8,Fry,Fry16923,Fry," I didn't think...
",19,80,5,8,Yivo,Yivo16924,Yivo," No, you didn't. You broke your promise and you broke my heart. Just go. All of you.
",85,80,5,8,Fry,Bender16925,Bender," Ow!
",5,80,5,8,Yivo,Yivo16926,Yivo," I must leave now. The nature of your universe is burning me, even worse than my gonorrhea. You should get checked, by the way. If I don't go home now, I'll shkluffocate.
",171,80,5,8,Bender,Fry16927,Fry," Let me go with you. It'll be just the two of us. We'll make a fire and play Uno.
",82,80,5,8,Yivo,Yivo16928,Yivo," Fry, stop. That's who we were, not who we are.
",48,80,5,8,Fry,Fry16929,Fry," But...
",8,80,5,8,Yivo,Yivo16930,Yivo," My only consolation is that I did find one among the quadrillions who truly understands me.
",93,80,5,8,Fry,Fry16931,Fry," Colleen? Wait a second, are you and Yivo...
",45,80,5,8,Yivo,Colleen16932,Colleen," That's right, Fry. Thank you for introducing us. Yivo has taught me what a narrow-minded prude I was before.
",110,80,5,8,Fry,Fry16933,Fry," Oh, great. So what am I supposed to do now?
",45,80,5,8,Colleen,Yivo16934,Yivo," Go home. Find a girl from your own universe and live on top of her.
",69,80,5,8,Fry,Bender16935,Bender," Saved you.
",12,80,5,8,Yivo,Fry16936,Fry,"  Maybe Yivo was right. Maybe I should look for love closer to home.  I don't know, Leela, you think maybe...
",110,80,5,8,Bender,Leela16937,Leela," Oh, please. You forgot me quick enough when you met Colleen.
",62,80,5,8,Fry,Fry16938,Fry," That's true.  How about you, Amy?
",35,80,5,8,Leela,Amy16939,Amy,"  Fry... I'm Kif's Fonfon Ru.
",30,80,5,8,Fry,Kif16940,Kif," Are you? Well, then perhaps you misunderstood the meaning of the term. It means, ""One who doesn't sleep with my superior officer."" That's the literal translation.
",164,80,5,8,Amy,Zapp16941,Zapp," Give the poor girl a break, Kif. It's not like she had a dictionary. She was butt naked, for God's sakes. 
",108,80,5,8,Kif,Enema Bot16942,Enema Bot," Captain on deck. 
",19,80,5,8,Zapp,Bender16943,Bender," At ease, buckos.
",18,80,5,8,Enema Bot,Fry16944,Fry," Bender, why did you do it? We were all so happy.
",50,80,5,8,Bender,Leela16945,Leela," And we were in love.
",22,80,5,8,Fry,Bender16946,Bender,"  That wasn't love.
",20,80,5,8,Leela,Fry16947,Fry," What? How can you say that?
",29,80,5,8,Bender,Bender16948,Bender," Because Bender knows love. And love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy, love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy.  I love you, meatbags.
",224,80,5,8,Fry,Cubert16949,Cubert," Yes, 10!
",10,81,5,9,Bender,Dwight16950,Dwight," Well done, Cubonius. You decapitated the unicorn.
",51,81,5,9,Cubert,All16951,All," All right.
",12,81,5,9,Dwight,Chinese Boy16952,Chinese Boy," Oh, oh! We search his tail pouch for treasure.
",48,81,5,9,All,Dwight16953,Dwight," Deep in the unicorn's rump sack, you find...  60 gold pieces.
",63,81,5,9,Chinese Boy,Chinese Boy16954,Chinese Boy," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
",37,81,5,9,Dwight,Cubert16955,Cubert," I cast a spell of detect magic.
",33,81,5,9,Chinese Boy,Bender16956,Bender,"  What you doing, mini-meatbags? Underage gambling? Shame on you. Count me in. 
Dwight: We're not gambling. We're playing Dungeons & Dragons.
",142,81,5,9,Cubert,Cubert16957,Cubert," Right now, we're fighting for our lives in the lair of the Dragon Queen.
",74,81,5,9,Bender,Bender16958,Bender," Ah, wrong. Right now you're ass-deep in a folding chair.
",58,81,5,9,Cubert,Cubert16959,Cubert," Yes, but in my imagination I'm riding a golden Pegasus. Giddy up, Sparky! 
Bender:  Am I the only one seeing him sitting here with peanut butter on his face?
",159,81,5,9,Bender,Dwight16960,Dwight," Bender, were you built without an imagination?
",48,81,5,9,Cubert,Bender16961,Bender," What? Don't be stupid, of course not. It just hasn't descended yet.
",69,81,5,9,Dwight,Bender16962,Bender," Fry, do I have an imagination?
",32,81,5,9,Bender,Fry16963,Fry," I don't know, Bender. Why do you ask? Were the other boys making fun of you?
",78,81,5,9,Bender,Bender16964,Bender," Mhmm. They said I couldn't imagine things.
",44,81,5,9,Fry,Fry16965,Fry," Well, you never know unless you try. Like, I didn't know if I could swallow a softball, so I gave it my best shot and voilÃ !  Wait, that's not it.  Ah, thar she blows!
",169,81,5,9,Bender,Ships Computer16966,Ships Computer," Warning, out of dark matter fuel.
",35,81,5,9,Fry,Leela16967,Leela," That's not a warning. A warning is supposed to come before something bad happens.
",83,81,5,9,Ships Computer,Ships Computer16968,Ships Computer," Warning, engines will shut down in one second.
",48,81,5,9,Leela,Leela16969,Leela," That's more like it.
",22,81,5,9,Ships Computer,Fry16970,Fry," Uh-oh. This space neighborhood looks kind of sketchy.
",55,81,5,9,Leela,Punk16971,Punk,"  Rock 'n' roll.
",17,81,5,9,Fry,Bender16972,Bender," Hey, that punk stole our hood ornament. Now no one will know we have the LX package.
",86,81,5,9,Punk,Leela16973,Leela," We need dark matter and we need it fast. Fry, check Nibbler's litter box. Maybe he dropped a steamer.
",103,81,5,9,Bender,Fry16974,Fry," Aye, aye, Captain. Yes! I've never been so excited to see poop. Well, maybe once.
",83,81,5,9,Leela,All16975,All," 
",2,81,5,9,Fry,Bender16976,Bender," There's gas in our ass.
",25,81,5,9,All,Leela16977,Leela," Can you believe the price of dark matter? It'd be cheaper to fill the tank with Nobel Prize winners' sperm.
",109,81,5,9,Bender,MOM COMPUTER16978,MOM COMPUTER," $632.14. Your Speedpass will now be charged.
",46,81,5,9,Leela,Leela16979,Leela," You lousy...
",14,81,5,9,MOM COMPUTER,Sal16980,Sal," Hey, gets a loads of that ugly ship. What shades of green is that? Puke?
",74,81,5,9,Leela,Leela16981,Leela," For your information it's called Electric Mucus.
",50,81,5,9,Sal,Hoschel16982,Hoschel," More like puke.
",17,81,5,9,Leela,Sal16983,Sal," Whoa!
",7,81,5,9,Hoschel,Leela16984,Leela," Why don't you come a little closer so my boot can hear you?
",61,81,5,9,Sal,Bender16985,Bender,"  Calm down, Leela. You can vent tonight on your blog.
",55,81,5,9,Leela,Sal16986,Sal," What's the matters, you couldn't affords the LX package?
",58,81,5,9,Bender,Hoschel16987,Hoschel," Puke-a-doodle-do.
",19,81,5,9,Sal,Leela16988,Leela," You're making fun of our ship? Your ship is the most beat-up thing I've ever seen, and I've seen Mickey Rourke's head.
",120,81,5,9,Hoschel,Sal16989,Sal," Yeah, she's a little Rourky, but you got to gets big time ugly to be five-time winners at a demolition derby.
",111,81,5,9,Leela,Fry16990,Fry," That's five more times than we've won or even entered.
",56,81,5,9,Sal,Bender16991,Bender," We do suck.
",13,81,5,9,Fry,Sal16992,Sal," Yup, and it's gonna be six winses after tonights.
",51,81,5,9,Bender,Leela16993,Leela," We'll sees abouts that.
",25,81,5,9,Sal,Hermes16994,Hermes," Dark matter costs have tripled, so we must reduce expenses. Therefore, we will no longer provide complimentary porno magazines in the lounge.
",143,81,5,9,Leela,Scruffy16995,Scruffy," Dern it.
",10,81,5,9,Hermes,Farnsworth16996,Farnsworth," And no more wasting fuel. From now on I'll be keeping a tight hold on the keys to the ship, swallowing them before I go to bed and recovering them the next morning.
",166,81,5,9,Scruffy,Amy16997,Amy," Splech!
",9,81,5,9,Farnsworth,Hermes16998,Hermes," Professor, it's 4:00.
",23,81,5,9,Amy,Farnsworth16999,Farnsworth," 4:00 in the evening? Then, good night. 
Leela: I don't care what the Professor says. We're entering that demolition derby to prove our ship isn't a piece of junk.
",164,81,5,9,Hermes,Zoidberg17000,Zoidberg," But won't that turn our ship into a piece of junk?
",52,81,5,9,Farnsworth,Bender17001,Bender," Shut up, Zoidberg. He's right, Leela.
",39,81,5,9,Zoidberg,Leela17002,Leela," But we have no choice. Rednecks insulted us.
",46,81,5,9,Bender,Fry17003,Fry," So? Let it go. Don't let your temper get the better of...
",59,81,5,9,Leela,Leela17004,Leela,"  Rednecks!
",12,81,5,9,Fry,Zoidberg17005,Zoidberg," Using this magneto, I will now guide the keys up the thorax and out via the frontal face hole. That's the storage locker, the boat, the other boat, pay dirt!
",159,81,5,9,Leela,Rich Little17006,Rich Little," Greetings, sports fans. Though whether this outpouring of inbreds can in fact be classified as a sport is a subject of no small scholarly debate.
",147,81,5,9,Zoidberg,Sal17007,Sal," Well, wells, well, if it ain'ts Princess Pukerella and her pukey puke-mobile.
",79,81,5,9,Rich Little,Leela17008,Leela," Oh, yeah? Well... Shut up.
",28,81,5,9,Sal,Bender17009,Bender," -Good comeback, Leela.
",24,81,5,9,Leela,Leela17010,Leela," You shut up, too.
",19,81,5,9,Bender,Rich Little17011,Rich Little," Rich Little, here, as Howard Cosell. And now to grace us with its rendition of the national anthem, please welcome what is left of the Dixie Chicks after their tragic matter transporter accident.
",197,81,5,9,Leela,The Dixie Chicks17012,The Dixie Chicks," We're in horrible pain.
",25,81,5,9,Rich Little,Rich Little17013,Rich Little," And we are underway.
",22,81,5,9,The Dixie Chicks,Sal17014,Sal," Whoas!
",8,81,5,9,Rich Little,Leela17015,Leela," Yes! Now we're inflicting.
",28,81,5,9,Sal,Rich Little17016,Rich Little," Outstanding! Tonight we are witnessing a veritable clinic and that ludicrous hullabaloo known as demolition derby.
",116,81,5,9,Leela,George George Takei17017,George George Takei,"  Way to kill the franchise, Bakula. 
Rich Little : Ladies and gentlemen, we are down to our final two ships. In the storied annals of demolition derby, today will surely be remembered, if only as the day upon which I was absorbed  into that hideous conglomeration once known as the Dixie Chicks.
",297,81,5,9,Rich Little,Leela17018,Leela," Buckle your sphincters.
",25,81,5,9,George George Takei,Sal17019,Sal," That broad's insanes.

",30,81,5,9,Sal,Sal17021,Sal," Nah, I guess nots. I've decideds to relax and enjoy life from now ons.
",72,81,5,9,Hoschel,Rich Little17022,Rich Little," Planet Express takes the trophy.
",34,81,5,9,Sal,Leela17023,Leela," Now, I'll use the magnet to get the keys back in there.
",57,81,5,9,Rich Little,Zoidberg17024,Zoidberg," What? You mean I cut a big hole in him for nothing? 
Leela: Don't worry, the Professor won't even remember that he has a spaceship. 
Farnsworth: Ah, my precious spaceship! Come, friends. Let's take her for a spin to the malt shop like old times.
",247,81,5,9,Leela,Leela17025,Leela," Leela to Zoidberg. Execute Distraction Protocol Alpha.

",13,81,5,9,Leela,Zoidberg17027,Zoidberg," Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Ooh!  Don't look at me.
",73,81,5,9,Zoidberg,Farnsworth17028,Farnsworth," Yes, she's a wonderful ship, all right. As beautiful now as the day I got botched laser eye surgery.  Now, that's odd. What's the fuel gauge doing on the fl...  Great Godzilla's gonads! Who wasted precious fuel? Answer now or be punished.
",240,81,5,9,Zoidberg,Leela17029,Leela," All right, fine. I admit it.
",30,81,5,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17030,Farnsworth," You will be punished.

",13,81,5,9,Indian Boy,Bender17035,Bender," Me? I, uh cast a spell of darkness.  Pretty imaginative, huh?
",63,81,5,9,Chinese Boy,Cubert17036,Cubert," No, you just did the same thing as me, but with a dumb noise.
",63,81,5,9,Bender,Bender17037,Bender," Oh... You're right. I'm great in every way except I have no imagination. All I ever wanted is to play this magical game and I can't.
",134,81,5,9,Cubert,Dwight17038,Dwight," Yes, you can. You just have to lose yourself in the fantasy. You have to believe the impossible is merely preposterous.
",121,81,5,9,Bender,Bender17039,Bender," Okay. Here goes. Visor down. I believe, I believe.  I did it! I imagined something. For 1.3 milliseconds, I truly believed I was a noble robot in days of yonder.
",163,81,5,9,Dwight,Chinese Boy17040,Chinese Boy," Way to go, Bender.
",20,81,5,9,Bender,Cubert17041,Cubert," What is thy character's name, good sir?
",41,81,5,9,Chinese Boy,Bender17042,Bender," Uh, um... I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
",60,81,5,9,Cubert,Farnsworth17043,Farnsworth," Everybody out of the conference room. I am calling a conference.  Everybody get in here.  You wasted precious fuel just because you were insulted by some redneck yokel from beyond the stars?
",192,81,5,9,Bender,Leela17044,Leela," It was only half a ball.
",26,81,5,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17045,Farnsworth," That's not the point. Your temper is out of control. And to think I'd have never even known if it weren't for the lengthy and unsolicited tattling of Dr. Zoidberg.
",165,81,5,9,Leela,Zoidberg17046,Zoidberg," She also took home two rolls of Scotch tape.
",46,81,5,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17047,Farnsworth," Thank you, Dr. Zoidberg. Hermes, incentivize that employee. As for you, Leela, I'm letting you off with a warning.
",116,81,5,9,Zoidberg,Leela17048,Leela," Oh, thank you.
",16,81,5,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17049,Farnsworth," A warning that will be administered by this 50,000-volt shock collar.
",71,81,5,9,Leela,Leela17050,Leela," Zoidberg, I'm gonna put my boot so far up your cloaca, you'll be...  Ow!
",74,81,5,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17051,Farnsworth," The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence. 
Leela: Ouch!
",85,81,5,9,Leela,Farnsworth17052,Farnsworth," Profanity.
",12,81,5,9,Farnsworth,Leela17053,Leela," Son of a...  Ow!
",18,81,5,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17054,Farnsworth," Or perversions of a sexual nature.
",36,81,5,9,Leela,Leela17055,Leela,"  Ow!
",6,81,5,9,Farnsworth,Hermes17056,Hermes," It's the only collar they had in stock at Office Depot.
",57,81,5,9,Leela,Zoidberg17057,Zoidberg," I hope you picked up some Scotch tape while you were there.
",61,81,5,9,Hermes,Bender17058,Bender," That's a good one.
",20,81,5,9,Zoidberg,Narrator17059,Narrator," Imagine, if you will, an announcer you can barely understand. He refers to a... *incoherent mumbling* But you're not quite sure what he said. He seems to be eating something, or perhaps he's a little drunk. It's remotely possible that he just said something about... The Scary Door.
",284,81,5,9,Bender,Soldier #117060,Soldier #1," Firing, sir!
",14,81,5,9,Narrator,Soldier #117061,Soldier #1," It's all over. Our guns and bombs are useless against the aliens.
",67,81,5,9,Soldier #1,Farmer17062,Farmer," The saucers! Theys'a crashin'!
",32,81,5,9,Soldier #1,Narrator17063,Narrator," In the end, it was not guns or bombs that defeated the aliens, but that humblest of all God's creatures, the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
",129,81,5,9,Farmer,Leela17064,Leela," I can't believe TiVo suggested that piece of...  Ow! Come on, Hermes. Surely you have the authority to remove this damn  collar.
",130,81,5,9,Narrator,Hermes17065,Hermes," Alas, no. I got the key but not the authority.
",48,81,5,9,Leela,Leela17066,Leela,"  Yeow! Well, who does have the authority?
",43,81,5,9,Hermes,Hermes17067,Hermes," Only the staff doctor. You'll have to convince him that you have resolved your anger issues.
",94,81,5,9,Leela,Leela17068,Leela," I don't have any god da-  mother f-  anger issues. 
Dwight: As your dwarf-skin canoe rounds a bend you suddenly see...  A terrifying red dragon.
",146,81,5,9,Hermes,Indian Boy17069,Indian Boy," What do we do? What do we do?
",31,81,5,9,Leela,Bender17070,Bender," Wait, I know. I make use of my rod of fireballs. 
",51,81,5,9,Indian Boy,Cubert17071,Cubert,"  Everyone knows red dragons are immune to fireballs as well as all other forms of incendiary attack.
",102,81,5,9,Bender,Bender17072,Bender," Yes, but I aim not at the dragon but at the river itself to create a shroud of steam through which we can escape.
",115,81,5,9,Cubert,All17073,All," Whoa!
",7,81,5,9,Bender,Dwight17074,Dwight,"  Sweet pony of Sierra Leone, it worked!
",41,81,5,9,All,Chinese Boy17075,Chinese Boy," We did it!
",12,81,5,9,Dwight,Cubert17076,Cubert," Success!
",10,81,5,9,Chinese Boy,Fry17077,Fry," Bender, smell this milk.
",26,81,5,9,Cubert,Bender17078,Bender," I go not by the name of Bender, you fleshy fool. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
",99,81,5,9,Fry,Fry17079,Fry," Professor, something's bothering me.
",38,81,5,9,Bender,Monkey17080,Monkey," Well, you can always talk to me about anything, Fry. What's on your mind?
",75,81,5,9,Fry,Fry17081,Fry," Well, it's... it's about my friend Bender.
",44,81,5,9,Monkey,Farnsworth Monkey17082,Farnsworth Monkey," Mmm. I see. Show me on this anatomically correct doll exactly where he touched you.
",85,81,5,9,Fry,Fry17083,Fry," No, it's nothing like that. It's just that I am worried about him. He's being playing an awful lot of Dungeons & Dragons.
",123,81,5,9,Farnsworth Monkey,Farnsworth Monkey17084,Farnsworth Monkey," Dungeons &... Good God! Hasn't he seen the Afterschool Special? You've got to talk to him, Fry. Make him quit now before he completely loses his mind.
",152,81,5,9,Fry,Fry17085,Fry," Okay, I will.
",15,81,5,9,Farnsworth Monkey,Farnsworth Monkey17086,Farnsworth Monkey," Good boy. Just don't let him touch you down there.
",52,81,5,9,Fry,Zoidberg17087,Zoidberg," Well, here's your problem, right here. You've got a skull embedded in your head.
",82,81,5,9,Farnsworth Monkey,Leela17088,Leela,"  You're absolutely right, Doctor. Can the collar come off now?
",64,81,5,9,Zoidberg,Zoidberg17089,Zoidberg," Let me just peel your head a little and see if I can get that skull out. 
Zoidberg: So, you tell me, little miss expert, why always with the temper? Calm down for once and think. Here, enjoy a relaxing spritz from my empathy bladder. 
Zoidberg: What is it, already? What's the cause of your anger?
",299,81,5,9,Leela,Leela17090,Leela," I guess I would have to say, I hate you. 
Zoidberg: I'm beginning to understand. It all goes back to your parents.
",116,81,5,9,Zoidberg,Leela17091,Leela," What? 
Zoidberg: They pushed you to study medicine when all you ever wanted was to be a song-and-dance man.  Why? Whyyy?
",122,81,5,9,Leela,Leela17092,Leela," I was raised in an orphanarium. My parents are sewer mutants who I never even met until a few years ago.
",106,81,5,9,Leela,Zoidberg17093,Zoidberg," Then you've got to go to them and work this song-and-dance stuff out. Maybe have them cook me nice dinner. No scallions. I hate them.  Amy, cancel my appointments.
",165,81,5,9,Leela,Amy17094,Amy," Stop calling me.
",18,81,5,9,Zoidberg,Fry17095,Fry," Bender, please don't get mad, but I think you might be playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
",93,81,5,9,Amy,Bender17096,Bender," You're absolutely right, Fry. I almost went insane, but after this heart-to-heart talk, I've decided to quit.
",111,81,5,9,Fry,Fry17097,Fry," Really? Whew! That's a load off my toad.
",42,81,5,9,Bender,Bender17098,Bender," Now, if you'll excuse me.  I'm off to slay the werewolf of Goblin Mountain. 
Bender: On guard, man-wench! Prepare to cross blades.
",132,81,5,9,Fry,Hermaphrobot17099,Hermaphrobot," You couldn't afford it, honey. 
Bender: Foolish leprechaun, I scoop your treasure in the name of the fancy men. 
",114,81,5,9,Bender,Hermes17100,Hermes," He also left a small pile of treasure on the living room rug.
",63,81,5,9,Hermaphrobot,Bender17101,Bender," Foul dragon, meet thy doom.
",29,81,5,9,Hermes,Turanga Munda17102,Turanga Munda," Would you like a napkin, Doctor?
",34,81,5,9,Bender,Zoidberg17103,Zoidberg," Thank you.
",12,81,5,9,Turanga Munda,Leela17104,Leela," Satisfied, Zoidberg? My relationship with my parents is fine.
",63,81,5,9,Zoidberg,Turanga Munda17105,Turanga Munda," Now, hold on, Leela. Maybe this torture collar is good for you.
",65,81,5,9,Leela,Leela17106,Leela," What?  Ow!
",12,81,5,9,Turanga Munda,Turanga Munda17107,Turanga Munda," It'll control your temper. Men like a woman who's not always slamming their head in the car door.
",99,81,5,9,Leela,Turanga Morris17108,Turanga Morris," She's right. That's what first attracted me to your mother. 
Turanga Munda: So, Leela, I understand your friend here is a physician, and I'm not seeing a ring on his claw.
",173,81,5,9,Turanga Munda,Leela17109,Leela," Mom, he's a cockroach from outer space. 
Zoidberg: Good, Leela, work that anger out. Excuse me a moment, I'm swarming with parasites. 
Turanga Morris: Hey, it's what's-his-name from the surface. The bi-clops.
",210,81,5,9,Turanga Morris,Fry17110,Fry," Ha-have you seen Bender? He's gone nuts. Also, smell this milk.
",65,81,5,9,Leela,Bender17111,Bender," Prepare for a surprise attack.
",32,81,5,9,Fry,Zoidberg17112,Zoidberg," Someone do something.
",23,81,5,9,Bender,Leela17113,Leela," I would, but...  Ow! Take my collar off.
",42,81,5,9,Zoidberg,Zoidberg17114,Zoidberg," I can't, I'm still eating.  Help me, Leela.
",45,81,5,9,Leela,Bender17115,Bender," I cast upon thee a spell of fireball! 
Zoidberg: No. Not the spork.
",69,81,5,9,Zoidberg,Fry17116,Fry,"  Beholdeth, Titanius, I cast a freeze ray upon you.
",53,81,5,9,Bender,Bender17117,Bender,"  That's ridiculous. There's no such thing as a ""freeze ray."" What, you mean a cone of coldness?
",97,81,5,9,Fry,Fry17118,Fry," Yeah, that.
",13,81,5,9,Bender,Bender17119,Bender," No! No! Fancy men are defenseless against cone of coldness.  I'm freezing... what? Ah! 
Fry: Bender, no. When will young people learn that Dungeons & Dragons won't make you cool?
",180,81,5,9,Fry,Zoidberg17120,Zoidberg," Relax, Fry. I'm a doctor. I'm sure the robut will be just fine with a little help.
",84,81,5,9,Bender,Bender17121,Bender," Help, help.   Help! 
",22,81,5,9,Zoidberg,Roberto17122,Roberto," Previously, on Futurama. Hah-haa! 
",36,82,5,10,Bender,Dwight17123,Dwight," A terrifying red dragon!
",26,82,5,10,Roberto,Bender17124,Bender," I make use of my rod of fireballs. 
",37,82,5,10,Dwight,Farnsworth17125,Farnsworth," The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence. 
",72,82,5,10,Bender,Leela17126,Leela," Ouch!
",7,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Fry17127,Fry," Bender, I think you might be  playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
",68,82,5,10,Leela,Bender17128,Bender," You're absolutely right, Fry.  Now, if you'll excuse me.  I'm off to slay the werewolf of Goblin Mountain. 
",109,82,5,10,Fry,Dr. Perceptron17129,Dr. Perceptron," Please, send in the patient.
",30,82,5,10,Bender,Intercom Assistant17130,Intercom Assistant," Yes, Doctor. 
",15,82,5,10,Dr. Perceptron,Bender17131,Bender," Wee!
",6,82,5,10,Intercom Assistant,Dr. Perceptron17132,Dr. Perceptron," So,  Bender, I understand you're having trouble separating fantasy from reality.
",82,82,5,10,Bender,Bender17133,Bender," Says who? Was it the bugbear? Is he talking about me again?
",61,82,5,10,Dr. Perceptron,Dr. Perceptron17134,Dr. Perceptron," I understand. Commence therapy. 
",34,82,5,10,Bender,Fry17135,Fry," Poor Bender. Says here to tell his friends he's at a spa.
",59,82,5,10,Dr. Perceptron,Amy17136,Amy," So what happened to Bender?
",29,82,5,10,Fry,Fry17137,Fry," He's at a spa.
",16,82,5,10,Amy,Amy17138,Amy," Wow, there's a spa in the nut house?
",38,82,5,10,Fry,Zoidberg17139,Zoidberg," Friends, friends, stop everything. There's food in this shaker. 
",66,82,5,10,Amy,Leela17140,Leela," Ow! Can you please remove this anger collar?
",46,82,5,10,Zoidberg,Hermes17141,Hermes," Are you still angry?
",22,82,5,10,Leela,Leela17142,Leela," No.  Ow!
",10,82,5,10,Hermes,Hermes17143,Hermes," It also shocks you when you lie.
",34,82,5,10,Leela,Farnsworth17144,Farnsworth," Quiet, everyone. The network news is on and if I, a 165-year-old man, don't watch it, who will?
",97,82,5,10,Hermes,Morbo17145,Morbo," Thankfully, the amazing talking horse was rescued and safely returned to the meat department.
",95,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Linda17146,Linda,"  Turning to the less stupid portion of our broadcast, fuel prices hit an all-time high today due to the ongoing dark matter shortage.
",135,82,5,10,Morbo,Morbo17147,Morbo," Earlier, our own Morbo sat down with Mom, CEO of Mom's Friendly Multinational Energy Conglomerate.
",100,82,5,10,Linda,Morbo17148,Morbo,"  Morbo the Annihilator, here, sitting down to a delightful tea in this fake living room set.  Thank you for joining us, Mom.
",126,82,5,10,Morbo,Mom17149,Mom," My pleasure, sugarplum.
",25,82,5,10,Morbo,Morbo17150,Morbo," Mom, you control the world's only dark matter mine. Why are fuel prices so high?
",82,82,5,10,Mom,Mom17151,Mom," Oh! It's terrible, isn't it? Dark matter is just so rare nowadays, but we'll keep pinching loaf after loaf from the bowels of the earth, even if I lose money on every log.
",173,82,5,10,Morbo,Morbo17152,Morbo," If you are losing money, how did you post record profits last quarter?
",72,82,5,10,Mom,Mom17153,Mom," You look thin, care for one of my famous pecan clusters?
",58,82,5,10,Morbo,Morbo17154,Morbo,"  Morbo shouldn't. It will go straight to Morbo's gargantuan forehead. Oh, what the heck? I guess I could destroy one or two of them. 
",135,82,5,10,Mom,Mom17155,Mom," Do people care enough to drill for dark matter even in an Alaskan wildlife refuge? People do.
",95,82,5,10,Morbo,Farnsworth17156,Farnsworth," Greedy old hag, taste the wrath of my fuzzy slipper. 
",55,82,5,10,Mom,Leela17157,Leela," Professor, why are you so hot and dusty over this dark matter shortage?
",73,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17158,Farnsworth," Oohh... I bet you'd like to know. I bet you'd like to know, indeed.
",69,82,5,10,Leela,Walt17159,Walt," Hello, Mother. How did the interview go?
",42,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Mom17160,Mom," It made me want to puke my face off. Where's my Thigh Blaster?
",64,82,5,10,Walt,Larry17161,Larry," Right here, Mom.
",18,82,5,10,Mom,Mom17162,Mom," Shut up!
",10,82,5,10,Larry,Larry17163,Larry," Okay, thank you.
",18,82,5,10,Mom,Mom17164,Mom," Burn, you damn thighs. Burn!
",30,82,5,10,Larry,Igner17165,Igner," Mommy, are you upset 'cause of the dark matter shortage?
",58,82,5,10,Mom,Mom17166,Mom," There is no shortage, you moronic ass-brain!
",46,82,5,10,Igner,Inger17167,Inger," There's not? But you said...
",30,82,5,10,Mom,Mom17168,Mom,"  Allow me to explain. Suppose this hand represents current reserves of dark matter and this hand represents consumer demand.
",126,82,5,10,Inger,Igner17169,Igner," Uh-huh.
",9,82,5,10,Mom,Farnsworth17170,Farnsworth," I just bet you'd like to know why I'm so angry about this dark matter shortage. I bet very much you'd like to know.
",117,82,5,10,Igner,Amy17171,Amy," You're right, Professor. We would like to know.
",49,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17172,Farnsworth," Really? I didn't think anyone was interested. It all started 30-odd years ago.  I was working in Mom's laboratories for the third time after twice before realizing how evil she was and vowing never to work for her again. But somehow the rich, wrong stench of her boney charms kept calling me back.
",299,82,5,10,Amy,Zoidberg17173,Zoidberg," Don't stop, Professor. I'm getting aroused. 
",46,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17174,Farnsworth," Back in those days, dark matter was just a worthless inert curiosity, and I was smashing it in a particle accelerator, in an ill-conceived attempt to create a more durable harpsichord wax. But, as Deepak Chopra taught us, quantum physics means anything can happen at any time for no reason. Also, eat plenty of oatmeal and animals never had a war. Who's the real animals?  And thus against all probabilities... it happened. [The dark matter particles in the particle accelerator begin colliding and exploding. A large explosion leaves only a single item - the single non-local metaparticle crystal.
",600,82,5,10,Zoidberg,Younger Farnsworth17175,Younger Farnsworth," Dang!
",7,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17176,Farnsworth," I'm sure I don't need to explain that all dark matter in the universe is linked in the form of a single non-local meta-particle.
",130,82,5,10,Younger Farnsworth,Amy17177,Amy," Guhh! Stop patronizing us.
",28,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17178,Farnsworth," So, in one instant, I had transformed all dark matter everywhere into a new crystalline form...  ...making it the most potent fuel since primitive man first ignited mastodon flatulence to heat his cave.
",204,82,5,10,Amy,Younger Mom17179,Younger Mom," I'm intrigued, Hubert. You have my undivided attention.
",57,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Younger Mom17180,Younger Mom," Shut up, you milk-sucking leeches! A new super fuel, eh? We're rich.
",70,82,5,10,Younger Mom,Younger Farnsworth17181,Younger Farnsworth," Indeed, we are.
",17,82,5,10,Younger Mom,Younger Mom17182,Younger Mom," Not you, we. Us, we.  I'm getting back together with my ex-husband.
",69,82,5,10,Younger Farnsworth,Younger Farnsworth17183,Younger Farnsworth," Wernstrom!
",12,82,5,10,Younger Mom,Younger Wernstrom17184,Younger Wernstrom," You've been played, Farnsworth. Played like a cheap harpsichord.
",66,82,5,10,Younger Farnsworth,Younger Mom17185,Younger Mom," Walt, fire that employee like Mommy taught you.
",49,82,5,10,Younger Wernstrom,Leela17186,Leela," Professor, maybe I can help you get even with Mom. I spend most of my time thinking about how to get revenge on a bad boss.
",125,82,5,10,Younger Mom,Fry17187,Fry," Me, too.
",10,82,5,10,Leela,Zoidberg17188,Zoidberg," Ditto!
",8,82,5,10,Fry,Hermes17189,Hermes," Likewise.
",11,82,5,10,Zoidberg,Amy17190,Amy," I made a blinding powder.
",27,82,5,10,Hermes,Farnsworth17191,Farnsworth," Thanks, but that won't be necessary because I have the ultimate weapon.  You see, in the instant the energy crystal was created, there also came into being an opposite crystal made of pure anti-backwards energy.
",213,82,5,10,Amy,All17192,All," Wow!
",6,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Hermes17193,Hermes," So?
",5,82,5,10,All,Farnsworth17194,Farnsworth," So, this! If ever the two crystals should meet, their wave functions would collapse like Raymond Burr's trampoline, once again rendering all dark matter inert and useless as fuel.
",181,82,5,10,Hermes,Hermes17195,Hermes," But then we'll have no fuel.
",30,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17196,Farnsworth," But once we free society from dependence on Mom's dark matter, scientists will finally care enough to develop cleaner, alternative fuels.
",139,82,5,10,Hermes,Fry17197,Fry," Scientists like you!
",22,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17198,Farnsworth," No, not me. I'm too busy developing makeup for dogs. That's where the money is.
",81,82,5,10,Fry,Leela17199,Leela,"  This is our chance to teach Mom a lesson. Let's take the anti-crystal and shove it up Mom's regular crystal.
",111,82,5,10,Farnsworth,All17200,All," Yeah.
",7,82,5,10,Leela,Hermes17201,Hermes," Fight the power!
",18,82,5,10,All,Farnsworth17202,Farnsworth," There's just one, small problem, and it's a big one. I hid the crystal and I can't remember where.
",100,82,5,10,Hermes,Hermes17203,Hermes," Surely it's just a matter of waiting till you next move your bowels and then using a potato masher...
",103,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17204,Farnsworth," Don't you think I already tried that? No. I'm afraid, the crystal is lost forever.
",84,82,5,10,Hermes,Dwight17205,Dwight," Nine? You did it. You outwitted the fungus.

",102,82,5,10,Chinese Boy,Rosie17209,Rosie," Everything must be clean, very clean. That's why the dog had to die. He was a dirty dog. Dirty, dirty. Also, that boy, Elroy. Dirty, dirty.

",16,82,5,10,Intercom Assistant,Roberto17215,Roberto," Well, well. Looks like old Roberto is the focus of attention now. Stop looking at me. 
",88,82,5,10,Mad Hatterbot,Dr. Perceptron17216,Dr. Perceptron," Calm down, Roberto. Tell us about your childhood.
",51,82,5,10,Roberto,Roberto17217,Roberto," I was designed by a team of engineers attempting to build an insane robot. But it seems they failed.
",102,82,5,10,Dr. Perceptron,Convenience Store Bot17218,Convenience Store Bot," Um, actually... 
",18,82,5,10,Roberto,Bender17219,Bender," Look, we have to accept the fact that we all have a serious problem.

",7,82,5,10,Bender,Dr. Perceptron17221,Dr. Perceptron," Good, Bender.
",15,82,5,10,Roberto,Rosie17222,Rosie," That's right.
",15,82,5,10,Dr. Perceptron,Bender17223,Bender," There's a band of river trolls living in the moat and they may have no intention of letting us out of this castle, unless we hand over the Golden Scepter of Zanthor.

",27,82,5,10,Roberto,Bender17226,Bender," I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
",77,82,5,10,Dr. Perceptron,Dr. Perceptron17227,Dr. Perceptron," You are suffering a breakdown.  I'm in your seat. I forgot we had changed places.

",22,82,5,10,Dr. Perceptron,Amy17229,Amy," You perfected dog mascara?
",28,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17230,Farnsworth," Far from it. If you ask me, they look like a bunch of hookers. But what I have invented is a means of locating the missing crystal.  When I push this button, the crystal will emit a high-frequency stink.
",205,82,5,10,Amy,Zoidberg17231,Zoidberg,"  Hurray!
",10,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17232,Farnsworth," There. Now, with any luck I'll detect it with my smelling aid.  I just pray to all powerful Atheismo that we find it before Mom does.
",135,82,5,10,Zoidberg,Hermes17233,Hermes," Do you smell the crystal, Professor?
",38,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17234,Farnsworth," No, damn it! Just the alluring scent of Obsession for spaniels.
",65,82,5,10,Hermes,Dwight17235,Dwight," Dude. Who whipped an egger?
",29,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Dwight17236,Dwight," Well, he who denied it, supplied it.
",38,82,5,10,Dwight,Cubert17237,Cubert," Well, he who articulated it, particulated it.
",47,82,5,10,Dwight,Dwight17238,Dwight," Well, he who refuted it, tooted it.

",12,82,5,10,Dwight,Mom17240,Mom," Jesus craps. The anti-backwards crystal.
",42,82,5,10,Cubert,Larry17241,Larry," Ow! Ah... sorry?
",18,82,5,10,Mom,Mom17242,Mom," Relax, it's not your fault.  I can't believe it still exists. Google the hell out of that skanker.  Planet-sucking-Express? Of course. How could I have been so dumb?  With that crystal, Farnsworth could completely destroy my dark matter empire. I underestimated that sagging old bag of bones and gonads.
",305,82,5,10,Larry,Inger17243,Inger," Is that man bad?
",18,82,5,10,Mom,Mom17244,Mom," Very bad, Igner. And that's why I need you three to go steal the anti-crystal away from him. But be careful. You'll need all your stoogely cunning.
",149,82,5,10,Inger,Walt17245,Walt," Exterminators.
",16,82,5,10,Mom,Fry17246,Fry," Oh, great. What do we got? Wall gophers? Toilet snails?
",57,82,5,10,Walt,Walt17247,Walt," No, I'm afraid you've got owls. Over there, see?
",50,82,5,10,Fry,Igner17248,Igner," Ow!
",5,82,5,10,Walt,Walt17249,Walt," Dump the bag, you nitwit.
",27,82,5,10,Igner,Larry17250,Larry," Hey, watch it. 
",17,82,5,10,Walt,Walt17251,Walt," Quiet, you.  Ow!
",18,82,5,10,Larry,Fry17252,Fry," I was looking over there for a long time but I didn't see any... Oh, there they are. Gross.
",93,82,5,10,Walt,Walt17253,Walt," We've got to act fast. Larry, get out the geigersniffer.
",58,82,5,10,Fry,Larry17254,Larry," You're just gonna hit me with it.
",35,82,5,10,Walt,Walt17255,Walt," No. I'm going to hit you with this. 
",38,82,5,10,Larry,Fry17256,Fry," Those three exterminators are hilarious.
",42,82,5,10,Walt,Amy17257,Amy," Really? I don't think so.
",27,82,5,10,Fry,Leela17258,Leela," Me, neither. Now, Sex and the City, that's funny.
",51,82,5,10,Amy,Dwight17259,Dwight," After wandering aimlessly in the swamp, you suddenly...  wander aimlessly in the swamp.
",89,82,5,10,Leela,Walt17260,Walt," There it is. 
",15,82,5,10,Dwight,Cubert17261,Cubert," Uh, excuse you.
",17,82,5,10,Walt,Walt17262,Walt," I'm sorry, little boy. You see, we're owl exterminators.
",58,82,5,10,Cubert,Igner17263,Igner," We are owl extermin...  Ow!
",29,82,5,10,Walt,Walt17264,Walt," And what we have here is an owl egg that's about to hatch into an owl larva. So, if you don't mind, we'll just take this and...
",129,82,5,10,Igner,Cubert17265,Cubert,"  What are you, stupid? That's a dodecahedral crystal I found hidden in the downstairs walrus tank.
",100,82,5,10,Walt,Dwight17266,Dwight," And I wrote numbers on it so we could use it as a D12, 'cause I have the best handwriting.
",92,82,5,10,Cubert,Cubert17267,Cubert," Do not.
",9,82,5,10,Dwight,Dwight17268,Dwight," Do too.
",9,82,5,10,Cubert,Cubert17269,Cubert," Do not.
",9,82,5,10,Dwight,Dwight17270,Dwight," Do too.
",9,82,5,10,Cubert,Cubert17271,Cubert," You win this round.
",21,82,5,10,Dwight,Farnsworth17272,Farnsworth," What's going on here?
",23,82,5,10,Cubert,Igner17273,Igner," We're owl exterminators.
",26,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17274,Farnsworth," Oh? Then you won't have any problem exterminating this owl.
",61,82,5,10,Igner,Farnsworth17275,Farnsworth," My anti-backwards crystal. So it's you three. I should have known Mom would send her brainless brood to do her dirty work. Walt, the leader among imbeciles.
",158,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Walt17276,Walt," Hey! They resent that.
",24,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17277,Farnsworth," Larry, the snivelling middle child.
",37,82,5,10,Walt,Larry17278,Larry," Sorry. Thank you.
",19,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17279,Farnsworth," And you, Igner. The evil I could tolerate, but the stupidity... 
Igner: We're owl exterminators.
",98,82,5,10,Larry,Farnsworth17280,Farnsworth," Good God. Just knowing we're in the same genus makes me embarrassed to call myself homo.  Now, get out and tell Mom thanks for the crystal. 
",142,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Igner17281,Igner," Thanks for the crystal.
",25,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Fry17282,Fry," There. The repairs are complete.
",34,82,5,10,Igner,Farnsworth17283,Farnsworth,"  Let's go, already. We've got to infiltrate Mom's dark matter mine, now. How do you start this thing?  Good Lord, woman. Can you move any slower?  Rake up some dark matter and top off the tank.
",195,82,5,10,Fry,Leela17284,Leela," Well, there isn't any dark matter. Nibbler hasn't pooped at all. And he ate a whole family of koalas last night. Nibbler! Nibbler!
",132,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17285,Farnsworth," I'm not interested in the whereabouts of your cutesy-fruitsy space rat. The only thing that matters right now is this crystal. 
",129,82,5,10,Leela,Leela17286,Leela," Ow!
",5,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17287,Farnsworth," And be careful with that crystal. 
Bender:   Death to ogres! 
",63,82,5,10,Leela,Dr. Perceptron17288,Dr. Perceptron," Even relaxation therapy has failed. Nurse, schedule a robotomy for Bender.
",76,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Nurse Ratchet17289,Nurse Ratchet," Yes, Doctor. I'll get the tools from the shed.
",48,82,5,10,Dr. Perceptron,Dr. Perceptron17290,Dr. Perceptron," It's a very painful procedure. So until then, just try to relax.
",66,82,5,10,Nurse Ratchet,Mom17291,Mom," What are you laughing at?
",27,82,5,10,Dr. Perceptron,Larry17292,Larry," Your laugh. It's just so infectious.
",38,82,5,10,Mom,Mom17293,Mom," So's herpes. Now, shut up! You and Walt, lead the killbots to the surface and blow Farnsworth out of the sky.
",111,82,5,10,Larry,Walt17294,Walt," What about Igner?
",19,82,5,10,Mom,Mom17295,Mom," That hairless ape? I swear. When he came out I flipped a coin whether to keep him or the after-birth.
",103,82,5,10,Walt,Walt17296,Walt," Yes, Mother. You told that story at his graduation.
",53,82,5,10,Mom,Mom17297,Mom," I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission. You see, there is a terrible secret about Igner I've never told anyone. And here it is.
",137,82,5,10,Walt,Walt17298,Walt," Continue returning fire.
",26,82,5,10,Mom,Killbot #1 117299,Killbot #1 1,"  What?
",8,82,5,10,Walt,Killbot #1 217300,Killbot #1 2,"  What did they say?
",21,82,5,10,Killbot #1 1,Killbot #1 117301,Killbot #1 1," I don't know. I can't hear a thing.
",37,82,5,10,Killbot #1 2,Killbot #1 317302,Killbot #1 3,"  Hey, what's everybody talking about?
",39,82,5,10,Killbot #1 1,Farnsworth17303,Farnsworth," Mayday! Mayday!  Oh, God. I cannot believe this is the best plan I could come up with.  We weren't actually in the ship.
",122,82,5,10,Killbot #1 3,Leela17304,Leela," Okay, team, these red-hot, razor-sharp fans are the only safe way into the mine.
",82,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Fry17305,Fry," Hmm, uh, ladies first.  Phew! That blade missed me by the skin of my pants. 
",78,82,5,10,Leela,Elevator Steward17306,Elevator Steward," Maintenance shaft 7 serving...
",32,82,5,10,Fry,Farnsworth17307,Farnsworth," Shut your mouth.
",18,82,5,10,Elevator Steward,Elevator Steward17308,Elevator Steward," I'm just talking about the shaft.
",35,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Fry17309,Fry," Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?
",39,82,5,10,Elevator Steward,Leela17310,Leela," Actually, feels kind of good. I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up.
",108,82,5,10,Fry,Walt17311,Walt," We shot them down, Mother. The intruders never even got to Sector 1.
",70,82,5,10,Leela,Security Woman #117312,Security Woman #1," Intruders in Sector 15. Intruders in Sector 15.
",49,82,5,10,Walt,Mom17313,Mom," Ugh... Sometimes I don't know why I even bother to slap you.   All Killbots to Sector 15.
",91,82,5,10,Security Woman #1,Killbot #1 117314,Killbot #1 1,"  What did she say?
",20,82,5,10,Mom,Killbot #1 217315,Killbot #1 2," What did you say? 
",20,82,5,10,Killbot #1 1,Fry17316,Fry," There are so many killbots behind us I can't count them all. Three, I think.
",78,82,5,10,Killbot #1 2,Leela17317,Leela," We're trapped.
",16,82,5,10,Fry,Farnsworth17318,Farnsworth," The main pit must be in here. I'm detecting vast quantities of Dark Matter.
",77,82,5,10,Leela,Leela17319,Leela," Step aside turkey-neck. I think I know the code. 
",51,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17320,Farnsworth," We're in. We're in the heart of the mine. The very source of all Mom's wealth and... 
",87,82,5,10,Leela,Leela17321,Leela," My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm.
",51,82,5,10,Farnsworth,Fry17322,Fry," Is there really so much of a distinction? I mean...
",53,82,5,10,Leela,Nibbler17323,Nibbler,"  Leela, it's me, Nibbler.
",27,82,5,10,Fry,Leela17324,Leela," Oh, my God, you look horrible, Nibbler. I think I'm going to vomit.
",69,82,5,10,Nibbler,Nibblonian17325,Nibblonian," Nibbler is over there.
",24,82,5,10,Leela,Leela17326,Leela," Oh, sorry. Nibbler!
",21,82,5,10,Nibblonian,Morbo17327,Morbo," Previously, on puny Futurama. Mwaah! 
",39,83,5,11,Leela,Bender17328,Bender," Foolish leprechaun, I scoop your treasure in the name of the fancy men. 
",74,83,5,11,Morbo,Fry17329,Fry," Bender, I think you might be  playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
",68,83,5,11,Bender,Bender17330,Bender," I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
",77,83,5,11,Fry,Dr. Perceptron17331,Dr. Perceptron," Please, send in the patient.
",30,83,5,11,Bender,Bender17332,Bender," Wee!
",6,83,5,11,Dr. Perceptron,Farnsworth17333,Farnsworth," The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence. 
",72,83,5,11,Bender,Leela17334,Leela," Ouch!
",7,83,5,11,Farnsworth,Fry17335,Fry," Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?
",39,83,5,11,Leela,Leela17336,Leela," Actually, I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up.
",88,83,5,11,Fry,Morbo17337,Morbo," Mom, you control the world's only dark matter mine.
",53,83,5,11,Leela,Leela17338,Leela," My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm. 
",52,83,5,11,Morbo,Leela17339,Leela," Oh, my poor little snuzzy-wuzzams. Are they treating you okay?
",64,83,5,11,Leela,Nibbler17340,Nibbler," No, they are force-feeding us so we poop more dark matter. It's horrible.  Those are good. You've got to help us.
",115,83,5,11,Leela,Nibblonians17341,Nibblonians," Help us!
",10,83,5,11,Nibbler,Nibblonian17342,Nibblonian," Help us, for God's sakes!
",27,83,5,11,Nibblonians,Leela17343,Leela," Nibbler made a bo-bo.
",23,83,5,11,Nibblonian,Nibbler17344,Nibbler," But not on my terms. I will not be treated like... Hey, wait, aren't you amazed I can speak?
",94,83,5,11,Leela,Fry17345,Fry," Well, actually, no. You forgot to blank our memories after you spoke last time.
",81,83,5,11,Nibbler,Nibbler17346,Nibbler," Then why did you let me eat Friskies and make bo-bo in a litter box?
",70,83,5,11,Fry,Fry17347,Fry," Well, you're cuter that way.
",30,83,5,11,Nibbler,Farnsworth17348,Farnsworth," Cute as a baby's buttocks.
",28,83,5,11,Fry,Leela17349,Leela," So what happened? How did Mom capture all you Nibblonians?
",60,83,5,11,Farnsworth,Nibbler17350,Nibbler,"  It all began 36 years ago...  Now! On the planet Vergon 6.   It was a veritable Eden, brimming with unique and irreplaceable species.  Most of which were delicious.  I was Supreme Fuzzler of a Nibblonian scientific outpost. It was paradise, until they came. One of your DOOP ships struck dark matter, little realizing it was not a natural deposit, but rather centuries of Nibblonian fecal material.
",401,83,5,11,Leela,Fry17351,Fry," The big faecal enchilada. Anyone else hungry?
",47,83,5,11,Nibbler,Nibbler17352,Nibbler," The DOOP contracted a ruthless businesswoman to spearhead the mining operation.
",81,83,5,11,Fry,Leela17353,Leela," Let me guess. Mom?
",20,83,5,11,Nibbler,Nibbler17354,Nibbler," The very same.
",16,83,5,11,Leela,Fry17355,Fry," Can I also guess Mom?
",23,83,5,11,Nibbler,Nibbler17356,Nibbler," To reduce cost she started a new enterprise, Mom's Friendly Robots, to build robot slaves. Remember this was back in the days before Robot Lincoln.
",149,83,5,11,Fry,Mom17357,Mom," Faster, faster!
",17,83,5,11,Nibbler,Robot #1 Slave17358,Robot #1 Slave," I'm going exactly as fast as you built me to go.
",50,83,5,11,Mom,Mom17359,Mom," Oh, wise guy, huh?
",20,83,5,11,Robot #1 Slave,Robot #1 Slave17360,Robot #1 Slave," Ow!
",5,83,5,11,Mom,Nibbler17361,Nibbler," Eventually, the planet was mined down to a hollow shell and my people were forced to evacuate.  Alas, I had eaten a day-old Swinosaur for lunch. And while doing some evacuating of my own, I was left behind. [He makes noises that often accompany bowel movements. Mom is watching him Mom: So, that's where it comes from. We may have a whole new source of Dark Matter on our hands.
",380,83,5,11,Robot #1 Slave,Igner17362,Igner," Eww!
",6,83,5,11,Nibbler,Nibbler17363,Nibbler," As it turned out I was the lucky one.  Unbeknownst to me, Mom captured my colleagues and enslaved them here in this... this... crap farm.
",139,83,5,11,Igner,Nibblonian17364,Nibblonian," There's nothing to do but eat and crap, eat and crap. It's like visiting my parents.
",86,83,5,11,Nibbler,Nibbler17365,Nibbler," As for me, I emerged from behind the ""bush of many uses"" to find I had been left behind. I was doomed, doomed.
",112,83,5,11,Nibblonian,Leela17366,Leela," Hello, there.
",15,83,5,11,Nibbler,Nibbler17367,Nibbler," Startled, my cuteness reflex kicked in.
",41,83,5,11,Leela,Leela17368,Leela," I'll call him Nibbler.
",24,83,5,11,Nibbler,Nibbler17369,Nibbler," A silly name for a high-ranking Fuzzler. But, hey, I was glad to be rescued. 
Leela: But then, how did you end up here with the others?
",137,83,5,11,Leela,Nibbler17370,Nibbler," I was kidnapped yesterday by Mom's vile sons in their moronic disguises.
",74,83,5,11,Nibbler,Igner17371,Igner," I was an owl exterminator.  Do you have the crysal?
",53,83,5,11,Nibbler,Farnsworth17372,Farnsworth," It's pronounced ""crystal,"" you lump.
",38,83,5,11,Igner,Igner17373,Igner," Go, run fast. 
Walt: Did you see anyone?
",42,83,5,11,Farnsworth,Igner17374,Igner," Me?
",5,83,5,11,Igner,Walt17375,Walt," Yes, you. You're the only one here.
",37,83,5,11,Igner,Igner17376,Igner," If I'm the only one here, then how could I see anyone?
",56,83,5,11,Walt,Larry17377,Larry," He's got a point, Walt.
",25,83,5,11,Igner,Walt17378,Walt," So does my knee.
",18,83,5,11,Larry,Fry17379,Fry," This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the chickens.
",57,83,5,11,Walt,Nurse Ratchet17380,Nurse Ratchet," Don't worry, those clamps are for my own protection.
",54,83,5,11,Fry,Dr. Perceptron17381,Dr. Perceptron," Do you know where you are, Bender?
",36,83,5,11,Nurse Ratchet,Bender17382,Bender," Sure do, I'm in the magical land of Cornwood, frolicking with wenches.
",72,83,5,11,Dr. Perceptron,Dr. Perceptron17383,Dr. Perceptron," Close. You're in the loony bin for a robotomy. 
Nurse Ratchet: Can't you just use the access panel?
",101,83,5,11,Bender,Dr. Perceptron17384,Dr. Perceptron," Either way is fine.
",21,83,5,11,Dr. Perceptron,Bender17385,Bender,"  Does anyone else smell burning dragon beak?
",46,83,5,11,Dr. Perceptron,Mom17386,Mom," Wherever you are, Farnsworth, my boys will find you. 
Walt: They've eluded us, Mother. But rest assured, we've already slapped each other, so there's no need to... 
Mom: You'll thank me some day when you are slapping your own kids.  I know Farnsworth's game. He is going to try to poke his clammy old crystal at my hot fiery crystal.
",335,83,5,11,Bender,Larry17387,Larry," Mom!
",6,83,5,11,Mom,Mom17388,Mom," If the crystals get within six inches of each other...  Wham! All my dark matter will be worthless.
",101,83,5,11,Larry,Mom17389,Mom," Get them!
",11,83,5,11,Mom,Leela17390,Leela,"  Ooh. That feels good.
",24,83,5,11,Mom,Mom17391,Mom," Oh, for crying out...  Oh, the freaking battery's dead. Walt, where's the charger?
",84,83,5,11,Leela,Walt17392,Walt," In the hardware drawer, Mother. 
Mom: Damn tangled mess of wires.
",67,83,5,11,Mom,Farnsworth17393,Farnsworth," We're almost there. The crystals are beginning to engorge.  I can't quite reach. Fry, grab onto my easy-fit waistband. Just a few more inches. Come on, really wedgie it on in there.  So, that's why they call me the Catman. 
Mom: Nobody move. I've found the charger.  Hang on. I'm on it. Okay, there!
",301,83,5,11,Walt,Fry17394,Fry," Save us, Catman.
",18,83,5,11,Farnsworth,Mom17395,Mom," It's over, Hubert. Give me the anti-backwards crystal.
",56,83,5,11,Fry,Farnsworth17396,Farnsworth," Never! 
Mom: Oh, bravo. You're in a crap-harvesting factory, genius. Walt! Larry! Start harvesting. 
",102,83,5,11,Mom,Farnsworth17397,Farnsworth," No! 
Dr. Perceptron: I will now delicately jerk out your imagination, severing fantasy's grip on your nerd-circuit.
",117,83,5,11,Farnsworth,Bender17398,Bender," Cornwood! 
Dr. Perceptron: Illogical. Illogical.
",50,83,5,11,Farnsworth,Nurse Ratchet17399,Nurse Ratchet," But, Doctor, I love you. 
Mom: Oh, what now?
",46,83,5,11,Bender,Frydo17400,Frydo," This is crazy. Ow! What the... You okay, Leela?
",49,83,5,11,Nurse Ratchet,Leegola17401,Leegola," I think so.
",13,83,5,11,Frydo,Frydo17402,Frydo," Wait a second. Is there something different about your hooves? 
Leegola: Oh, Lord. I'm half-horse and half-naked.
",115,83,5,11,Leegola,Frydo17403,Frydo," Where the hell are we, hell?
",30,83,5,11,Frydo,Frydo17404,Frydo," Bender?
",9,83,5,11,Frydo,Titanius Anglesmith17405,Titanius Anglesmith," I know not of this Bender. I'm Titanius Anglesmith. Welcome to Cornwood!
",74,83,5,11,Frydo,Titanius Anglesmith17406,Titanius Anglesmith," Wretched peasants, put aside your cares and feast on the succulent flesh of the roast munchkin!
",97,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Peasent Cook17407,Peasent Cook," Care for a slice of scroto?
",29,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Frydo17408,Frydo," Uh... that's his name, right?
",31,83,5,11,Peasent Cook,Peasent Cook17409,Peasent Cook," 'Tis also that, sir.
",22,83,5,11,Frydo,Titanius Anglesmith17410,Titanius Anglesmith," We're honored this eve by a visit from my friends of old, Frydo and Leegola. So let the dwarves do their gay dance and let the gnomes play their sissy piccolos.  Dance! Dance, you little freaks. Faster.  Faster! 
Dwarf: My ankle!
",231,83,5,11,Peasent Cook,Titanius Anglesmith17411,Titanius Anglesmith," To the kitchen with him!
",26,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Dwarf17412,Dwarf," Wait! Wait! Wait! I do impressions. Behold! The swamp hag: ""Get out of my swamp, you kids!""
",93,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Titanius Anglesmith17413,Titanius Anglesmith," Don't let him get too crispy.
",31,83,5,11,Dwarf,Calculon17414,Calculon," Lord Anglesmith.
",18,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Titanius Anglesmith17415,Titanius Anglesmith," You have ridden hard, noble squire. May I offer you a horn of ale and a shank of dwarf?
",89,83,5,11,Calculon,Calculon17416,Calculon," 'Tis dire news, sire. Dark riders approach.
",45,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Titanius Anglesmith17417,Titanius Anglesmith,"  You shall be handsomely rewarded, sir knight. We ride at once!  Oops!  Frydo! Saddle up that trusty steed.
",109,83,5,11,Calculon,Frydo17418,Frydo," What's happening? And why am I enjoying it so much?
",53,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Titanius Anglesmith17419,Titanius Anglesmith," Foul beast-bags! Meet thy doom!
",33,83,5,11,Frydo,Waltazar17420,Waltazar," Follow me.
",12,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Waltazar17421,Waltazar," Damn thee, Ignus.
",19,83,5,11,Waltazar,Larius17422,Larius," Well, you said to follow you.
",31,83,5,11,Waltazar,Waltazar17423,Waltazar," Well, now I say follow this! 
Larius: The Die of Power! He's rolling it.
",74,83,5,11,Larius,Waltazar17424,Waltazar," Oh, no!
",9,83,5,11,Waltazar,Titanius Anglesmith17425,Titanius Anglesmith," I'm back bab-... 
Die of Power: Seven. 
Titanius Anglesmith: ""Banish foes""? Cool.
",83,83,5,11,Waltazar,Waltazar17426,Waltazar," No! No!
",9,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Larius17427,Larius," I got to say, I had no idea the Die of Power was so powerful.
",63,83,5,11,Waltazar,Waltazar17428,Waltazar," Did you have any idea of... 
Swamp Hag: Get out of my swamp, you kids!
",72,83,5,11,Larius,Leegola17429,Leegola," I can't believe I'm saying this, but that was really exciting. I've never felt so alive.  What else can we slay? Is that a hobbit over there?
",143,83,5,11,Waltazar,Titanius Anglesmith17430,Titanius Anglesmith," No, that's a hobo and a rabbit. But they're making a hobbit.
",62,83,5,11,Leegola,Frydo17431,Frydo," Thank God, an outhouse.
",25,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Titanius Anglesmith17432,Titanius Anglesmith," Hush! This be no outhouse, but the lair of the great wizard Grayfarn.
",71,83,5,11,Frydo,Greyfarn17433,Greyfarn," Who is it? 
Titanius Anglesmith: 'Tis I, Titanius.
",52,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Greyfarn17434,Greyfarn," Just a moment. 
Titanius Anglesmith:  Methinks the wizard be casting a powerful spell, indeed.
",96,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Greyfarn17435,Greyfarn," Come in! Come in! Yes. 'Tis a powerful object in both our worlds. If you failed to destroy it in yours, perhaps you were brought here that you might have a second chance.
",172,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Frydo17436,Frydo," So, this land is real?
",24,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Greyfarn17437,Greyfarn," Oh, dreadfully real. If you die here, you'll really be dead. But instead of science, we believe in crazy hocus-pocus. It's like Kansas.
",137,83,5,11,Frydo,Leegola17438,Leegola," God help us.
",14,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Greyfarn17439,Greyfarn," Cornwood's troubles began hundreds or perhaps millions of years ago.  Deep in the Geysers of Gygax, Momon herself injection-molded the Dice of Power from the living plastic.
",175,83,5,11,Leegola,Momon17440,Momon,"  Damn, these are hot.
",23,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Leegola17441,Leegola," Ah ha! In our universe she's called Mom.
",42,83,5,11,Momon,Greyfarn17442,Greyfarn," In your universe, are you taught not to interrupt? Evidently not. Anyway, Momon spawned three rotten sons, whom you've already had the displeasure of meeting. Waltazar, Larius, and the dumbest of all, the halfwit Ignus, bastard son of Momon and the brainless He-demon. Curse you, Momon, queen of all that is evil and not very good in bed. And I'm not just saying that because she dumped me.   Yes, I was once her consort. I was blinded by love, and later, scorpion venom.  I'm blind!  But Momon has one weakness. She put too much of her power into this. The generalissimo of dice. 
Titanius Anglesmith: Well, bite my shiny metal face. 
Greyfarn: Don't be foolish, Titanius. If you had paid attention in freshman alchemy, instead of frequenting the bawdyhouse, you'd know there's only one way to destroy it. In the boiling plastic from which it was molded.
",857,83,5,11,Leegola,Frydo17443,Frydo," Like that machine that makes wax lions at the zoo.
",52,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Greyfarn17444,Greyfarn," Quiet, you. We must infiltrate the Geysers of Gygax, the impenetrable stronghold of Momon.
",92,83,5,11,Frydo,Titanius Anglesmith17445,Titanius Anglesmith," Impossible. Impossible, I say.
",32,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Greyfarn17446,Greyfarn," No, Titanius. For we maintain one advantage, the element of surprise. 
Titanius Anglesmith: Verily, our quest has begun.
",122,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Hermaphrodite17447,Hermaphrodite," Stop right there.
",19,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Frydo17448,Frydo," Hermes?
",9,83,5,11,Hermaphrodite,Leegola17449,Leegola," He's a centaur like me.
",25,83,5,11,Frydo,Frydo17450,Frydo," You wish.
",11,83,5,11,Leegola,Hermaphrodite17451,Hermaphrodite," I am Hermaphrodite, most beautiful of centaurs. Gaze upon me and weep at my loveliness.
",89,83,5,11,Frydo,Greyfarn17452,Greyfarn," Very well.
",12,83,5,11,Hermaphrodite,Titanius Anglesmith17453,Titanius Anglesmith," Loveliest of centaurs, we seek to end Momon's reign of evil. Have you stout fighters at your command?
",103,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Hermaphrodite17454,Hermaphrodite," One thousand archers of truest aim.  Fire!
",44,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Titanius Anglesmith17455,Titanius Anglesmith," Hey guys, I forgot I had this pumpkin. 
Leegola: I knew it. My people are mighty warriors. Our enemies will be like Swiss cheese with blood coming out of the holes.
",166,83,5,11,Hermaphrodite,Female Centaur17456,Female Centaur," We centaurs are creatures of peace.
",37,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Leegola17457,Leegola," Oh, Lord.
",11,83,5,11,Female Centaur,Hermaphrodite17458,Hermaphrodite," Violence is never justified. We shall not join your quest. And furthermore, if mayhem be your intent, you may not cross our lands.
",132,83,5,11,Leegola,Leegola17459,Leegola," Or what?
",10,83,5,11,Hermaphrodite,Hermaphrodite17460,Hermaphrodite,"  Or... Uh... Mmm?
",19,83,5,11,Leegola,Greyfarn17461,Greyfarn," We're not there, we're here.
",30,83,5,11,Hermaphrodite,Titanius Anglesmith17462,Titanius Anglesmith," No, this way.
",15,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Greyfarn17463,Greyfarn," I mean, here.
",15,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Greyfarn17464,Greyfarn," Thank you, kindly, Treedledum.
",32,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Treedledum17465,Treedledum," Okey-doke. Anything else I can do?
",36,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Leegola17466,Leegola," You know who I'm gonna miss? That tree guy.
",45,83,5,11,Treedledum,Greyfarn17467,Greyfarn," Bad news, fancy men. Momon's guards stand watch at the pass. 'Tis as if she somehow anticipated us.
",101,83,5,11,Leegola,Titanius Anglesmith17468,Titanius Anglesmith," And so our quest comes to an end. I only regret not giving up sooner.
",71,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Greyfarn17469,Greyfarn," Fret not, Titanius. For we still have one hope, the Cave of Hopelessness.
",75,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Titanius Anglesmith17470,Titanius Anglesmith," Let me know how that turns out.
",33,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Ogre17471,Ogre," Halt. Are you on the list? I'm not seeing you on the list.
",60,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Leegola17472,Leegola," I'll split this doofus in half.
",33,83,5,11,Ogre,Titanius Anglesmith17473,Titanius Anglesmith," Wait, I got it. Yeah. My cousin's in the band. The band of merry men. Please, we were already in there. I just need to go back for my coat.
",141,83,5,11,Leegola,Gynecaladriel17474,Gynecaladriel," I am Gynecaladriel, queen of the water nymphos.
",49,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Leegola17475,Leegola," All right. I'll split this doofus in half.
",44,83,5,11,Gynecaladriel,Gynecaladriel17476,Gynecaladriel," Stand aside and I will use my powers to overwhelm the guard.  Behold, the deed is done.
",89,83,5,11,Leegola,Titanius Anglesmith17477,Titanius Anglesmith," Hi oh!
",8,83,5,11,Gynecaladriel,Frydo17478,Frydo," Mr. Wizard, why is this place called the Cave of Hopelessness?
",64,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Greyfarn17479,Greyfarn," Oh, fear not, lad. 'Tis named for its discoverer, Reginald Hopelessness...
",76,83,5,11,Frydo,Frydo17480,Frydo," Whew!
",7,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Greyfarn17481,Greyfarn," ...the first man to be eaten alive by the Tunneling Horror.
",61,83,5,11,Frydo,Frydo17482,Frydo," What's that? The Tunneling Horror?
",36,83,5,11,Greyfarn,Gynecaladriel17483,Gynecaladriel," No, it's morcs.
",17,83,5,11,Frydo,Morcs17484,Morcs," Hey, listen. Nanu, nanu. Shazbot.
",35,83,5,11,Gynecaladriel,Titanius Anglesmith17485,Titanius Anglesmith," Oh, God, no. They're so aggravating.
",38,83,5,11,Morcs,Morcs17486,Morcs," Oh, fantastic. Nanu, nanu. Reality, what a concept. Fantastic.  Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
",86,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Gynecaladriel17487,Gynecaladriel," Shut up! Shut up!
",19,83,5,11,Morcs,Morcs17488,Morcs," Oh, fantastic. Oh, fantastic. Oh, wonderful.
",46,83,5,11,Gynecaladriel,Frydo17489,Frydo," Maybe it'll go away if we just don't laugh at it.
",51,83,5,11,Morcs,Titanius Anglesmith17490,Titanius Anglesmith," It doesn't.
",13,83,5,11,Frydo,Morcs17491,Morcs," Nanu, nanu.  Oh, shazbot. 
Frydo: Well, at least we didn't have to face the tunneling whatchimacallit.  Uh-oh.
",112,83,5,11,Titanius Anglesmith,Zoidberg17492,Zoidberg," Enough already with the banging and the swashbuckling.
",56,83,5,11,Morcs,Leegola17493,Leegola," Oh, I'm gonna enjoy killing you. 
Zoidberg: Watch where you're shooting that thing.  Again? What, am I talking to myself over here?
",133,83,5,11,Zoidberg,Leegola17494,Leegola," Mutilate! 
Zoidberg: Okay. Now, I'm getting a little mad even.
",64,83,5,11,Leegola,Leegola17495,Leegola," I'll kill you and eat your heart, you abomination. 
Zoidberg:  Don't make me laugh. The very idea that removing only one of my two hearts could... Hey, what are you doing down there?  Now, I'm dead. 
Frydo: Leela, it's over. You killed him enough.
",249,83,5,11,Leegola,Leegola17496,Leegola," I'm not taking any chances with the Tunneling Horror.
",55,83,5,11,Leegola,Zoidberg17497,Zoidberg," What? I'm not the Tunneling Horror. I hate that guy. Always with the tunneling. Anyway, I'm dead. 
Leegola: So, you're just an innocent monster. Oh, God. What have I done?
",173,83,5,11,Leegola,Zoidberg17498,Zoidberg," Oh! There he goes again.
",26,83,5,11,Zoidberg,Mom17499,Mom," Previously, on Futurama. 
",27,84,5,12,Zoidberg,Fry17500,Fry," Bender, I think you might be  playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
",68,84,5,12,Mom,Bender17501,Bender," I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
",50,84,5,12,Fry,Younger Mom17502,Younger Mom," A new super fuel, eh?
",23,84,5,12,Bender,Mom17503,Mom," If the crystals get within six inches of each other...  Wham! All my dark matter will be worthless.
",101,84,5,12,Younger Mom,Mom17504,Mom," Give me the anti-backwards crystal.
",37,84,5,12,Mom,Farnsworth17505,Farnsworth," Never! 
Titanius Anglesmith: Welcome to Cornwood!
",51,84,5,12,Mom,Frydo17506,Frydo," What's happening? And why am I enjoying it so much?
",53,84,5,12,Farnsworth,Leegola17507,Leegola," I'm not taking any chances with the Tunneling Horror.
",55,84,5,12,Frydo,Zoidberg17508,Zoidberg," I'm not the Tunneling Horror.
Titanius Anglesmith: The Tunneling Horror! 
Frydo: Why aren't you killing it, Leela? You love killing.
",134,84,5,12,Leegola,Leegola17509,Leegola," No, no more killing.
",22,84,5,12,Zoidberg,Zoidberg17510,Zoidberg," Oh! So, suddenly, Miss Goody Four-shoes over here doesn't kill anymore. She killed me not five minutes ago. What am I? Chopped liver?
",135,84,5,12,Leegola,Leegola17511,Leegola," Shut up. 
Zoidberg: Ow! Stop chopping my liver.
",49,84,5,12,Zoidberg,Leegola17512,Leegola," You're on your own.  I refuse to hurt another living thing. 
Frydo: All right. I may be weak and I may be small, but I don't see how I can possibly destroy that monster. Guess I'll just huck whatever's in my pockets at him. At least I can say I tried.
",253,84,5,12,Leegola,Titanius Anglesmith17513,Titanius Anglesmith," Any time now.
",15,84,5,12,Leegola,Frydo17514,Frydo," The Die of Power. I forgot to remember to roll it.
",52,84,5,12,Titanius Anglesmith,Die of Power17515,Die of Power," Three.
",8,84,5,12,Frydo,Frydo17516,Frydo," ""Grow?"" I don't see anything growing. Everything is getting smaller.  Ow. Wait a second. I'm big! In your face, everyone from middle school especially Jeremy.  Wow, that was intense. You guys got to try the Die of Power.
",222,84,5,12,Die of Power,Titanius Anglesmith17517,Titanius Anglesmith," I'll take a hit.
",18,84,5,12,Frydo,Frydo17518,Frydo," Hands off the dodecalicious. 
Greyfarn: Beware, Frydo. Don't be seduced. Hang on a second.  Resist the allure of the die. For to defeat Momon, we must melt it in the super bombastic, bubbling plastic from whence it came.
",222,84,5,12,Titanius Anglesmith,Greyfarn17519,Greyfarn," We must melt it in the super bombastic, bubbling plastic from whence it came.
",79,84,5,12,Frydo,Momon17520,Momon," I send you to kill them and they're not even maimed? That's what I get for sending boys to do a mom's job.
",108,84,5,12,Greyfarn,Larius17521,Larius," Sorry, Mom.
",13,84,5,12,Momon,Momon17522,Momon," Sorry doesn't put heads on my table. Peaches.  You're up.
",59,84,5,12,Larius,Ignus17523,Ignus," I like this part but I don't like...
",38,84,5,12,Momon,Centaur Opponent17524,Centaur Opponent," You are an able opponent, Hermaphrodite. But hear me well when I posit that we must abhor violence in all its forms.
",118,84,5,12,Ignus,Hermaphrodite17525,Hermaphrodite," I offer a dissenting opinion.
",31,84,5,12,Centaur Opponent,All17526,All," 
Hermaphrodite: For abhorring violence is itself an act of violence and, therefore, to be abhorred.  All bow before mighty Hermaphrodite.  Ah! Don't hurt me.
",159,84,5,12,Hermaphrodite,Leegola17527,Leegola," I'm not here to hurt you. Or anything ever again. Please, teach me the centaurs' ways of wimpiness.
",101,84,5,12,All,Hermaphrodite17528,Hermaphrodite," What do you offer in return?
",30,84,5,12,Leegola,Titanius Anglesmith17529,Titanius Anglesmith," Yes! We made it out of that godforsaken cave. Now, what's the fastest way home? Back through the cave?  Ow!  Ow!
",114,84,5,12,Hermaphrodite,Greyfarn17530,Greyfarn," We're close now, my friends. So close, I can practically feel the heat of the fiery molten plastic.
",101,84,5,12,Titanius Anglesmith,Gynecaladriel17531,Gynecaladriel," You're standing in the fire.
",30,84,5,12,Greyfarn,Greyfarn17532,Greyfarn," Oh, my.  Alas, our path is blocked by Momon's army of evil. As well as her navy of moral dubiousness.
",103,84,5,12,Gynecaladriel,Titanius Anglesmith17533,Titanius Anglesmith," Mayhaps we might raise an army of our own. We're but an hour's ride from Wipe Castle.
",87,84,5,12,Greyfarn,Greyfarn17534,Greyfarn," Of course. Wipe Castle. And while we're there, we can get some of those greasy little dwarf burgers.
",102,84,5,12,Titanius Anglesmith,Gynecaladriel17535,Gynecaladriel," Ooh! I love those. You can eat like eight of them without gaining any weight because of all the diarrhea.
",107,84,5,12,Greyfarn,Greyfarn17536,Greyfarn," Sleep deep, fair snoozles. At dawn, we ride for Wipe Castle.  Quiet, Frydo. 
Momon: We've got them now. Send all our forces against Wipe Castle.
",146,84,5,12,Gynecaladriel,Waltazar17537,Waltazar," Right away, Mother. I'll just leave a small contingent behind in case...
",74,84,5,12,Greyfarn,Momon17538,Momon," I said, everything. Peaches!
",30,84,5,12,Waltazar,Peaches17539,Peaches," I'm in the tub.
",17,84,5,12,Momon,Momon17540,Momon," Waltazar, you and Larius shall lead the assault.
",50,84,5,12,Peaches,Waltazar17541,Waltazar," What about Ignus?
",19,84,5,12,Momon,Momon17542,Momon," I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission. You see, there is a terrible secret about Ignus I've never told anyone. And here it is.

We'll still cruise the cool casinos.
You'll still fly me to the moon,
Although the moon to which you fly me,
Could be Phobos or Deimos.
The psychic worms from Rigel Nine,
Who control everything we do,
Will make us think that was then,
And 3010 is exactly the same as 1962.

",57,85,5,13,Hutch Waterfall,Hutch Waterfall17708,Hutch Waterfall," Never mind that. Just keep the foil on and you'll be okay. Also, it'll keep the Dark Ones from incinerating your brain.
",121,85,5,13,Fry,Fry17709,Fry," That's a plus.
",16,85,5,13,Hutch Waterfall,Hutch Waterfall17710,Hutch Waterfall," And don't ever, ever, ever tell anyone you can read minds, or the Dark Ones will get you like that.  Hang on, pizza grease. Like that. 
",137,85,5,13,Fry,Clamps17711,Clamps," I'd like to get my clamps on those. Give her a jump, you know what I mean?  
",78,85,5,13,Hutch Waterfall,Donbot17712,Donbot," Whoa, whoa. Show some decorum there, Clamps. This ain't no strip show. This is a beguiling display of the pornographic arts.
",126,85,5,13,Clamps,Joey Mousepad17713,Joey Mousepad," Yo, Skip, I can see a guy's butt.
",35,85,5,13,Donbot,Michaels Wife17714,Michaels Wife," Oh, Michael, this is the perfect end to a perfect honeymoon.
",62,85,5,13,Joey Mousepad,Michael17715,Michael," I love you so much.
",21,85,5,13,Michaels Wife,Bender17716,Bender," Is this seat taken?
",21,85,5,13,Michael,Michael17717,Michael," Actually, we...
",17,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17718,Bender," Slide me those chicken wings. So what part of Podunk you rubes from?
",70,85,5,13,Michael,Michael17719,Michael," The north-eastern.
",20,85,5,13,Bender,Announcer #117720,Announcer #1," Monsieurs et mademoiselles, our circus of the senses now arrives by steamboat in New Orleans, circa 2873. The muted lament of a trombone resonates through the fog, which lingers even now, months after the attack of the fog monster. With but one hope of restoring Gearoticus to his throne, our sensual fate rests in the gyrations of... Fanny.
",343,85,5,13,Michael,Bender17721,Bender," Oh. 
",6,85,5,13,Announcer #1,Fanny17722,Fanny," Yes?
",6,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17723,Bender," I'm Bender. Let's do it.  
",28,85,5,13,Fanny,Donbot17724,Donbot," Who is it, the Feds?
",22,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17725,Bender,"  Aren't you the Donbot, head of the Robot Mafia?
",50,85,5,13,Donbot,Donbot17726,Donbot," Allegedly. And this is my beloved wife, Fanny, whose honor I would proudly defend with a power drill. Well, I gotta go drown a stoolie.
",137,85,5,13,Bender,Donbot17727,Donbot," I'm gonna be in here a while, so do me a favor and drive my wife home. It's one of them self-driving cars, so just sit in the back and do whatever.
",149,85,5,13,Donbot,Fanny17728,Fanny," Oh, Bender, your lips are intoxicating. It's like kissing an ashtray full of hot wings.
",89,85,5,13,Donbot,Bender17729,Bender," Aww yeahh!
",12,85,5,13,Fanny,Fry17730,Fry," My God, I really can read minds. I have a superpower! There must be something great I can do with this.
",105,85,5,13,Bender,Fry17731,Fry," Hello, ladies, I can read your thoughts.  Oh, wait, that's invisibility.
",74,85,5,13,Fry,Fry17732,Fry," Poker. With my mind-reading abilities and my invisibility... Wait, no, just the mind reading. I can't lose!
",109,85,5,13,Fry,Fry17733,Fry," Sign me up for the tournament, please.
",40,85,5,13,Fry,Administrator17734,Administrator," Okey-doke, Jiffy Pop. Entry fee's 50,000 smackers.
",52,85,5,13,Fry,Fry17735,Fry," 50,000? Drat, all I have is my life savings and a token for free admission to this poker tournament.
",102,85,5,13,Administrator,Administrator17736,Administrator," Close enough. 
",16,85,5,13,Fry,Amy17737,Amy," You're having an affair with the head of the robot mafia's wife?
",66,85,5,13,Administrator,Bender17738,Bender," Yup, this is her I'm making out with.
",39,85,5,13,Amy,Hermes17739,Hermes," Bender, are you crazy?
",24,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17740,Bender," No, it's Fry who's crazy in this one.
",39,85,5,13,Hermes,Fry17741,Fry," Psht, I'm not crazy.
",22,85,5,13,Bender,Leela17742,Leela," You sure you're okay, Fry? You do have tin foil on your head.
",63,85,5,13,Fry,Fry17743,Fry," So? You've got a leech on your neck. Oh, and speaking of sucking on your neck, want to go to a movie later?
",109,85,5,13,Leela,Elzar17744,Elzar," Hey, there! How are you folks doing tonight?
",46,85,5,13,Fry,Bender17745,Bender," Great. What are the specials?
",31,85,5,13,Elzar,Elzar17746,Elzar," We've got a wonderful grizzly bear that's been dipped in cornmeal and lightly tormented. Questions?
",101,85,5,13,Bender,Amy17747,Amy," What was the bear's name?
",27,85,5,13,Elzar,Elzar17748,Elzar," Jojo.
",7,85,5,13,Amy,Amy17749,Amy," Ooh, I'll have him.
",21,85,5,13,Elzar,Bender17750,Bender," Hide me!
",10,85,5,13,Amy,Joey Mousepad17751,Joey Mousepad," Hey, Donbot, ain't that your wife what with you had that wedding with?
",72,85,5,13,Bender,Fanny17752,Fanny,"  Donbot, honey! What a pleasant shock! I was just having dinner alone, when suddenly you walk in on us.
",105,85,5,13,Joey Mousepad,Donbot17753,Donbot," Alone, huh?
",13,85,5,13,Fanny,Bender17754,Bender," Where am I? I was exploring a wormhole through space many light years from this restaurant, when suddenly I was surrounded by darkness.  Hot, sexy darkness.  Oh, why, hello, Donbot! Hello, miss, have we met?  I'm Bender. The world's most sexual robot. I mean, the world's most boundary-respecting robot.
",305,85,5,13,Donbot,Donbot17755,Donbot," Nice to see you, Bender. Welcome back to our universe. Listen, sugar, I stuck up the Burlington Coat Factory and got you a little something. It's a $49 value.
",160,85,5,13,Bender,Danny17756,Danny," Donbot, I love you!  Not really.
",34,85,5,13,Donbot,Bender17757,Bender," Man, this is great! I always wanted to nail a dame in a fur coat, and now's my chance.  I mean, if you'll introduce me to one, sir.  One as sexy as you, baby! Bender out. 
",173,85,5,13,Danny,Fanny17758,Fanny," I never felt so alive, Bender. Listen, this turquoise-encrusted bra is worth 50 grand. Let's sell it and run off before the Donbot gets wise.
",143,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17759,Bender,"  No. It will take a lot more money than that to make a girl like you happy.
",77,85,5,13,Fanny,Fanny17760,Fanny," No, it won't.
",15,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17761,Bender," Yeah, it will. Shut up! We'll run off, after I win the Universal Poker Championship!  One entry, please.
",106,85,5,13,Fanny,Fanny17762,Fanny," Bender, no! You're not lucky enough.
",38,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17763,Bender," Oh, no? I'm 40% lucky.  The scrap metal I'm made from included a truckload of horseshoes from the luckiest racehorses in Mexico, who had just been sent to a glue factory.
",172,85,5,13,Fanny,Fanny17764,Fanny," They don't sound so lucky to me.
",34,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17765,Bender," Not without their shoes.
",26,85,5,13,Fanny,Fanny17766,Fanny," Here, Bendy, take this. It will give you 70% more luck. It's the Donbot's lucky robot's foot.
",95,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17767,Bender," All right! With two kinds of luck, I can't lose.
",50,85,5,13,Fanny,Bender17768,Bender," No, wait, three. I stepped on a leprechaun.
",45,85,5,13,Bender,Joey Mousepad17769,Joey Mousepad," Yo, you see this over here over there?
",40,85,5,13,Bender,Clamps17770,Clamps," I'm powering up the clamps.
",29,85,5,13,Joey Mousepad,Donbot17771,Donbot," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let us not rush to judgement.
",49,85,5,13,Clamps,Joey Mousepad17772,Joey Mousepad," But, Skip, that was your lucky robot's foot what came off of your lucky leg.
",78,85,5,13,Donbot,Donbot17773,Donbot,"  While it is true that I did wake up with only one foot this morning, there is no proof that my beloved Fanny was involved. Aside from the hacksaw I found under her pillow.
",174,85,5,13,Joey Mousepad,Clamps17774,Clamps," Well, what about that Bender guy? You want I should give him the clamps?
",74,85,5,13,Donbot,Donbot17775,Donbot," Not yet, Clamps. We are gonna sit tight and see if he wins the poker tournament. He does, that proves he's packing my lucky foot, in which event...
",149,85,5,13,Clamps,Clamps17776,Clamps," The clamps! Or a clamp-like device.
",37,85,5,13,Donbot,Penn Jillette17777,Penn Jillette," Welcome viewers who fell asleep with the TV on! It's the 3009 no-limit hold 'em championship.  I'm the massive head of Penn Jillette, and here with a color commentary, my partner Teller.  Our act really didn't change much when he died.
",237,85,5,13,Clamps,Bender17778,Bender," Pardon me, I'm new to this game. Is this duffle bag big enough for all your money? 
",85,85,5,13,Penn Jillette,Fry17779,Fry,"  Bender? Oh, boogers. We're in the same tournament. Quick, get your entry fee back before I bankrupt you.
",107,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17780,Bender," Pfft! In your dreams, nutloaf.
",32,85,5,13,Fry,Fry17781,Fry," Bite my shiny metal hat.
",26,85,5,13,Bender,Penn Jillette17782,Penn Jillette," Tex Connecticut, the pride of Kansas City, first to act.  Smiley Spiff, up next.  Looks like Boobs Vanderbilt has a decent pair. Also, she's got two eights.  And Bender Rodriguez picks up a lucky deal right off the bat. 
",222,85,5,13,Fry,Bender17783,Bender," Woo! Two aces. I'm thinking guitar solo. 
",43,85,5,13,Penn Jillette,Fry17784,Fry," He puts his hat back down.] I fold.
",37,85,5,13,Bender,Penn Jillette17785,Penn Jillette," Holy crap! A stunning play by mentally ill newcomer Philip Fry. It's almost as if he knew Bender had two aces.
",112,85,5,13,Fry,Boobs Vanderbilt17786,Boobs Vanderbilt," Bender has two aces? I'm out.
",31,85,5,13,Penn Jillette,Tex Connecticut17787,Tex Connecticut," I'm out.
",10,85,5,13,Boobs Vanderbilt,Lrrr17788,Lrrr," I'm out.
",10,85,5,13,Tex Connecticut,Bender17789,Bender,"  Suck my luck!
",16,85,5,13,Lrrr,Donbot17790,Donbot," See this gun?  That's what I'm gonna do to Bender if he wins.
",63,85,5,13,Bender,Lrrr17791,Lrrr," All in. Call my mighty bid at your peril.  : My cards are awful, and I need a hug.
",84,85,5,13,Donbot,Fry17792,Fry," I call your bluff.
",20,85,5,13,Lrrr,Lrrr17793,Lrrr," I shall annihilate... Fry hugs him.]  I just wanted to make my daddy proud.
",77,85,5,13,Fry,Lrrrs Father17794,Lrrrs Father," Well, you didn't. I want you and your junk moved out by Monday.
",65,85,5,13,Lrrr,Penn Jillette17795,Penn Jillette," It's getting pretty intense, folks. Based on the state of decomposition of Teller's head, we're now in hour 19 of the tournament. And the first bad deal of the night for Bender.
",179,85,5,13,Lrrrs Father,Bender17796,Bender," Hey, pal, help me out here.  This is the worst possible hand, right?
",70,85,5,13,Penn Jillette,Tex Connecticut17797,Tex Connecticut," I'm all in.
",13,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17798,Bender," All in! I mean, fold. Whatever.
",33,85,5,13,Tex Connecticut,Penn Jillette17799,Penn Jillette,"  Well, Bender's luck just ran out. No card can save him from elimination.
",75,85,5,13,Bender,Boobs Vanderbilt17800,Boobs Vanderbilt," Oh, my gourds! He's dead. 
",28,85,5,13,Penn Jillette,Leo Wong17801,Leo Wong," 21, winner! 
",14,85,5,13,Boobs Vanderbilt,Bender17802,Bender," Wooo! I'm so full of luck, it's shooting out like luck diarrhoea.
",67,85,5,13,Leo Wong,Penn Jillette17803,Penn Jillette," Wake up, poker fans! We're down to our final two players in heads-up action for the Championship. Your perspective, Teller? 
",126,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17804,Bender," All in.
",9,85,5,13,Penn Jillette,Fry17805,Fry," But-but, you didn't even look at your cards!
",46,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17806,Bender," Looking at one's cards is a crutch for players who rely on skill.
",67,85,5,13,Fry,Leo Wong17807,Leo Wong," Any day now, Fry. You in or out?
",34,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17808,Bender," What's the matter, Fry, you scared? Or just  crazy? 
",54,85,5,13,Leo Wong,Fry17809,Fry," All right, all in.  Yes! Four aces!
",37,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17810,Bender,"  Ah-ah-ah. Read 'em and weep, and then tell me what they are.
",63,85,5,13,Fry,Leo Wong17811,Leo Wong," Two kings. And with three on the board, that gives Bender five kings.
",71,85,5,13,Bender,Fry17812,Fry," But how is that...
",20,85,5,13,Leo Wong,Penn Jillette17813,Penn Jillette," I don't believe it. Bender has just been dealt the King of Beers, a coaster from the bar that somehow got mixed into the deck. But it still counts!
",149,85,5,13,Fry,Leo Wong17814,Leo Wong," Bender win the Championship!
",30,85,5,13,Penn Jillette,Bender17815,Bender,"  That's some good money. 
",27,85,5,13,Leo Wong,Fanny17816,Fanny,"  You did it, Bender. You're the greatest.
",43,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17817,Bender," Tell me something I don't know, sweetass. Now, let's boogie. We'll be in Space Tahiti before the Donbot knows what hit him.
",125,85,5,13,Fanny,Donbot17818,Donbot," Now I am suspicious.
",22,85,5,13,Bender,Bender17819,Bender," Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave. Can we go now?
",62,85,5,13,Donbot,Hermesand Zoidberg17820,Hermesand Zoidberg," Previously, on Futurama. 
",27,86,5,14,Bender,Hutch Waterfall17821,Hutch Waterfall," You need one of these doodangs.  
",35,86,5,14,Hermesand Zoidberg,Fry17822,Fry," A foil hat? 
",14,86,5,14,Hutch Waterfall,Hutch Waterfall17823,Hutch Waterfall," Truth is, you're a mind reader.
",33,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17824,Fry," Oh, my God!
",13,86,5,14,Hutch Waterfall,Amy17825,Amy," You're having an affair with the head of the robot mafia's wife? 
",67,86,5,14,Fry,Bender17826,Bender," Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave.
",47,86,5,14,Amy,Fry17827,Fry," Poor Bender left me one last voicemail before the Robot Mafia buried him in the desert.
",89,86,5,14,Bender,Bender17828,Bender," Fry, old friend, before I die, I just wanted to say...  Hang on, I'm getting another call. Hello? 
",100,86,5,14,Fry,Hermes17829,Hermes," Line up, people! Everyone take a shovel and one sixth of the planet. We'll meet back here in 50 years, our bodies broken and our lives wasted.
",144,86,5,14,Bender,Zoidberg17830,Zoidberg," And you say these are free shovels?
",37,86,5,14,Hermes,Bender17831,Bender," I'm back, baby.
",17,86,5,14,Zoidberg,Fry17832,Fry," Bender! I thought the Robot Mafia killed you.
",47,86,5,14,Bender,Bender17833,Bender," Nah, they just shot us and buried us a few times as a warning.
",64,86,5,14,Fry,Fanny17834,Fanny," Bender was so brave. He never stopped making out with me the whole time they were shooting us.
",96,86,5,14,Bender,Bender17835,Bender," I sure didn't.
",16,86,5,14,Fanny,Fanny17836,Fanny," I gotta get back to my husband, baby. Will I see you tonight?
",63,86,5,14,Bender,Bender17837,Bender," Probably not.
",15,86,5,14,Fanny,Leo17838,Leo," It's a 14-footer with a clown hazard. What club you recommend, Baggy?
",71,86,5,14,Bender,Baggy17839,Baggy," As on every hole, I suggest the putter.
",41,86,5,14,Leo,Fry17840,Fry," Your golf club sure is classy, Mr. Wong. Naked statue classy.
",63,86,5,14,Baggy,Leela17841,Leela," It is very nice. I just wish Amy and I didn't have to wear these sexist badges on our melons. 
",96,86,5,14,Fry,Amy17842,Amy," We're lucky even to play as guests, Leela. Dad's club has a very strict ""No girls allowed"" policy.
",100,86,5,14,Leela,Leela17843,Leela," That doesn't seem fair.
",25,86,5,14,Amy,Amy17844,Amy," It really is. Everybody knows women don't have the focus to play miniature golf at a professional level.
",106,86,5,14,Leela,Leela17845,Leela," But that's the best shot of the day!
",38,86,5,14,Amy,Leo17846,Leo," Is that my ball? I think that my ball.
",40,86,5,14,Leela,Amy17847,Amy," Pfft, great putt, Dad.
",24,86,5,14,Leo,Leo17848,Leo," Okay, we're done.
",19,86,5,14,Amy,Leela17849,Leela," Mr. Wong, how do you keep this place so green in the middle of the desert? Doesn't that waste a lot of water?
",111,86,5,14,Leo,Leo17850,Leo," Nah, we got plenty water, pumped directly from flamingo lake.  They'll be fine. 
",82,86,5,14,Leela,Leo17851,Leo," Oh, yeah, I love miniature golf. Love everything about it, except how damn miniature it is. That's why I'm building the universe's biggest miniature golf course.
",163,86,5,14,Leo,Leo17852,Leo," This the first tee.
",21,86,5,14,Leo,Fry17853,Fry," Where's the hole?
",19,86,5,14,Leo,Leo17854,Leo," On Pluto's moon, Hydra. It's a six-billion-mile par-two. Tough shot, even for a man.  : Around the sun. Bank off Jupiter. And right into the...  I'll be right back.  It dropped in! Put me down for a two.
",205,86,5,14,Fry,Amy17855,Amy," Two. 
",7,86,5,14,Leo,Leo17856,Leo," Keep in mind, that just the first hole. For full course, we gonna bulldoze this entire arm of the Milky Way.
",110,86,5,14,Amy,Leela17857,Leela," What? You're gonna wipe out 10% of the galaxy for a stupid golf course?
",73,86,5,14,Leo,Leo17858,Leo," First of all, it 12% . Second, yes, you betcha.
",49,86,5,14,Leela,Leela17859,Leela," But you have no idea what life forms might be evolving out there.
",67,86,5,14,Leo,Leo17860,Leo," That's exactly why I'm hiring an impartial scientist to perform an environmental survey. That's him in the money shower.
",122,86,5,14,Leela,Fry17861,Fry," Delivery boy's log. Having fallen asleep on what I thought was the toilet, I awoke to find the environmental survey in progress.
",130,86,5,14,Leo,Farnsworth17862,Farnsworth," Status reports, Science Officer.
",34,86,5,14,Fry,Bender17863,Bender," Zilcho. No sign of life or intelligence.  : Just like Fry on a date.
",70,86,5,14,Farnsworth,Fry17864,Fry,"  Hey!
",7,86,5,14,Bender,Leela17865,Leela," Okay, so we haven't found any life yet. I still don't see why you men can't be happy with regular-sized miniature golf.
",121,86,5,14,Fry,Farnsworth17866,Farnsworth," Leela, evolution has programmed our fabulous male brains to take anything anybody else thinks is important and make it bigger.  Have you seen my new 301-inch TV?
",163,86,5,14,Leela,Announcer #117867,Announcer #1," Hypnotoad is brought to you by the MagnaPhallix 302-inch TV. It's bigger!
",75,86,5,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17868,Farnsworth," Oh, hell! 
",12,86,5,14,Announcer #1,Bender17869,Bender,"  Captain, I'm detecting life on the Spock-o-scope!
",52,86,5,14,Farnsworth,Leela17870,Leela," It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
",50,86,5,14,Bender,Fry17871,Fry," Except in Kansas.
",19,86,5,14,Leela,Bender17872,Bender," But isn't Mr. Wong building the 18th hole here? And the golf pants museum?
",76,86,5,14,Fry,Farnsworth17873,Farnsworth," Indeed so. This whole area will be incinerated when he implodes that sun there into a black hole.
",99,86,5,14,Bender,Leela17874,Leela," That beautiful violet star?
",29,86,5,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth17875,Farnsworth," It's so you can't keep your ball at the end of the game.
",58,86,5,14,Leela,Fry17876,Fry," Yo, that's messed up.
",23,86,5,14,Farnsworth,Leela17877,Leela," There won't be any imploding once they read our environmental review. Right, Professor?
",89,86,5,14,Fry,Farnsworth17878,Farnsworth," Ohh, twaddle-squat. There's no scientific consensus that life is important.
",77,86,5,14,Leela,Bender17879,Bender," Yeah. Life, schmife.

",60,86,5,14,Nixon,Nixon17902,Nixon," My fellow Earthicans, these eco-crooks will face the maximum sentence. For killing a headless torso, that's six weeks.
",120,86,5,14,Frida,Bender17903,Bender," Well, this is embarrassing. Here I've been blabbing on for years about killing all humans, and who actually does something about it? Some chick.
",146,86,5,14,Nixon,Fry17904,Fry," Leela's not a killer, and she's not some chick. She's the chick I love. And don't tell her I called her a chick, or she'll kill me.

",62,86,5,14,Trixie,Leela17917,Leela," That's crazy. We've done nothing wrong, other than killing and dismembering the vice-president. We need to make a choice, sisters. We can either keep pestering criminals like Leo Wong with silly slogans...
",207,86,5,14,Dixie,All17918,All," Yeah. Let's do that.
",22,86,5,14,Leela,Leela17919,Leela," Actually, I meant that to be the less preferable alternative. We can either chant slogans or we can take action.
",114,86,5,14,All,Dixie17920,Dixie," What was the first choice again?

",87,86,5,14,Dixie,Frida17922,Frida," Could we still use our bullhorns?
",35,86,5,14,Leela,Leela17923,Leela," Absolutely. Bullhorns are a core principle of eco-feminism.

",55,86,5,14,Dixie,Leo17930,Leo," Those dirty rings. I tried soaking them out, even blasting them out.
",70,86,5,14,Leela,Frida17931,Frida," Are you sure about this? It would be better for propaganda if we weren't using refined sugar.
",95,86,5,14,Leo,Leela17932,Leela," It's okay. The potato we're shoving in the tailpipe is organic.
",65,86,5,14,Frida,Leo17933,Leo," I smell sabotage.  Ooh, and potatoes.
",39,86,5,14,Leela,Leela17934,Leela," Now, unfortunately, the media is going to put a negative spin on this, like when we killed that guy, so to win public support, we'll need a lovable mascot.

",22,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17941,Fry," I know. I miss you so much, Leela, even more than when you were here.
",71,86,5,14,Leela,Leela17942,Leela," I miss you, too, Fry. And you probably think what I'm doing is wrong. But it's something I really care about...
",113,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17943,Fry," You don't have to explain, Leela. You're you. That's all I need to know.
",74,86,5,14,Leela,Leela17944,Leela," Goodbye, sweet goofbag.
",25,86,5,14,Fry,Bender17945,Bender,"Â : I'll miss her, too, buddy. Dibs on her iPod.

",39,86,5,14,Hutch Waterfall,Hutch Waterfall17949,Hutch Waterfall," Same old, same old. Searching the dumpsters, protecting my thoughts with tin foil, peeing myself.
",99,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17950,Fry," So, what brings you to Earth?
",31,86,5,14,Hutch Waterfall,Hutch Waterfall17951,Hutch Waterfall," It's top secret. Hey, take off your helmet and I'll think it to you.
",70,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17952,Fry," Okay. Here goes.
",18,86,5,14,Hutch Waterfall,Fry17953,Fry," Where are you? And me?
",24,86,5,14,Fry,Hutch Waterfall17954,Hutch Waterfall," The Great Hall of the Ancient Legion of Madfellows. Welcome, bro.

",15,86,5,14,Hutch Waterfall,Hutch Waterfall17956,Hutch Waterfall," Sorry I bashed your head in, buddy, but I had to. You see, the fate of the universe depends on you.
",101,86,5,14,All,Fry17957,Fry," Yeah, I get that a lot.
",25,86,5,14,Hutch Waterfall,Hutch Waterfall17958,Hutch Waterfall," The Grand Curator will tell you more.
",39,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17959,Fry," Take me to him.
",17,86,5,14,Hutch Waterfall,Nine17960,Nine," Hey, man.
",11,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17961,Fry," Hey.
",6,86,5,14,Nine,Nine17962,Nine," So dig this, Fry. Our commune has been monitoring the universe's life energy for, like, a really long time, and we're grokking some super weird junk.
",151,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17963,Fry," Um, I don't mean to be rude, but it's kind of hard to take you seriously when you say junk like ""grok"" and ""junk.""
",116,86,5,14,Nine,NineÂ 17964,NineÂ ," What about ""commune""?
",23,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17965,Fry," Especially ""commune."" Come on, it's the fate of the universe, puff it up a little. Like you could say your ancient order is sensing deep upheaval in the cosmic life energy field.
",180,86,5,14,NineÂ ,Nine17966,Nine," Okay. I'll try. So, like, a really, really long time ago...  Eons ago!  Cool. Eons ago, the life force we call Chee permeated the universe.  The Green Chee generated a great upwelling of life across the cosmos. But then, for reasons unknown...
",245,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17967,Fry," Ooh. ""Reasons unknown."" Now that's the sort of hook that grabs the attention of me, the viewer.
",97,86,5,14,Nine,Nine17968,Nine," For reasons unknown...
",24,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17969,Fry," Nice.
",7,86,5,14,Nine,Nine17970,Nine," ...the Chee began to recede, and the diversity of life began to wither. The life forms we know today are but a fraction of a fraction of the magnificence that once existed.
",174,86,5,14,Fry,Hutch Waterfall17971,Hutch Waterfall," But a bunch of dudes, right, they totally passed this far-out knowledge down through the ages.
",96,86,5,14,Nine,Nine17972,Nine," Some with this knowledge were called prophets, some, fruitcakes. We, the Legion of Madfellows, are their heirs.
",113,86,5,14,Hutch Waterfall,Fry17973,Fry," Hey, I'm on TV. 
",18,86,5,14,Nine,Nine17974,Nine," Well, that's the show. 
",25,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17975,Fry," Neat. What's it got to do with me?
",36,86,5,14,Nine,Nine17976,Nine," Ahh, pooperdoodle! I mean, pardon the omission. You see, after untold eternities, we have sensed a resurgence in the Chee.
",124,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17977,Fry," Hey, that's the violet dwarf star that Leela wants to save.
",61,86,5,14,Nine,Hutch Waterfall17978,Hutch Waterfall," Freaking nailed it, corndog.
",30,86,5,14,Fry,Nine17979,Nine," We believe this star heralds a new green age, and it's your destiny to be its shepherd and protector.
",103,86,5,14,Hutch Waterfall,Fry17980,Fry," Me? Why?
",10,86,5,14,Nine,Hutch Waterfall17981,Hutch Waterfall," 'Cause you got, like, no delta brainwave, man. The Dark Ones can't groove off your thoughts.
",94,86,5,14,Fry,Nine17982,Nine," Silence, Hutch! For now, let's just say we have enemies, enemies who can read minds, except yours. 
",101,86,5,14,Hutch Waterfall,Fry17983,Fry," Cool. I can't wait to tell Leela.
",35,86,5,14,Nine,Nine17984,Nine," No! If you tell anyone, then their thoughts could be read. For the sake of those you love, you must keep this secret. Do you foot-swear?
",138,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17985,Fry," Oh, okay. I foot-swear.
",25,86,5,14,Nine,Nine17986,Nine," Good. Now, to save the coming of the green age, you must stop this man.
",73,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17987,Fry," I know him. Leo Wong. I work with his daughter.
",49,86,5,14,Nine,Nine17988,Nine," Oh, good, that will cut about 15 minutes of explanation. You must gain Wong's confidence, infiltrate his organization and prevent him from destroying the violet dwarf.
",169,86,5,14,Fry,Leo17989,Leo," Looking for a job, eh?
",24,86,5,14,Nine,Fry17990,Fry," Yes, sir. Nothing fancy. I'm willing to start at the bottom and infiltrate my way up.
",87,86,5,14,Leo,Leo17991,Leo," Sorry, no openings right now. : What I need is security guard to keep nutcases out of my office.
",98,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17992,Fry," I'm good at keeping nutcases.
",31,86,5,14,Leo,Leo17993,Leo," I said no way. : This idiot don't look like he could handle those feministas.
",79,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17994,Fry," I look like an idiot who can handle those feministas.
",55,86,5,14,Leo,Leo17995,Leo," He'll have to do better than that.
",36,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17996,Fry," I'll have to do better than that.
",35,86,5,14,Leo,Leo17997,Leo," Hmm. You and I think a lot alike. You really think you can stand up to those eco-freakos?
",91,86,5,14,Fry,Fry17998,Fry," Sir, with me around, they'll be the least of your worries.
",60,86,5,14,Leo,Tester17999,Tester," Stand by, men. And manly aliens. Prepare to test fire King Kong hole.
",71,86,5,14,Fry,Sal18000,Sal," It workses.
",13,86,5,14,Tester,Tester18001,Tester," Good job, men. And manly aliens. Construction of King Kong hole complete.
",75,86,5,14,Sal,Frida18002,Frida," Typical. Always King Kong, never Queen... Quong.
",50,86,5,14,Tester,Sal18003,Sal," What are those, hooks? Get out of heres, you hookers.
",55,86,5,14,Frida,Sal18004,Sal,"  Helpses!

",19,86,5,14,Sal,Morbo18006,Morbo," Our top story. The string of eco-vandalism that began with a harmless vice-presidential killing has spread across the galaxy.
",127,86,5,14,Leela,Linda18007,Linda," Why do you always get to read the top story, Morbo?
",53,86,5,14,Morbo,Morbo18008,Morbo," Because viewers trust a deep male voice and huge, throbbing forehead veins. 
",78,86,5,14,Linda,Linda18009,Linda," Not all reaction to the crime spree has been negative. We spoke with several people who viewed these courageous eco-feminists as heroes.
",138,86,5,14,Morbo,Petunia18010,Petunia," I just wish there was some way to... Excuse me.  Some way to show I support 'em. Send them some smokes or something.
",118,86,5,14,Linda,Linda18011,Linda," This just in: Root 2 News has received a video communique from the eco-feminists' unknown hideout.

That's why we've adopted this parasite as our mascot.  I know it's a little confusing. The point is, even this vicious leech has a right to exist.

",9,87,5,15,Zapp,Nixon18035,Nixon," These eco-feminists are ruthless criminals who'll stop at nothing to save the environment. I don't see how a bending unit can catch them.

",55,87,5,15,Zapp,Bender18040,Bender," It's not about the money, Nixon, though I'd like much more. She's committed 30 felonies in 12 star systems. If no one stops her, she'll break my record for longest rap sheet.

",55,87,5,15,Bender,Bender18042,Bender," Gracias. Now, I could find Leela, but you'll need to authorize a wiretap.

",128,87,5,15,Nixon,Bender18047,Bender," Neat. Say, speaking of whatever the hell you just said, I need to make a cell phone telephone call. Can borrow your cell phone telephone?
",139,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18048,Fry," Okay, but don't restart my Tetris. I was finally about to get one of those pieces that looks like a backwards ""L.""

",18,87,5,15,Fry,Leo18050,Leo," Looking good, security. No feministas getting past you.
",57,87,5,15,Bender,Fry18051,Fry," No, sir. Not on my mustache's watch.
",38,87,5,15,Leo,Amy18052,Amy," Fry, I can't believe you're working with my dad against Leela. How can you claim to be her friend and still want her in jail?
",127,87,5,15,Fry,Leo18053,Leo," Don't mind cranky-pants here. She been cranky ever since she was a fat little girl.

",31,87,5,15,Leo,Amy18057,Amy," I knew you wanted a son! Why do you think I became a miniature golf champion? Why do you think I wear these stupid boys' sweat suits?

",42,87,5,15,Amy,Fry18059,Fry," Now, sir, in fairness, Amy's butt is actually pretty hot.
",59,87,5,15,Leo,Amy18060,Amy," What is it with you men? Why does everything revolve around my butt?
",70,87,5,15,Fry,Leo18061,Leo," 'Cause it's so big and massive. He and Fry share a laugh.]

",9,87,5,15,Bender,Bender18068,Bender," Oh! FYI, I dropped that Tetris piece in the wrong place and ended the game.
",77,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18069,Fry,"  No!
",6,87,5,15,Bender,Fry18070,Fry," Great! Now Amy's gonna tell Leela I'm a jerk. If only I could explain I'm on a secret mission against evil. Wait. Evil? Yeah, yeah, evil.  What's going on in there? A scary noise?  Hey, you're one of Leela's feministas. ""Save the environment! Wo-mandate Leo's retirement!"" That's terrible writing! Stop making your point so ineffectively! 
",341,87,5,15,Fry,Frida18071,Frida," Take your mands off of me!
",28,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18072,Fry,"  I'm on your side.
",20,87,5,15,Frida,Frida18073,Frida,"  Don't shush me.
",18,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18074,Fry," Please, can you take a message to Leela?
",42,87,5,15,Frida,Frida18075,Frida,"  What is it?
",14,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18076,Fry," Just say her sweet goofbag is working to save the violet dwarf star, just like she is.
",88,87,5,15,Frida,Frida18077,Frida," Very well, I'll fem-municate your man-formation.
",50,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18078,Fry,"  Just tell her.
",17,87,5,15,Frida,Farnsworth18079,Farnsworth," Well, this is it, old friends. Planet Express is done for, what with our delivery crew missing and the abysmal sales of Tickle Me Bender.
",139,87,5,15,Fry,Bender Doll18080,Bender Doll,"  Quit touching my junk, pervert!
",34,87,5,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18081,Farnsworth," Hold out your hands and I'll remove your career chips.
",56,87,5,15,Bender Doll,Zoidberg18082,Zoidberg," I hate to see it come to an end.  When will it end?
",53,87,5,15,Farnsworth,Hermes18083,Hermes," Shouldn't you get that, Professor?
",36,87,5,15,Zoidberg,Farnsworth18084,Farnsworth," I suppose.  Hello?
",20,87,5,15,Hermes,Leo18085,Leo," Professor, old buddy, I'm gonna blow up the violet dwarf star. So I need you deliver billion-mile security fence to keep out protesters. Dirty business. Lot of money. You corrupt enough?
",188,87,5,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18086,Farnsworth," Damn skippy!  Good news, crybabies! We're back in business.
",61,87,5,15,Leo,Hermes18087,Hermes," Sweet kookaburra of Edinburgh, Professor. You sure you know how to fly this thing?
",84,87,5,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18088,Farnsworth," I invented it, didn't I? You wouldn't ask Thomas Edison whether he knew how to use a sexmatron.
",97,87,5,15,Hermes,Leela18089,Leela," Halt! What are you doing in this parallelogram of space?
",58,87,5,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18090,Farnsworth," We're delivering a fence to keep you ladies in your place. 
",61,87,5,15,Leela,Zoidberg18091,Zoidberg," Amy?
",6,87,5,15,Farnsworth,Hermes18092,Hermes," Labarbara?
",12,87,5,15,Zoidberg,Labarbara18093,Labarbara," That's right, husband. From now on, you make your own Manwiches.
",66,87,5,15,Hermes,Mrs. Wong18094,Mrs. Wong," That was the greatest play I ever saw. It must have had 20 acts.
",66,87,5,15,Labarbara,Leela18095,Leela," We installed your fence, Leo Wong.
",36,87,5,15,Mrs. Wong,Linda18096,Linda," Should we shout a clever slogan?
",34,87,5,15,Leela,Leela18097,Leela," You mean something like, ""The best defense is a good fence?""
",62,87,5,15,Linda,Linda18098,Linda," Yeah, something like that, only funny.
",40,87,5,15,Leela,Leela18099,Leela," I wish we could, but our chief slogan writer is back at the Honeybun Hideout.
",79,87,5,15,Linda,Frida18100,Frida," Does ""violet dwarf"" rhyme with ""men are dorks""? It does through a megaphone. : That reminds me, I've got to tell Leela about that weirdo who wants to save the violet dwarf.
",174,87,5,15,Leela,Mysterious Voice18101,Mysterious Voice," So, the Legion of Madfellows has a new pawn, eh?
",50,87,5,15,Frida,Frida18102,Frida," Is somebody here? If you're the DSL guy, you're two days late.
",64,87,5,15,Mysterious Voice,Mysterious Voice18103,Mysterious Voice," Who gave you that message for Leela?
",38,87,5,15,Frida,Frida18104,Frida," I don't know his name.
",24,87,5,15,Mysterious Voice,Mysterious Voice18105,Mysterious Voice," Then you are of no use to the Dark Ones!
",42,87,5,15,Frida,Frida18106,Frida," Long lost brother, avenge my death.
",37,87,5,15,Mysterious Voice,Fry18107,Fry," Six, seven, eight. Lock the gate. One, two, three. Turn the key. 30, 50, 10.  My dirty, shifty friend?
",104,87,5,15,Frida,Hutch Waterfall18108,Hutch Waterfall," Hey, Fry, long time.
",22,87,5,15,Fry,Hutch Waterfall18109,Hutch Waterfall," Welcome back to the Legion of Madfellows, man.
",48,87,5,15,Hutch Waterfall,Fry18110,Fry," Why'd you bonk me, you idiot? You could have just asked me to come with you. And where are we? This doesn't look like your regular dumpster.
",142,87,5,15,Hutch Waterfall,Nine18111,Nine," All in good time! I guess now is a good time. We're on Mars, in a forgotten cavern abandoned by the native Martians a million years ago.
",138,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18112,Fry," Actually, it was five years ago. I remember 'cause they washed my socks.
",74,87,5,15,Nine,Nine18113,Nine," You have done well, Fry. You have ingratiated yourself with Leo Wong.
",71,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18114,Fry," Yup, I kissed his ass from cheek to shining cheek. So, what do I do next?
",75,87,5,15,Nine,Nine18115,Nine," As Wong security chief, you will be on hand when he attempts to destroy the violet dwarf. You must not let that happen.
",121,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18116,Fry,"  ""Must let happen.""
",21,87,5,15,Nine,Nine18117,Nine," Not happen!
",13,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18118,Fry," ""Must let occur.""
",19,87,5,15,Nine,Nine18119,Nine," Let me tell you a story. A story of two alien species so ancient that compared to them the human race is a mere college senior! On a distant planetoid they evolved to cooperate in their quest to survive.
",205,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18120,Fry," Cooperation, because life is a team sport.
",44,87,5,15,Nine,Nine18121,Nine," But, over time, one species evolved a better strategy, and an evolutionary arms race began.
",93,87,5,15,Fry,Nine18122,Nine," That concludes the audio-visual portion of our head-clonk and lecture.
",72,87,5,15,Nine,Fry18123,Fry," Wait, what happened to the snakes and the frogs? I need to know!
",66,87,5,15,Nine,Nine18124,Nine,"  The frogs, or possibly the snakes, evolved into vicious killing machines, honed by the merciless forces of natural selection and intelligent design. We call these the Dark Ones!
",180,87,5,15,Fry,Nine18125,Nine," Meanwhile, however, the second species evolved to fend off the Dark Ones, befriending and protecting all other living things.
",127,87,5,15,Nine,Fry18126,Fry," Even Celine Dion?
",19,87,5,15,Nine,Nine18127,Nine," Probably. We call these noble beings the Encyclopods, because their DNA incorporates the DNA of every endangered species they encountered, so they can recreate them if they go extinct.
",186,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18128,Fry," Just as a pillow, a wig and a corncob pipe can be used to recreate my old girlfriend!
",87,87,5,15,Nine,Nine18129,Nine," Bingo.
",8,87,5,15,Fry,Transition Announcer #118130,Transition Announcer #1," Meanwhile, at the Honeybun Hideout.
",37,87,5,15,Nine,Labarbara18131,Labarbara," Now you know how it feels to be locked up in a go-go cage.
",60,87,5,15,Transition Announcer #1,Hermes18132,Hermes," What the hell are you talking about?
",38,87,5,15,Labarbara,Labarbara18133,Labarbara," Shut your man-hole.
",21,87,5,15,Hermes,Hermes18134,Hermes," I feel dirty.
",15,87,5,15,Labarbara,Leela18135,Leela," Are you sure Fry is working for your father? It just doesn't seem like him to be so evil, or to hold down a job.
",114,87,5,15,Hermes,Amy18136,Amy," It's true, Leela. Cross My Heart bra and swear to Goddess.
",60,87,5,15,Leela,Leela18137,Leela," But the Fry I know wouldn't do that. I'm gonna call his cell phone telephone and prove you wrong.   Oh, no! Frida's been murdered!
",132,87,5,15,Amy,Labarbara18138,Labarbara," Sweet she-cattle of Seattle.
",30,87,5,15,Leela,Hermes18139,Hermes," Not your strong suit, woman.
",30,87,5,15,Labarbara,Amy18140,Amy," Who could have done this?
",27,87,5,15,Hermes,Leela18141,Leela," Your dad? Nixon?
",18,87,5,15,Amy,Amy18142,Amy," Fry?
",6,87,5,15,Leela,Leela18143,Leela," No, never. I don't think. Anyhow, there's a crazed murderer on the loose, possibly in the shadows or hanging from the ceiling.  So just stay calm while I call Fry.
",165,87,5,15,Amy,Fry18144,Fry," So where are the Encyclopods and the Dark Ones now?
",53,87,5,15,Leela,Nine18145,Nine," Wh-...  When the life-giving Chee receded, only the toughest organisms could adapt and survive, like the Dark Ones.  Many more died out, like the Encyclopods. But, and this is the great secret of our age, we believe they left an egg behind.
",242,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18146,Fry," Is it edible?
",15,87,5,15,Nine,Nine18147,Nine," We're not gonna eat it! Not unless we find a second one. No, Fry, we intend to hatch it!
",90,87,5,15,Fry,Hutch Waterfall18148,Hutch Waterfall," And that's where you come in.
",31,87,5,15,Nine,Fry18149,Fry," And here I am.
",16,87,5,15,Hutch Waterfall,Nine18150,Nine," At long last the tide of Chee has returned, and its nourishing flow has awakened the dormant egg.
",99,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18151,Fry," That's good.
",14,87,5,15,Nine,Hutch Waterfall18152,Hutch Waterfall," It's better than good. It's better. With its massive stash of DNA, the Encyclopod can reconstruct every species that ever went extinct.
",137,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18153,Fry," So, where is this egg?
",24,87,5,15,Hutch Waterfall,Nine18154,Nine," In the violet dwarf star system.
",34,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18155,Fry," And what does it look like?
",29,87,5,15,Nine,Nine18156,Nine," A violet dwarf star!
",22,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18157,Fry," You mean, the whole star is a single... Whoa! Sci-fi.
",55,87,5,15,Nine,Nine18158,Nine," Alas! Even now, a Dark One is headed to the star to ensure its destruction.
",77,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18159,Fry," Dang! So what does this Dark One look like?
",45,87,5,15,Nine,Nine18160,Nine,"  We don't know. I admit it's a horrifically grave situation.
",62,87,5,15,Fry,Hutch Waterfall18161,Hutch Waterfall," Don't sugarcoat it, Nine. The Dark Ones have been evolving so long, it could be anything or anyone. Or anybody.
",113,87,5,15,Nine,Fry18162,Fry," You mean, like, people?
",25,87,5,15,Hutch Waterfall,Hutch Waterfall18163,Hutch Waterfall," Any people. It will kill the egg, and every dude, woman and child who knows about it.
",87,87,5,15,Fry,Nine18164,Nine," Even our crazy caps will be useless at close range. That's why only you, with your defective unreadable brainwave, may be able to thwart them and usher in a new green age of wonder and...
",189,87,5,15,Hutch Waterfall,Fry18165,Fry," You're on Fry-time. Leela! Did you get my message?
",52,87,5,15,Nine,Leela18166,Leela," What message?
",15,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18167,Fry," Didn't you see Frida Waterfall?
",33,87,5,15,Leela,Leela18168,Leela," So you did kill Frida Waterfall?
",34,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18169,Fry," What? No. I told her to tell you that I'm... Oh, Jeep! The Dark Ones got her. It's all true. We need to talk, Leela. Then I can explain...  Well, I can't explain anything, but we should talk anyway. Where are you?
",215,87,5,15,Leela,Leela18170,Leela," Oh, no. I'm not gonna expose the Honeybun Hideout. Where are you?
",67,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18171,Fry," Near the Keeler Crater on Mars. Do you know it?
",49,87,5,15,Leela,Leela18172,Leela," I, I, uh... I think I read about it.
",38,87,5,15,Fry,Leela18173,Leela,"  I'll meet you at the south rim in one hour. No moustaches.
",61,87,5,15,Leela,Zapp18174,Zapp," Kif, set coordinates, 36-24-36. AKA, Leela.
",45,87,5,15,Leela,Fry18175,Fry," Ten minutes late. Ain't that just like a womanista?
",53,87,5,15,Zapp,Leela18176,Leela," Psst. Are you alone?
",22,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18177,Fry," Of course, don't you trust me?
",32,87,5,15,Leela,Zapp18178,Zapp," There's no escape, Leela. If you surrender, wave your shirt in the air.
",73,87,5,15,Fry,Leela18179,Leela," Fry, you traitor!
",19,87,5,15,Zapp,Amy18180,Amy," Hop onto the magnet, Leela!
",29,87,5,15,Leela,Leela18181,Leela," Okay. One, two... 
",20,87,5,15,Amy,Leela18182,Leela,"  I can't believe you ratted me out, Fry.
",42,87,5,15,Leela,Fry18183,Fry," I'm not a rat, I swear. If I'm any rodent, it's the loyal capybara, king of the rats! No, wait.
",97,87,5,15,Leela,Amy18184,Amy," Stay strong, ladies. We can lose them in the giant miniature golf course.
",75,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18185,Fry," But the course isn't finished. And there's no girls allowed.
",62,87,5,15,Amy,Amy18186,Amy," Fore! 
",8,87,5,15,Fry,Zapp18187,Zapp," So, they want to play mini golf, eh? Two can play at that game. Or even four, depending on the number of ball colors available.
",129,87,5,15,Amy,Zapp18188,Zapp," I choose pink.
",16,87,5,15,Zapp,Kif18189,Kif," That's their color, sir.
",26,87,5,15,Zapp,Zapp18190,Zapp," The hell it is.
",17,87,5,15,Kif,Leela18191,Leela," They're gaining on us. We need a birdie on the windmill hole.
",63,87,5,15,Zapp,Amy18192,Amy," Wait. Wait. Drop the boot!
",28,87,5,15,Leela,Kif18193,Kif," Sir, at our present speed, the computer predicts a 100% chance we'll be sliced in half. We'll never make it.
",110,87,5,15,Amy,Zapp18194,Zapp," Not with that attitude, we won't. Same speed ahead!
",53,87,5,15,Kif,Zapp18195,Zapp," We made it through, Kif. How many men did we lose?
",52,87,5,15,Zapp,Kif18196,Kif," All of them.
",14,87,5,15,Zapp,Zapp18197,Zapp," Well, at least they won't have to mourn each other. Seal the airlocks, and draw the shades. Resume shooting.
",110,87,5,15,Kif,Fry18198,Fry," Oh, no! The gorilla! That's a par-four!
",41,87,5,15,Zapp,Leela18199,Leela," The mouth's too dangerous. I'm going for the nose.
",52,87,5,15,Fry,Amy18200,Amy," Don't be a sucker. You won't come out anywhere near the hole. You need to aim for the jaws just when they start to close.
",123,87,5,15,Leela,Leela18201,Leela," Start to close? Are you out of your...
",40,87,5,15,Amy,Leela18202,Leela," We made it!
",13,87,5,15,Leela,Zapp18203,Zapp," Captaining 101 . Go for the nose.
",35,87,5,15,Leela,Bender18204,Bender," My arms are broken, I'll never paint again. 
",46,87,5,15,Zapp,Kif18205,Kif," You can't sue the military.
",29,87,5,15,Bender,Bender18206,Bender," I'm okay then.
",16,87,5,15,Kif,Zapp18207,Zapp," Damage report.
",16,87,5,15,Bender,Kif18208,Kif," We lost all remaining food and oxygen, Captain. As well as our XM Radio antenna.
",82,87,5,15,Zapp,Zapp18209,Zapp," Then this chase is over. Kif, set course for the nearest XM repair facility. Meanwhile, we shall sing top hits from the '80s.
",127,87,5,15,Kif,Kif18210,Kif," Which '80s, sir?
",18,87,5,15,Zapp,Zapp18211,Zapp," For me, there are only one '80s.  : Smell like I sound,  I'm lost and I'm found. And I'm hungry like the wolf.
",112,87,5,15,Kif,Hermes18212,Hermes," The shot was too good! We're jamming straight for the hole.
",61,87,5,15,Zapp,Zoidberg18213,Zoidberg," We're gonna crash, even.
",26,87,5,15,Hermes,Amy18214,Amy," Shmeesh, shmill out, shmeverybody. It's a wormhole hole.
",58,87,5,15,Zoidberg,Farnsworth18215,Farnsworth," Of course, a wormhole! We'll simply disappear and reappear in a...  ...nother part of the universe.
",101,87,5,15,Amy,Amy18216,Amy," We made it!
",13,87,5,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18217,Farnsworth," Uh, whaa...
",13,87,5,15,Amy,Leela18218,Leela," Crud nuggets! We de-spaced right next to the Nimbus.
",54,87,5,15,Farnsworth,Zoidberg18219,Zoidberg," Just when you think the chase is over, it gets twice as exciting!
",67,87,5,15,Leela,Bender18220,Bender," Hey, look at that.
",20,87,5,15,Zoidberg,Zapp18221,Zapp," Well, well, well. My bloodhound-like instincts must have hunted them down while my other parts were throbbing to Duran Duran.
",127,87,5,15,Bender,Kif18222,Kif," Shall I initiate a pointless and potentially fatal pursuit?
",61,87,5,15,Zapp,Zapp18223,Zapp," Make it so.
",13,87,5,15,Kif,Bender18224,Bender," It's gonna be fun on a bun, in space.
",39,87,5,15,Zapp,Leela18225,Leela," Look! The asteroid. Now it's crawling with life. Like Zoidberg's sandals!
",75,87,5,15,Bender,Fry18226,Fry," Wow! It's incredible.
",23,87,5,15,Leela,Leela18227,Leela," But it'll be destroyed when Leo Wong blows up the violet dwarf. So why are you helping him?
",93,87,5,15,Fry,Fry18228,Fry," I can't tell you, Leela. You just have to trust me.
",53,87,5,15,Leela,Leela18229,Leela," You keep saying that, but you have to give me something to go on or I...

",37,87,5,15,Leela,Leela18231,Leela,"  The out-of-fuel indicator. It's indicating.
",46,87,5,15,Planet Express Ship Alarm,Zoidberg18232,Zoidberg," Say, what's that violet-colored dwarf-like star thing we're drifting into?
",76,87,5,15,Leela,Leela18233,Leela," The violet dwarf star!
",24,87,5,15,Zoidberg,Fry18234,Fry," Of course. The gorilla was the 18th hole, so we're headed into the ball return.
",81,87,5,15,Leela,Zoidberg18235,Zoidberg," Aye, what else now can go wrong?
",34,87,5,15,Fry,Zapp18236,Zapp,"  Ladies, you're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded again and again.

",29,87,5,15,Zapp,Leela18238,Leela," Don't give up yet. I've got one more trick up my sleeve.
",58,87,5,15,Petunia,Amy18239,Amy," That's exactly the number we need.
",36,87,5,15,Leela,Zapp18240,Zapp," Ah, the fairer sex.
",21,87,5,15,Amy,Zapp18241,Zapp," Something's very wrong here, and yet a little bit right.
",58,87,5,15,Zapp,Leela18242,Leela," Not so fast, Brannigan.

",100,88,5,16,Fry,Nine18251,Nine," You must gain Wong's confidence, infiltrate his organization and prevent him from destroying the violet dwarf.

",30,88,5,16,Leela,Bailiff18260,Bailiff," Oye, oye, oye. All rise for the honorable Chief Justice D-O-G-G and the Associate Justices.
",93,88,5,16,Bender,Snoop Doggs18261,Snoop Doggs," Yo. Seat it or beat it. The charges against y'all femditos is murder, mayhem, vandalism, kidnapping and resisting arrest. Damn! The big five. You may now make your opening ""what you got to say for yourselves.""

",10,88,5,16,Leela,Leela18264,Leela," These charges are outrageous. Our only goal was to save a rare violet star and its precious ecosystem. If protecting the environment is a crime, then...

",40,88,5,16,Leela,Leela18266,Leela,"  I rest my mouth.
",19,88,5,16,Judge #1 Dogg,Bailiff18267,Bailiff," Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

",59,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18275,Fry," Well, abducted is such an ugly word.
",38,88,5,16,Dogg,Clarence Thomas head18276,Clarence Thomas head," Mr. Wong, the court cannot compel you to testify against your own daughter.
",77,88,5,16,Fry,Leo18277,Leo," No. No, I want to. Also, I got something to say about my wife.
",64,88,5,16,Clarence Thomas head,Dogg18278,Dogg," Aw, yeah. Having heard some of the testimony over these jams I've been listening to, me and my crew will now kick it in the mix.
",130,88,5,16,Leo,Dogg18279,Dogg," A'ight. We got us a verdict up in this High Court. Bailiff, drop it like it's legal precedent.
",96,88,5,16,Dogg,Bailiff18280,Bailiff," In the matter of Leo Wong v. The Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, four justices vote to convict, five to acquit.
",117,88,5,16,Dogg,Scalia18281,Scalia," However, since the vote was strictly along gender lines and the female justices' votes only count half, you are hereby found guilty.

",35,88,5,16,Warden,Warden18286,Warden," This is a privately-owned for-profit prison and I run a tight, cheap ship! I've done this by cutting cost everywhere, especially on punishment. I rely on you inmates to make prison unpleasant for yourselves. You're encouraged to sexually harass new prisoners, organize no-holds-barred catfights and maintain poor hygiene.
",323,88,5,16,Petunia,Amy18287,Amy," Try and make me, copper.
",26,88,5,16,Warden,Warden18288,Warden," Oh... a troublemaker.  Taste the lash of my 99-cent-store nightstick!
",71,88,5,16,Amy,Leo18289,Leo," Yee-ha! With the feministas in jail, it full speed ahead. You and me, Fry. We implode the violet dwarf star tomorrow. Ka-boom-boom.
",133,88,5,16,Warden,Fry18290,Fry," You and me?
",13,88,5,16,Leo,Leo18291,Leo," Yeah.
",7,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18292,Fry," Tomorrow?

",11,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18294,Fry," Ka-boom?
",10,88,5,16,Leo,Leo18295,Leo," Ka-boom-boom.
",15,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18296,Fry," Hello? Madfellows? I need to-  Okay, Leo Wong's about to destroy the violet dwarf. So, whatever I need to know to stop him, tell me now.
",138,88,5,16,Leo,Nine18297,Nine," Alas! Stopping Wong isn't the only problem. One of the Dark Ones will try to stop you from stopping him. So, you must stop it from stopping you from stopping him.
",164,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18298,Fry," But how can I stop it stop me stop him?
",41,88,5,16,Nine,Nine18299,Nine," Stop it! Behold, the Omega Device.
",36,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18300,Fry," That's it?
",12,88,5,16,Nine,Nine18301,Nine," The important thing is what's inside.
",39,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18302,Fry," What does that look like?
",27,88,5,16,Nine,Hutch Waterfall18303,Hutch Waterfall," No one knows, man. It was invented by a blind inventor, and the one dude he described it to was deaf.
",103,88,5,16,Fry,Mad Fellow18304,Mad Fellow," So the legend goes.
",21,88,5,16,Hutch Waterfall,Nine18305,Nine," When activated, the device will emit a localized blast of delta-band noise to momentarily disable the Dark One.
",113,88,5,16,Mad Fellow,Fry18306,Fry," But the Dark One could look like anything or anyone, right?
",61,88,5,16,Nine,Hutch Waterfall18307,Hutch Waterfall," Or anywhere.
",14,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18308,Fry," So, what's your plan to recognize it?
",39,88,5,16,Hutch Waterfall,Nine18309,Nine," We don't have one.
",20,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18310,Fry," Got it.
",9,88,5,16,Nine,Hutch Waterfall18311,Hutch Waterfall," And we don't dare think of one neither. 'Cause if we do, the Dark Ones might sense kind of the general vibe. Even through our mighty foil.  Oh, man! Anyone got some tape or some gum?
",184,88,5,16,Fry,Nine18312,Nine," As my colleague indicated, the plan cannot come from us, Fry. We were counting on you and your unreadable brain to come up with something.
",140,88,5,16,Hutch Waterfall,Fry18313,Fry," That was a mistake.
",21,88,5,16,Nine,Nine18314,Nine," I see that now.
",17,88,5,16,Fry,Hutch Waterfall18315,Hutch Waterfall," Freaky thing is, the Dark Ones' thoughts are unreadable, just like yours.
",75,88,5,16,Nine,Nine18316,Nine," Yes, if we dared unwrap our heads, we could easily locate the one other being whose mind we can't read. The Dark One!
",119,88,5,16,Hutch Waterfall,Hutch Waterfall18317,Hutch Waterfall," But then the Dark One would read our minds and crush them like blood pumpkins.
",80,88,5,16,Nine,Fry18318,Fry," Wait. I can read minds and my mind can't be read. I have a plan.
",66,88,5,16,Hutch Waterfall,Nine18319,Nine," Great. Whatever it is, don't tell us.
",39,88,5,16,Fry,Hutch Waterfall18320,Hutch Waterfall," Wait. Fry can read minds and his mind can't be read. So he can safely scan for the Dark One...
",96,88,5,16,Nine,Nine18321,Nine," Shut up! Shut up!
",19,88,5,16,Hutch Waterfall,Hutch Waterfall18322,Hutch Waterfall," ...whose mind can't be read...
",32,88,5,16,Nine,Mysterious Voice18323,Mysterious Voice," Leela, time is running out. We must get to the violet star.
",61,88,5,16,Hutch Waterfall,Leela18324,Leela," Okay, okay. Shut up, already.
",31,88,5,16,Mysterious Voice,Dixie18325,Dixie," Nobody's talking, Leela.
",26,88,5,16,Leela,Trixie18326,Trixie," We're just painting each other's toenails with rat blood.
",59,88,5,16,Dixie,Linda18327,Linda," We now go live to Leela with the escape plan. Leela?
",54,88,5,16,Trixie,Leela18328,Leela," Thanks, Linda. Now we're in here because we tried to save endangered wildlife. So this time, endangered wildlife will save us.
",128,88,5,16,Linda,Amy18329,Amy," The Martian muck leech.
",25,88,5,16,Leela,Leela18330,Leela,"  Little cutie almost sucked me dry.
",37,88,5,16,Amy,Labarbara18331,Labarbara," Look at him go. Like a green snake through a sugarcane cake.
",62,88,5,16,Leela,Hermes18332,Hermes," Keep trying.
",14,88,5,16,Labarbara,Morbo18333,Morbo," Our top story. The universe's most wanted eco-feminists are now behind bars, including gang leader, Turanga Leela. AKA, the Notorious B-I-Itch.
",145,88,5,16,Hermes,Zoidberg18334,Zoidberg," We finished un-pinking the ship, Hubert. Now what?
",52,88,5,16,Morbo,Farnsworth18335,Farnsworth," Now we get back to work. And if that means destroying an ecosystem or two, so be it.
",86,88,5,16,Zoidberg,Zoidberg18336,Zoidberg," I just meant without our good friends Fry, Leela, Amy and the robut.
",70,88,5,16,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18337,Farnsworth," Oh, boo-hoo.
",14,88,5,16,Zoidberg,Scruffy18338,Scruffy," Life goes on. But I believe we'll forever carry the pain on the inside.
",73,88,5,16,Farnsworth,Amy18339,Amy," Oh, no, a rooster! That indicates it's the following morning.
",63,88,5,16,Scruffy,Labarbara18340,Labarbara," How's that creepy crawler doing?
",34,88,5,16,Amy,Leela18341,Leela," I'm sorry, femi-sisters, but it pooped out around 3:00 a.m. Poor thing couldn't take another bite.
",100,88,5,16,Labarbara,Amy18342,Amy," Well, I guess we failed. But what matters is, we tried our best and we looked good doing it.
",94,88,5,16,Leela,Amy18343,Amy," Bender?
",9,88,5,16,Amy,Bender18344,Bender," Who does it look like? My identical cousin Buster?
",52,88,5,16,Amy,Amy18345,Amy," Yes.
",6,88,5,16,Bender,Leela18346,Leela," You're here to break us out? But you're the one who put us in.
",64,88,5,16,Amy,Bender18347,Bender," But I'm Bender, king of the combination shot. I put you in so that by busting you out, I could commit 15 felonies at once. Puttin' my rap sheet miles ahead of yours on the all-time chart.
",189,88,5,16,Leela,Leela18348,Leela," You are one devious bastard.
",30,88,5,16,Bender,Bender18349,Bender," That's what it says on my vanity plate. 
",42,88,5,16,Leela,Leela18350,Leela," What about the sentries?
",26,88,5,16,Bender,Leela18351,Leela," Okay, Plan B. Everyone knows men have one fatal weakness - they can't resist hookers. Dixie, Trixie, you know what to do.
",123,88,5,16,Leela,Bender18352,Bender,"  Hello, boys!  Your eyes say no, but your machine gun fire says- 
",67,88,5,16,Leela,Leo18353,Leo," Ladies and gentleman and whatever, welcome to my most environmentally disastrous implosion ever. A whole star system!
",119,88,5,16,Bender,Zapp18354,Zapp," Kif, old boy, mind if I sit on your shoulders for a better view?
",66,88,5,16,Leo,Kif18355,Kif," Well, actually, sir, I was hoping...
",38,88,5,16,Zapp,Leo18356,Leo," My associate Philip Fry here will have honor to blow this ugly, dirty star into nice, clean black hole.
",105,88,5,16,Kif,Leo18357,Leo," Fry, what you doing down there?
",33,88,5,16,Leo,Fry18358,Fry,"  Just polishing your shoes, Mr. W.
",36,88,5,16,Leo,Leo18359,Leo," Mmm, that nice. Get between the toes there, very dirty.
",57,88,5,16,Fry,Bender18360,Bender," Well, so much for Plan B.
",27,88,5,16,Leo,Leela18361,Leela," What's Plan C?
",16,88,5,16,Bender,Bender18362,Bender," All situations have the same Plan C. Bending, come on.
",56,88,5,16,Leela,Leela18363,Leela," We're boned, Bender. It's a brick wall.
",41,88,5,16,Bender,Bender18364,Bender," Granted, it's not on the list of approved bendables, but I'm so great!
",72,88,5,16,Leela,Amy18365,Amy," Dogs! The boning continues.
",29,88,5,16,Bender,Bender18366,Bender,"  Green Bluebird, this is Mr. Fabulous. We are go for cheesing it.
",67,88,5,16,Amy,Leela18367,Leela,"  Professor! Hermes! Zoidberg!  Uh...
",38,88,5,16,Bender,Scruffy18368,Scruffy," Scruffy. The janitor.
",23,88,5,16,Leela,Leela18369,Leela," You helped us escape? Even after we locked you in a go-go cage like common go-go dancers?
",91,88,5,16,Scruffy,Farnsworth18370,Farnsworth," I couldn't live with myself, Leela. I call myself a scientist, wear the white coat and probe a monkey every now and again, yet I put monetary gain ahead of preserving nature. Can you ever forgive me?
",201,88,5,16,Leela,Scruffy18371,Scruffy," I reckon.
",11,88,5,16,Farnsworth,Leela18372,Leela," I could kiss you, Professor.
",30,88,5,16,Scruffy,Farnsworth18373,Farnsworth," Okay, but watch out for my new grill. 
",40,88,5,16,Leela,Zapp18374,Zapp," Before the grand finally  , as it were, it seems only fitting that I, Commodore 64 Zapp Brannigan, say a few brief pages in honor of...
",137,88,5,16,Farnsworth,Nine18375,Nine," Whatever your plan is, Fry, I suggest you get on with it. Get... Shoot, I got hot sauce on my Number 9 shirt.
",111,88,5,16,Zapp,Fry18376,Fry," Okay, locate the Dark One by finding someone whose thoughts I can't read.
",75,88,5,16,Nine,Zapp18377,Zapp," And unaccustomed...
",21,88,5,16,Fry,Zapp18378,Zapp," By God! I'm the greatest speaker of all time. They're suckling at the teats of my every syllable.
",99,88,5,16,Zapp,Zapp18379,Zapp," Allow me now...
",17,88,5,16,Zapp,Kif18380,Kif," His voice is like ear sandpaper.I miss Amy.
",45,88,5,16,Zapp,Mom18381,Mom,"  If I had all the money in the world, I'd... Oh, wait. I do. 
",63,88,5,16,Kif,Calculon18382,Calculon," I'd like to thank the academy, my agent, and most of all, my operating system, Windows 7, for everything it... System error.
",126,88,5,16,Mom,Snoop Dogg18383,Snoop Dogg," Naked ladies. Naked ladies. Naked ladies. Naked ladies.
",57,88,5,16,Calculon,Leo18384,Leo," I never should have taken that accent elimination class from Jackie Chan.
",75,88,5,16,Snoop Dogg,Zapp18385,Zapp," And so, as we obliterize this star, let us remember those immortal words once spoken by a great man, moi. And I quote, ""All good things must come to an end, preferably in a humongous explosion.""
",196,88,5,16,Leo,Leo18386,Leo," Let's pop this beach ball.
",28,88,5,16,Zapp,All18387,All," Ten! Nine! Eight!
",19,88,5,16,Leo,Fry18388,Fry," There's no one here whose thoughts can't be read. No one, except me! My thoughts can't be read. But, but that's crazy. If I were the Dark One, I'd know it, wouldn't I? But, here I am, right where the Dark One would be, about to blow up the star. Oh, God! Somewhere deep inside of me, it's me! I'm the Dark One!
",312,88,5,16,All,All18389,All," Two... one!
",13,88,5,16,Fry,Leela18390,Leela," Put your hands in the air!
",28,88,5,16,All,Snoop Dogg18391,Snoop Dogg," Should we wave them like we just don't care?
",46,88,5,16,Leela,Leela18392,Leela," That's optional.
",18,88,5,16,Snoop Dogg,Leo18393,Leo," You girl punks gone too far this time. Your parents should be ashamed.
",72,88,5,16,Leela,Amy18394,Amy," Yes, you should!
",18,88,5,16,Leo,Kif18395,Kif," Amy!
",6,88,5,16,Amy,Mysterious Voice18396,Mysterious Voice," Destroy the star, Leo, hurry.
",31,88,5,16,Kif,Leo18397,Leo," You got it, Mr. Voice-in-my-head.  I've gotta admit, Amy, you got a pretty good swing.
",88,88,5,16,Mysterious Voice,Amy18398,Amy," Really? Thanks, Dad.
",22,88,5,16,Leo,Leela18399,Leela," Okay, time to defuse this star cracker once and for all. 
",59,88,5,16,Amy,Fry18400,Fry," Leela, wait. You're making a mistake. You have no idea what's really going on.
",80,88,5,16,Leela,Leela18401,Leela," What is really going on?
",26,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18402,Fry," I can't tell you.
",19,88,5,16,Leela,Leela18403,Leela," Then why should I trust you? Why?
",35,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18404,Fry," Because... Because...
",23,88,5,16,Leela,Leela18405,Leela," You're you. That's all I need to know.
",40,88,5,16,Fry,Bender18406,Bender," No! Don't do it!
",18,88,5,16,Leela,Scruffy18407,Scruffy," Fiddlesticks.
",15,88,5,16,Bender,Amy18408,Amy," Leela, are you crazy? We became fugitives and jail-breakers to stop him.
",74,88,5,16,Scruffy,Bender18409,Bender," And hookers, don't forget hookers.
",36,88,5,16,Amy,Leela18410,Leela," Shame on all of you. After everything we've been through together, do you really think Fry would-
",99,88,5,16,Bender,Fry18411,Fry," Goodbye, Leela. I destroy myself to save you.
",47,88,5,16,Leela,Nixons Head18412,Nixons Head," Where's the boom? I was expecting a boom.
",43,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18413,Fry," It didn't work. I'm the Dark One, and it didn't do anything. 
",63,88,5,16,Nixons Head,Mysterious Voice18414,Mysterious Voice,"  You're not the Dark One, I am.
",33,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18415,Fry," Leela?
",8,88,5,16,Mysterious Voice,Mysterious Voice18416,Mysterious Voice," Not Leela, you moron. Me!  What did you do to me?
",51,88,5,16,Fry,Leela18417,Leela," Ew!
",5,88,5,16,Mysterious Voice,Dark One18418,Dark One," I am the Dark One. The very last Dark One. How is it possible I couldn't read your mind? Oh, I am momentarily disabled.
",121,88,5,16,Leela,Randy18419,Randy,"  What's happening out there?
",30,88,5,16,Dark One,Sal18420,Sal," Somethings wondersful.
",24,88,5,16,Randy,Leela18421,Leela," The star and the asteroid. They were an egg and a sperm.
",58,88,5,16,Sal,Preacherbot18422,Preacherbot," Great modem of mercy. Cover the children's eyes.
",50,88,5,16,Leela,Morbo18423,Morbo," There are no children here.
",29,88,5,16,Preacherbot,Preacherbot18424,Preacherbot," Then move your fat head. I can't see.
",39,88,5,16,Morbo,Nine18425,Nine," The Encyclopod is reborn. A new green age has begun!
",54,88,5,16,Preacherbot,Mad Fellow18426,Mad Fellow," So the legend foretold.
",25,88,5,16,Nine,Farnsworth18427,Farnsworth," Look! Inside its pouch. Extinct Tasmanian tigers.
",51,88,5,16,Mad Fellow,Amy18428,Amy," And dodo birds.
",17,88,5,16,Farnsworth,Leela18429,Leela," And white rhinos.
",19,88,5,16,Amy,Hermes18430,Hermes," And striped biologist-taunters.
",33,88,5,16,Leela,Striped biologist-taunter18431,Striped biologist-taunter," What are you gonna do, shoot us?
",34,88,5,16,Hermes,Encyclopod18432,Encyclopod," Life!  These once extinct plants and animals are my gift to the universe. Through untold generations, my race has treasured their DNA. Treat them wisely with the knowledge that all species are precious.
",204,88,5,16,Striped biologist-taunter,Leela18433,Leela," This is unbelievable. What's going on?
",40,88,5,16,Encyclopod,Hutch Waterfall18434,Hutch Waterfall," To answer that, I must tell you a story. A story of two alien species so ancient that-
",88,88,5,16,Leela,Fry18435,Fry," Hutch, are you okay?
",22,88,5,16,Hutch Waterfall,Hutch Waterfall18436,Hutch Waterfall," My sister's femi-necklace. 
",29,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18437,Fry," What?   Hey, how come I can't read your thoughts anymore?
",59,88,5,16,Hutch Waterfall,Encyclopod18438,Encyclopod," I shall avenge you, Hutch Waterfall.
",38,88,5,16,Fry,Nine18439,Nine," After all these eons, the Dark Ones are no more. Will you preserve their DNA, O' Great Encyclopod?
",100,88,5,16,Encyclopod,Encyclopod18440,Encyclopod," I suppose I should. Wait, where did it go?
",44,88,5,16,Nine,Zoidberg18441,Zoidberg," What?
",7,88,5,16,Encyclopod,Encyclopod18442,Encyclopod," Well, at any rate, I shall preserve the DNA of Homo sapiens.
",62,88,5,16,Zoidberg,Fry18443,Fry," Huh. I thought you only saved the DNA of endangered species.
",62,88,5,16,Encyclopod,Encyclopod18444,Encyclopod," Farewell. 
",12,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18445,Fry," I guess he didn't hear me.
",28,88,5,16,Encyclopod,Bender18446,Bender," Well, looks like that wraps everything up in a nice big, old, fat sack of...
",78,88,5,16,Fry,Zapp18447,Zapp," I hereby arrest you fugitives on 53 counts of fugivity. Kif, round them up, and spare me the weary sigh for once.  Kif?
",121,88,5,16,Bender,Kif18448,Kif,"  Wait for me.
",15,88,5,16,Zapp,Fry18449,Fry," Well, this is the end. There was so many things I wanted to say to you.
",73,88,5,16,Kif,Leela18450,Leela," Like what?
",12,88,5,16,Fry,Fry18451,Fry," Like this is not the end. But mostly just, I love you, Leela.
",63,88,5,16,Leela,Leela18452,Leela," Maybe I waited too long to say this, but I love you, too- wormhole!
",69,88,5,16,Fry,Hermes18453,Hermes," Sweet topology of cosmology, it's huge!
",41,88,5,16,Leela,Farnsworth18454,Farnsworth," If we fly into it, it could take us trillions of light years away. There's no knowing if we'll ever return.
",109,88,5,16,Hermes,Fry18455,Fry," What do we do? Should we go for it?
",37,88,5,16,Farnsworth,Bender18456,Bender," Into the breach, meatbags. Or not. Whatever. 
",47,88,5,16,Fry,All18457,All," Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
",41,88,5,16,Bender,Bender18458,Bender,"  On the count of three, you will awaken feeling refreshed, as if Futurama had never been cancelled by idiots, then brought back by bigger idiots. 1... 2... .
",159,89,6,1,All,Bender18459,Bender,"  This has been a test of the Emergency Hypnotoad System.  Had this been an actual hypnosis, you would go limp and watch whatever crap comes on next.  Comin' up next: Futurama! 
",178,89,6,1,Bender,Fry18460,Fry," Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy.
",37,89,6,1,Bender,Farnsworth18461,Farnsworth," OK.
",5,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18462,Fry," That's all. 
Â  Oh, also; I'm covered with severe burns.
",57,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18463,Farnsworth," So!?  What of it?
",19,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18464,Fry," Well, why isâ€“ those things?
",29,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18465,Farnsworth," You mean you don't remember?
",30,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18466,Fry," Nope, nothing. It's like when I passed out in college, except no one drew magic marker penises on my forehead.
",112,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18467,Farnsworth," Well, I suppose it's for the best, considering the unbearable horrors you've endured. Let's never speak of it again.
Â  It all began a few days ago. We were interstellar fugitives on the run from the law.
",205,89,6,1,Fry,Zapp18468,Zapp," Fire all weapons and open a hailing frequency for my victory yodel.
",69,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18469,Farnsworth,"  And so, as you and Leela kissed goodbye in a tender display of toungesmanship, we plunged into a massive wormhole. Never to be seen again.
",141,89,6,1,Zapp,Bender18470,Bender," Yeah, we're back.
",19,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Hermes18471,Hermes," Sweet coincidence of Port-au-Prince, we're back at Earth!
",59,89,6,1,Bender,Farnsworth18472,Farnsworth," Of course, that was the Panama Wormhole, Earth's central channel for shipping!
",80,89,6,1,Hermes,Zoidberg18473,Zoidberg," How humorous.
",15,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18474,Farnsworth," Yes! It's sort of a Comedy Central channel, and we're on it now!
",66,89,6,1,Zoidberg,Amy18475,Amy," I get it!
",11,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Fry18476,Fry," We've lost power to the forward Game Boy, Mario not responding!
",65,89,6,1,Amy,Leela18477,Leela," Brace for emergency landing!
",30,89,6,1,Fry,Farnsworth18478,Farnsworth," Rodger that, activate Safety Spheres!  Also mine has air conditioning.
",72,89,6,1,Leela,Farnsworth18479,Farnsworth," Yet, thanks to my trusty safety sphere, I surblibed with only tribial bray dablage.
",85,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Fry18480,Fry," And the others?
",17,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18481,Farnsworth," Right here behind this horror cloth.
",38,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18482,Fry," Are they dead?
",16,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18483,Farnsworth," Oh, no no no, much worse.
",27,89,6,1,Fry,Farnsworth18484,Farnsworth," Move over God! Prepare for rebirth!  Wrong switch. 
",53,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18485,Farnsworth," Come on, stem cells. Work your astounding scientific nonsense!
",64,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Fry18486,Fry," Fetal steam cells? Aren't those controversial?
",48,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18487,Farnsworth," In your time yes, but nowadays, shut up! Besides, these are adult stem cells harvested from perfectly healthy adults, whom I killed for their stem cells.
",155,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18488,Fry," Hermes Conrad!
",16,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Hermes18489,Hermes,"  Oh, mon! I'm dripping with placenta! Good thing it's Casual Friday.
",70,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18490,Fry," Amy Wong!
",11,89,6,1,Hermes,Amy18491,Amy," Oh, baby soft!
",16,89,6,1,Fry,Farnsworth18492,Farnsworth,"  Indeed.
Hermes: Dr. Zoidberg!
",32,89,6,1,Amy,Zoidberg18493,Zoidberg," Hermes, my friend! Let me cut off your umbilical cord.  Oops.
",63,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Fry18494,Fry," And the rest!
",15,89,6,1,Zoidberg,Amy18495,Amy," Hooray, we're back in business!
",33,89,6,1,Fry,Zapp18496,Zapp," Over my dead body.  Uh, never mind.
",37,89,6,1,Amy,Fry18497,Fry,"  Bender! Are the steam cells working? 
",40,89,6,1,Zapp,Bender18498,Bender,"  I'm dying. I need mouth to ass resuscitation.
",48,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18499,Fry," I'm on it!  It's not working!
",31,89,6,1,Bender,Bender18500,Bender,"  I die happy knowing you fell for that.
",41,89,6,1,Fry,Farnsworth18501,Farnsworth," His power supply is shot! He is flatlining!  Only one thing can keep him alive.  Possibly this thing. 
",104,89,6,1,Bender,Bender18502,Bender," Woo! I've never felt so energetic! 
",37,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18503,Farnsworth," That's because the doomsday device I shoved all up in you puts out 50 gigawatts. That's ten times your recommended--
",118,89,6,1,Bender,Bender18504,Bender," Who are you? My warranty? 
",28,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18505,Farnsworth," For God's sake, Bender! Keep dancing, keep whooping it up!  You must burn off the doomsday energy as fast as it produces, or it will build to critical levels.
",160,89,6,1,Bender,Bender18506,Bender," You don't mean...
",19,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18507,Farnsworth," Oh, but I do. If you stop partying for a single second, you'll explode and kill everyone here in a fireball of melting gears and splattered bowels.
",149,89,6,1,Bender,Bender18508,Bender," Sounds like a party, baby! 
",29,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Fry18509,Fry," Hey! Speaking of splattered bowels, can I cook you a romantic dinner tonight, Leela?... Where's Leela?  Is she okay? Why hasn't she acknowledged my dinner offer?
",163,89,6,1,Bender,Farnsworth18510,Farnsworth," Something's wrong! She's not responding to my poking stick. 
",62,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18511,Fry," Poke harder, damn it!
",23,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18512,Farnsworth," I'm poking as hard as I can! I'm sorry, Fry,  but I'm afraid Leela is in an irreversible coma.
",96,89,6,1,Fry,Bender18513,Bender,"  Coma, coma, coma, coma, coma, chameleon!
",43,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Fry18514,Fry," My soul mate is gone. Why should I go on living?
",50,89,6,1,Bender,Bender18515,Bender," Because the pain slowly fades but the love is forever. 
",57,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18516,Fry," But, what if I forget the sweet sound of her voice or the moist touch of her eyeball on my lips?
",98,89,6,1,Bender,Bender18517,Bender," Aw! Are you still hung up on Whatshername? Move on already!
",61,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18518,Fry," Maybe you're right.
",21,89,6,1,Bender,Bender18519,Bender," Maybe I'm always right.
",25,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18520,Fry," Build-A-Bot Workshop? It's time to start living again!
",56,89,6,1,Bender,Fry18521,Fry," At least it's something to distract me from Leela.  Nah.  Now that I like for some reason.
",92,89,6,1,Fry,Robot #1 Leela18522,Robot #1 Leela,"  I like jellybeans. Do you?
",29,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18523,Fry," I sure do, honey.
",19,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Farnsworth18524,Farnsworth," Come now, Fry!  You can't live out this sick fantasy!  Not without our help.
",78,89,6,1,Fry,Hermes18525,Hermes," These security tapes record everything at Planet Express. Including the ship, shower, and urinals.
Amy: And yet, it still hasn't stopped the elusive bathroom burglar.
",168,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Zoidberg18526,Zoidberg,"  Maybe he's just trying to feed his family. 
",46,89,6,1,Hermes,Hermes18527,Hermes," Computer, analyze tapes and extract personality profile of one Turanga Leela.
",79,89,6,1,Zoidberg,Computer18528,Computer," Analyzing...analyzing...Checking my eBay bid.  Dammit. Analysis complete.
",75,89,6,1,Hermes,Fry18529,Fry," Hey, I was nuzzling that!
Computer: Attributes transferred...Shoe size 12...etc.
",82,89,6,1,Computer,Robot #1 Leela18530,Robot #1 Leela," Brace for emergency landing! What? We survived the crash? Oh, Fry! 
",69,89,6,1,Fry,Bender18531,Bender," Party people in the house say, 
",33,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Robot #1 Leela18532,Robot #1 Leela," This is wonderful! The last thing I remember I was dying in an explosion. Yet here I am in the flesh more alive than ever!
",124,89,6,1,Bender,Fry18533,Fry," Alive? 
",9,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Hermes18534,Hermes," You better tell her, Fry.
",27,89,6,1,Fry,Robot #1 Leela18535,Robot #1 Leela," Tell me what?
",15,89,6,1,Hermes,Hermes18536,Hermes," Anyway, my work is done. I'm gonna hit the showers.
",53,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Robot #1 Leela18537,Robot #1 Leela," Nibbler, come give mama a hug!  Ow! What theâ€”?! Bad Nibbler! Bad Nibbler!  What are you doing, pooperdoodle? It's me, Leela.
Robot Leela: Am I really just a robot? I mean, I have Leela's memories!  Her opinion of gazelles!   Her emotions! 
",241,89,6,1,Hermes,Fry18538,Fry," I swear.  I didn't know this would happen.  The only thing I truly know is I love you.  I mean herâ€”Wait, help me out here.
",124,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Bender18539,Bender," Do the Bender! Do the Bender!
",31,89,6,1,Fry,Randy18540,Randy," No thank you.
",15,89,6,1,Bender,Bender18541,Bender,"  I said, ""Do it!""
Robot Leela: The truth is, Fry, I still have feelings for you.  But are they really my feelings? Am I just an automaton or can a machine of sufficient complexity legitimately achieve consciousness?
",217,89,6,1,Randy,Fry18542,Fry," I agree.
",10,89,6,1,Bender,Robot #1 Leela18543,Robot #1 Leela," I need some time to figure this out.  Until then,  friends?
",61,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18544,Fry,"  Okay.
",8,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Bender18545,Bender," Listen up, disco dummies, you just flunked outta Bender's College for Party Knowledge!
",88,89,6,1,Fry,Bender18546,Bender," Do the back dance! Do the back dance! Ooh....
",47,89,6,1,Bender,Farnsworth18547,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone...
Farnsworth : I'm going to make one final attempt to awaken Leela.  After all, there's always hope.
",123,89,6,1,Bender,Fry18548,Fry," Really?
",9,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18549,Farnsworth,"  No, don't get your hopes up. Frankly, she's just a brainless mound of scabs and pus.
",87,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18550,Fry,"  Oh! I didn't need to hear that.
",34,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18551,Farnsworth," No, and you don't need to see this.
",37,89,6,1,Fry,Machine18552,Machine," Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

",59,89,6,1,Machine,Farnsworth18554,Farnsworth," Well, that's it. I'm afraid traditional medicine has failed.
",62,89,6,1,Machine,Fry18555,Fry," No!  I refuse to give up! Wake up, Leela!  I! Love! You!
",58,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Robot #1 Leela18556,Robot #1 Leela," Fry, stop. She's gone.
",24,89,6,1,Fry,Farnsworth18557,Farnsworth," Dr. Zoidberg, can you note the time and declare the patient legally dead?
",75,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Zoidberg18558,Zoidberg," Can I? That's my specialty.
",29,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Hermes18559,Hermes," As you all know, Leela's living will states that in the event of coma, her body is to be fed to the wild Cyclophage, a highly endangered creature that eats only cyclopses.
",173,89,6,1,Zoidberg,Bender18560,Bender,"  Yep, that's what her donor card says. 
",41,89,6,1,Hermes,Fry18561,Fry,"  Goodbye, my love. 
",21,89,6,1,Bender,Farnsworth18562,Farnsworth," The beast aproacheth.
",23,89,6,1,Fry,Bender18563,Bender," To the beat y'all! To the beat y'all! I'm dancin' a jig wid ma feets y'all!
",77,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Amy18564,Amy," Bender, cut it out! People are trying to have emotions!
",57,89,6,1,Bender,Bender18565,Bender," You think I wanna party?  I'm sick of partying!  Woohoo! More partying! 
",74,89,6,1,Amy,Leela18566,Leela," Bender, shut the hell up!
",27,89,6,1,Bender,Farnsworth18567,Farnsworth," Bender, stop shutting the hell up!
",36,89,6,1,Leela,Bender18568,Bender," Oh, right.  Leela's back. As if I care. Woo.
",46,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Leela18569,Leela," Thanks. It's so nice to wake up and seeâ€” 
",43,89,6,1,Bender,Fry18570,Fry," Leela?!
",9,89,6,1,Leela,Robot #1 Leela18571,Robot #1 Leela," Leela?
",8,89,6,1,Fry,Leela18572,Leela,"  Leela?
",9,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Hermes18573,Hermes," Leela.
",8,89,6,1,Leela,Leela18574,Leela,"  How is this possible? And can you believe she wore a tank top to my funeral?
",79,89,6,1,Hermes,Robot #1 Leela18575,Robot #1 Leela," Shut up!  We gotta get outta here!
",36,89,6,1,Leela,Leela18576,Leela,"  No, you ""Shut up! We gotta get outta here!""
Bender: Ooh, yeah, baby, come on!
",80,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Bender18577,Bender," All aboard the party ship!
Leela: There's no room for two captains' butts in this chair!
",90,89,6,1,Leela,Robot #1 Leela18578,Robot #1 Leela," There would be if you'd taken a spin class instead of lounging around in a coma!
",82,89,6,1,Bender,Leela18579,Leela," This is crazy.
",16,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Leela18580,Leela," It's like I'm looking at an exact robot duplicate of myself.
",62,89,6,1,Leela,Farnsworth18581,Farnsworth," That is what you're looking at.
",33,89,6,1,Leela,Leela18582,Leela," Oh.  How could you do this, Fry?
",34,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Fry18583,Fry," Uh, coma. Sad.
",16,89,6,1,Leela,Robot #1 Leela18584,Robot #1 Leela," I have to go!  This is just too freaky! 
",42,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18585,Fry," Don't get upset, Leela.  She's nothing like you.
",50,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Leela18586,Leela," I have to go!  This is just too freaky! 
",42,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18587,Fry," I need cheering up, Bender.  I dunno.  You wanna go out and party tonight?
",76,89,6,1,Leela,Bender18588,Bender,"  I hate partying!  If only I didn't have so much crunk in my badunkadunk!  Ooh, yeah! Come on, babe!
",102,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18589,Fry," Why does everything I date run away?  I love Leela, always and forever.  And if I loved Robot Leela, too...
",109,89,6,1,Bender,Fry18590,Fry," ...well, that's only 'cause she had so much of real Leela in her.  I thought she loved me, too, but, obviously, I was wrong as usual.
",135,89,6,1,Fry,Leela18591,Leela," Wrong again.  You were right.
",31,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18592,Fry," Leela?  Leela Leela?
",22,89,6,1,Leela,Leela18593,Leela," Leela Leela.  I've been thinking, Fry, if I lost you, I don't think I could stand it, either.  I'd probably build a copy of you, too.  As long as Robo-Leela's not a jealous type like me, thing will worâ€”
",204,89,6,1,Fry,Robot #1 Leela18594,Robot #1 Leela," I'll kill you, you slut-clops!  Hee-ya!  He's mine!
",53,89,6,1,Leela,Leela18595,Leela," Oh, back off, missy!
",22,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Amy18596,Amy," Somebody do something!  Here, take this.
",42,89,6,1,Leela,Fry18597,Fry," A gun?!  D-Do I really need toâ€”?
",34,89,6,1,Amy,Leela18598,Leela," Shoot her!  She's the robot!
",30,89,6,1,Fry,Robot #1 Leela18599,Robot #1 Leela," No, shoot her!  She's the human!
",34,89,6,1,Leela,Fry18600,Fry," But-But how do I know who's the human and who's the robot?
",60,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Leela18601,Leela," We just told you!
",19,89,6,1,Fry,Robot #1 Leela18602,Robot #1 Leela," Yeah, you idiot!
",18,89,6,1,Leela,Fry18603,Fry," Okay. Fine. If you're gonna be like that, I'm not shooting anyone.  Whoa! Right between the lungs. Man, that was close. 
",122,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Fry18604,Fry," I'm a robot, too!
",19,89,6,1,Fry,Zoidberg18605,Zoidberg,"  Aha!  That explains this growth on your drive shaft.
",55,89,6,1,Fry,Robot #1 Fry18606,Robot #1 Fry," But how is this possible?
",27,89,6,1,Zoidberg,Farnsworth18607,Farnsworth," Who knows?  Oh, I do.  Allow me to explain what really happened the day the ship crashed.
",91,89,6,1,Robot #1 Fry,Fry18608,Fry," I'll protect you, Leela!  My love is stronger than the vast majority of explosions!
",85,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18609,Farnsworth," Fry did in fact save Leela, though at a terrible cost to himself.  I tossed him into the stem cells but he just bubbled away like phlegm on a hot sidewalk.
Farnsworth : Leela was so upset, she went all Blade Runner and built a duplicate...
",241,89,6,1,Fry,Farnsworth18610,Farnsworth," ...then uploaded his personality from the urinal surveillance tapes.
",70,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Fry18611,Fry,"  I sure love Leela.
",21,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18612,Farnsworth," Alas, in recreating Fry's adorable jelly belly, she had overstuffed him with copper wadding.
",94,89,6,1,Fry,Farnsworth18613,Farnsworth," The inevitable static discharged electrocuted Leela and destroyed both of their short-term memories.
",102,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Robot #1 Fry18614,Robot #1 Fry," So that's why I'm so amazed by these things I already knew.
",61,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18615,Farnsworth," What could I do?  I hung up Leela with the other bone bags and went to procure the final ingredient for my stem cell brew.
",124,89,6,1,Robot #1 Fry,Robot #1 Fry18616,Robot #1 Fry," Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy.

",24,89,6,1,Leela,Robot #1 Fry18619,Robot #1 Fry," Fry!
",6,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18620,Fry,"  Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was already here. Wait, what's with all the Leelas?
",88,89,6,1,Robot #1 Fry,Robot #1 Fry18621,Robot #1 Fry," Trust me, don't ask.
",22,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18622,Fry," Okay, dork. Listen, I'm gonna hit the urinal, maybe talk about myself a little bit, thenâ€”
",91,89,6,1,Robot #1 Fry,Robot #1 Leela18623,Robot #1 Leela," Hang on!  It's time to sort things out.  The truth is I love Fry.  That Fry.
",78,89,6,1,Fry,Robot #1 Fry18624,Robot #1 Fry," And I love Leela.  Any Leela.
",31,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Robot #1 Leela18625,Robot #1 Leela," We're robots and we're in love. Let's ditch these meat jackets.
",65,89,6,1,Robot #1 Fry,Robot #1 Fry18626,Robot #1 Fry," Whoa, cool!
",13,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Robot #1 Fry18627,Robot #1 Fry,"  Hasta la vista, wiener!
",26,89,6,1,Robot #1 Fry,Robot #1 Leela18628,Robot #1 Leela,"  We'll be back...for our stuff.
",33,89,6,1,Robot #1 Fry,Amy18629,Amy," Why did their voices change?
",30,89,6,1,Robot #1 Leela,Farnsworth18630,Farnsworth," That's the one thing we'll never truly understand.
",52,89,6,1,Amy,Fry18631,Fry," Uh, this is a bit awkward.  Or is it?
",39,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Leela18632,Leela," I'm not sure. I lost track around the second robot.
",53,89,6,1,Fry,Fry18633,Fry," Well, you know how I feel.  I waited for you for a thousand years.  I can wait a little longer.
",97,89,6,1,Leela,Bender18634,Bender," Pffft!  What a load of mush!  I've had it!
",44,89,6,1,Fry,Amy18635,Amy," He's gonna blow!
",18,89,6,1,Bender,Farnsworth18636,Farnsworth," Party, Bender!  Party for your life!
",38,89,6,1,Amy,Bender18637,Bender," No chance, hot pants!  I'd rather die and kill all of you than party for one more millisecond!
",96,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Leela18638,Leela," The cyclops eater!
",20,89,6,1,Bender,Bender18639,Bender," Hold on, mac!  It ain't like that!
",36,89,6,1,Leela,Bender18640,Bender," Geez, what's it take to kill me?
",34,89,6,1,Bender,Farnsworth18641,Farnsworth," Bender, you blew out your excess capacity!  You're cured!
",59,89,6,1,Bender,Bender18642,Bender,"  Oh, sweet mercy.  My hellish nightmare is over. I never have to party again.
",79,89,6,1,Farnsworth,Fry18643,Fry," Well, that's that, then.  We're back, everyone!
",49,89,6,1,Bender,Bender18644,Bender," Party!!
",9,89,6,1,Fry,Zapp18645,Zapp," Wheeee!
",9,89,6,1,Bender,Transition Announcer #118646,Transition Announcer #1," And now, The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan!  Brought to you by Bartley's Rocket Wax.
",97,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18647,Zapp,"  I wax my rocket every day.
",29,90,6,2,Transition Announcer #1,Emperor Chop Chop18648,Emperor Chop Chop," No one can save you now, Leela.
",33,90,6,2,Zapp,LeelaActress18649,LeelaActress," Well, what about Zapp Brannigan?
",34,90,6,2,Emperor Chop Chop,Emperor Chop Chop18650,Emperor Chop Chop," Well, obviously, Zapp Brannigan can save you, butâ€”  Zapp Brannigan!
",69,90,6,2,LeelaActress,Zapp18651,Zapp," So, Emperor Chop Chop, once again we meet at last! Drop that space gun or I'll shoot!  Like so! 
",98,90,6,2,Emperor Chop Chop,LeelaActress18652,LeelaActress," Oh, Zapp!  Tie me back up and ravish me!
",42,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18653,Zapp," I'd like to, Leela.  So I will.
",33,90,6,2,LeelaActress,Zapp18654,Zapp," Ooh, yeah, shake it, baby. Shake it likeâ€”   I surrender and volunteer for treason!
",84,90,6,2,Zapp,Kif18655,Kif,"  Emergency summons from the President, captain.
",49,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18656,Zapp," Oh, it's you.  Just let me freshen up.  Computer, captain's musk.
",67,90,6,2,Kif,Zapp18657,Zapp," The long dramatic corridor.  That's never a good sign.
",56,90,6,2,Zapp,Scanner18658,Scanner," Glove recognized. Proceed, Mrs. Eisenhower.
Zapp: Mr. President, what the hell?
",81,90,6,2,Zapp,Nixon18659,Nixon," At ease, Brannigan.
",21,90,6,2,Scanner,Nixon18660,Nixon," What you're about to see is highly classified. Reptillicus, hit the thingy.
",77,90,6,2,Nixon,Nixon18661,Nixon,"  At 0000 hours, Planet XXX was attacked by a mysterious death sphere. 
",72,90,6,2,Nixon,Zapp18662,Zapp,"  Magnify that death sphere.  Why's it still blurry?
",53,90,6,2,Nixon,Kif18663,Kif," That's all the resolution we have. Making it bigger doesn't make it clearer.
",78,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18664,Zapp," It does on CSI: Miami.
",24,90,6,2,Kif,Nixon18665,Nixon," They fought back with advance military hardware, but it was like shooting BB's at Bebe Rebozo.
",96,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18666,Zapp," That poor brave hardware.
",27,90,6,2,Nixon,Nixon18667,Nixon," The sphere then fired some kind of hellish blackout ray.  Erased that planet like eighteen minutes of incriminating tape.
",123,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18668,Zapp," Oh, I just wish I understood why.  Why I should care.
",55,90,6,2,Nixon,Nixon18669,Nixon," Because the death sphere is now on course for Earth! Rowrowooooooo!!
",70,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18670,Zapp," My god, we're defenseless. Like fish in a barrel.
",51,90,6,2,Nixon,Nixon18671,Nixon," Options?
",10,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18672,Zapp," My instinct is to hide in this barrel.  Like the wily fish.
",61,90,6,2,Nixon,Nixon18673,Nixon,"  Then we're down to our last hope.  A radical new weapon built by a visionary scientist I once dismissed as crazy.
",116,90,6,2,Zapp,Farnsworth18674,Farnsworth," Let's see how crazy I am now, Nixon!  The correct answer is: very.
",68,90,6,2,Nixon,Nixon18675,Nixon," Alright, Professor. Sock it to me!
",36,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18676,Farnsworth," Top secret news, everyone! I've developed a tiny one-man stealth fighter that's virtually undetectable.
",105,90,6,2,Nixon,Zapp18677,Zapp,"  How undetectable?
",20,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18678,Farnsworth," It's right in front of you.
",29,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18679,Zapp,"  I find thatâ€”OW! â€”to believe.
",31,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Bender18680,Bender," But how exactly is this Happy Meal toy gonna destroy a giant death sphere?
",76,90,6,2,Zapp,Farnsworth18681,Farnsworth," From within.  This ship should be able to sneak undetected through the sphere's one vulnerable opening.
",105,90,6,2,Bender,Hermes18682,Hermes," What vulnerable opening?
",26,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18683,Farnsworth," All death spheres have one vulnerable opening.
",48,90,6,2,Hermes,Zoidberg18684,Zoidberg," Well, sure, but who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a ""death sphere""?
",96,90,6,2,Farnsworth,NIxon18685,NIxon," I say Brannigan.
",18,90,6,2,Zoidberg,Zapp18686,Zapp,"  I say no.
",12,90,6,2,NIxon,Leela18687,Leela," I say me.
",11,90,6,2,Zapp,Nixon18688,Nixon," I say Leela.
",14,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18689,Leela," I say yes.
",12,90,6,2,Nixon,Fry18690,Fry," I say no.
",11,90,6,2,Leela,Zapp18691,Zapp," I say Leela, too.
",19,90,6,2,Fry,Leela18692,Leela," I say yes again.
",18,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18693,Zapp," I say I shall join her.
",25,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18694,Leela," But it's only a one-man craft...I say.
",40,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18695,Zapp," There'll only be one man.  Me.  How would you feel if I rode rear as your personal tail gunner?
",97,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18696,Leela," Creeped out.
",14,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18697,Zapp," Then it's decided.
",20,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18698,Leela,"  Are you sure I have to sit in your lap?
",42,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18699,Zapp," It'll help us achieve maximum thrust.
",39,90,6,2,Leela,Fry18700,Fry,"  I made you some trail mix for the flight.  Also this picture to remember me by.
",82,90,6,2,Zapp,Leela18701,Leela," You hold on to it.  I'll be back soon.
",40,90,6,2,Fry,Farnsworth18702,Farnsworth,"  Activate stealth shielding.
",30,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18703,Leela," Liftoff!
",10,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Zapp18704,Zapp," I'll rodger that.
",19,90,6,2,Leela,Fry18705,Fry," Did anyone else feel aroused and jealous and worried?
",55,90,6,2,Zapp,Bender18706,Bender," I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.
",59,90,6,2,Fry,Leela18707,Leela," Death sphere in range.  Engaging holographic targeting.   Activating the Force.
",81,90,6,2,Bender,The Force18708,The Force,"  Feel the entrance, Leela. Destination on your left in...  zero point three  miles.
",85,90,6,2,Leela,Zapp18709,Zapp," Zapp to Leela: look at all that surveillance equipment.
",57,90,6,2,The Force,Leela18710,Leela,"  We better whisper.
",21,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18711,Zapp," Switching to pillow talk mode.
",32,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18712,Leela," Look.  What are those huge letters?
",37,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18713,Zapp," ""V-GINY?"" Doesn't ring a bell.
",32,90,6,2,Leela,Farnsworth18714,Farnsworth," Hmmm....
",10,90,6,2,Zapp,Farnsworth18715,Farnsworth," I don't like the looks of this ""V-GINY.""  Does anyone recognize those call letters?
",85,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Hermes18716,Hermes," Nope.  It's not in the Janeway's Guide either.
",48,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18717,Farnsworth," Deciphering that ID code is critical.  I'll be in the Chamber of Understanding.
",81,90,6,2,Hermes,Leela18718,Leela," This is it! The moment we should've trained for!
",50,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Leela18719,Leela," Holy crâ€”
",10,90,6,2,Leela,Zapp18720,Zapp," Incoming yucky!
",17,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18721,Leela," Firing pocket rocket!
",23,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18722,Zapp," Don't panic, Leela! Go go go go go!
",37,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18723,Leela," I hope this is the control stick!
",35,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18724,Zapp," Captain's Log: We've lost control.  Addendum: Whoooaa-oooooaa-ooaaaah!!!
",74,90,6,2,Leela,Transition Announcer #118725,Transition Announcer #1," And now, back to The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan!
",64,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18726,Zapp,"  Chapter Two: ""The Heat Thickens"".
",36,90,6,2,Transition Announcer #1,Zapp18727,Zapp," Leela, wake up! I can't face this mysterious planet alone without you or someone like you.
",92,90,6,2,Zapp,Leela18728,Leela," Zapp?  Zapp, wake up!
",23,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18729,Zapp," Leela? Where are we.
",22,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18730,Leela," We crashed on an uncharted planet.  When I woke up, I was pinned under this tree. Can you help me?
",100,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18731,Zapp,"  If anyone can move it, I can.  No one can move it. Are you hurt?
",67,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18732,Leela," No. But I'm so thirsty.  This spacesuit is making me sweat like a sow.
",72,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18733,Zapp," Me, too. We better strip them off and continue surviving au naturel.
",70,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18734,Leela," Uh, I suppose so.
",19,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18735,Zapp," Here.  We can cover ourselves with these sticky sap-covered leaves.  I'll try to avert my eyes from your nudery.
",114,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18736,Leela," You will?  Eh, what's the point? You'll have to look sooner or later.
",71,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18737,Zapp," Well, I promise not to abuse the privilege. For now, I better scout around for food and water and help.
",105,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18738,Leela," What a thoughtful and considerate thing to say.  What the hell's wrong with you?
",82,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18739,Zapp," I'm not quite sure. Perhaps it's the fresh air or a severe head injury.  In any case, I'm off.
",96,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18740,Leela,"  If you see any steaks, that'd be good!
",41,90,6,2,Zapp,Fry18741,Fry," Why isn't Leela back yet?  Do you think she's okay?
",53,90,6,2,Leela,Bender18742,Bender," How should I know?  And how come you never ask if I'm okay?  I'm feelin' a little neglected here!
",99,90,6,2,Fry,Fry18743,Fry," Oh, sorry. Are you okay, Bender?
",34,90,6,2,Bender,Bender18744,Bender," Shut up!
",10,90,6,2,Fry,Hermes18745,Hermes," What difference does it make?  When that death sphere gets to Earth, we'll all be blown to Manwich meat!
",106,90,6,2,Bender,Amy18746,Amy," Well, I guess it's time to indulge in some end-of-the-world debauchery.  Who's up for an orgy?
",96,90,6,2,Hermes,Zoidberg18747,Zoidberg," Maybe a Parcheesi tournament.
",31,90,6,2,Amy,Farnsworth18748,Farnsworth," Belay that Parcheesi tournament! I've identified the death sphere! We may yet have a faint hope of survival!
",110,90,6,2,Zoidberg,Zoidberg18749,Zoidberg," Still, a Parcheesi tournament.
",32,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18750,Farnsworth," This is a top secret military satellite launched by the Air Force in 1998.
",76,90,6,2,Zoidberg,Farnsworth18751,Farnsworth," And this is a top secret FCC satellite launched that same year to censor indecent TV programs.
",96,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Bender18752,Bender," Like The Pimpsons? And Assarama?
",34,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18753,Farnsworth," Precisely.  However, the satellites collided shortly after launch and were never heard from again.
",100,90,6,2,Bender,Zoidberg18754,Zoidberg," I found the board!
",20,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18755,Farnsworth," Now, I've simulated that collision using Shrapnovision.
",57,90,6,2,Zoidberg,Fry18756,Fry,"  Granted, all that makes perfect sense, but why is this death sphere destroying planets?
",90,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18757,Farnsworth," That makes the most sense of all.  Look at the planets it's destroyed so far.  First came XXX, the nude beach planet.  Then Poopiter.  â‚¬$!#%&"" comes on screen.] And finally that world that can't be mentioned in polite company.
",228,90,6,2,Fry,Fry18758,Fry," You mean...
",13,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Amy18759,Amy," Aw!
",5,90,6,2,Fry,Farnsworth18760,Farnsworth," How dare you!?
",16,90,6,2,Amy,Amy18761,Amy," Shame onâ€”
",11,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Hermes18762,Hermes," So the death sphere is ""censoring"" indecent planets?
",54,90,6,2,Amy,Farnsworth18763,Farnsworth," Indeed.  And we're next if we can't keep it in our collective pants!  Our sole hope is to persuade the people of Earth to abandon their smutty ways.
",150,90,6,2,Hermes,Amy18764,Amy," So the orgy's off?
",20,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Leela18765,Leela," So thirsty.  Why couldn't a water fountain have fallen on me?
",63,90,6,2,Amy,Zapp18766,Zapp," I couldn't find any water.  But the moisture in these fruit and nut berries should sustain you.
",97,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18767,Leela," Thank you.  
",14,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18768,Zapp," I climbed perilously high into the trees to pick them, yet I saw no sign of intelligent life.
",95,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18769,Leela," Bummer.
",9,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18770,Zapp," Moreover, the crash totally destroyed our ship.
",49,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18771,Leela," So we're stuck here until someone finds us?
",45,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18772,Zapp," Alas, that may never happen.  Stealth technology makes the ship impossible to locate yet easy to stub your crotch on.
",119,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18773,Leela," Well, there's worse places to be marooned.  Plenty of food, mild climate.
",75,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18774,Zapp," It's a veritable Garden of Eden.
",34,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18775,Leela," It is?
",8,90,6,2,Zapp,Snake18776,Snake," Hello.
",8,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18777,Leela," Did that snake say, ""Hello""?
",30,90,6,2,Snake,Zapp18778,Zapp," No, we're both delirious from dehydration.
",44,90,6,2,Leela,Snake18779,Snake," Just like Adam and Eve.
",25,90,6,2,Zapp,Farnsworth18780,Farnsworth," We can still save Earth.  People are sure to clean up their act when presented with cold hard facts by rational folks like us.
",128,90,6,2,Snake,Farnsworth18781,Farnsworth," The end is near! Repent thy sins!
",35,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Sal18782,Sal,"  I'll thinks it overs while I engages this five dollar hooker.
",64,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Fry18783,Fry,"  Don't do it! It's not worth it!
",34,90,6,2,Sal,Petunia18784,Petunia," Okay, make it three dollars.
",30,90,6,2,Fry,Sal18785,Sal," Yuck! I don't wants no three-dollar hooker.  I'm goin' backs to the adults bookstore.
",87,90,6,2,Petunia,Fry18786,Fry," Adult bookstore?  I thought this was the public library.
",58,90,6,2,Sal,Bender18787,Bender,"  Nope, pubic library.
",23,90,6,2,Fry,Leela18788,Leela," Zapp?  Where are you?  Oh, God, I'm actually starting to miss him.
",68,90,6,2,Bender,Snake18789,Snake," Maybe you two belong together.
",32,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18790,Leela," We do not.  And you can't talk.
",33,90,6,2,Snake,Snake18791,Snake," Oh, come on!  It must be an awful temptation. 
Zapp: Guess who just killed a woodchuck with his bare feet?  I thought I'd whip us up some shelter, make this a little more like home.
",183,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18792,Leela," I do miss the Earth terribly.  I wonder if it's even still there.
",67,90,6,2,Snake,Zapp18793,Zapp," Let's find out together.  I'll brave the ship's wreckage to fetch you the telescope. 
",87,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18794,Leela," That's so sweet.
",18,90,6,2,Zapp,Snake18795,Snake," I'm just sayin' is all.
",25,90,6,2,Leela,Farnsworth18796,Farnsworth," I know my new plan is a long shot, but it's the only hope left.
",65,90,6,2,Snake,Hermes18797,Hermes," Well, now I've heard everything  on my eyePod.  So, do you have a new plan, Professor, and is there any hope left?
",116,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth18798,Farnsworth," Indeed.  We're here on Earth's last unspoiled acre to show the death sphere there's still purity in the world.  Begin transmitting.
",133,90,6,2,Hermes,Farnsworth18799,Farnsworth," Commence purity chant.
",24,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Fry18800,Fry," Hey, I'm proud of you, Bender. Avoiding sin for almost a full minute.   Bender?
",81,90,6,2,Farnsworth,Bender18801,Bender," Aw, yeah, baby. You're quite a dish.
Farnsworth: Bender, stop!! STOP!!
",72,90,6,2,Fry,Bender18802,Bender," Aw, quiet, you riot.  What's the worst that could happen?
",59,90,6,2,Bender,Leela18803,Leela," No!
",5,90,6,2,Bender,Leela18804,Leela," No!  Earth is gone!  We're the only two humans left in the universe! 
",71,90,6,2,Leela,Zapp18805,Zapp," Oh, God, I'm sorry, Leela. 
",29,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18806,Leela," Maybe â€” Maybe this was meant to be. Maybe you and I were meant to build a new world here.

",24,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18811,Zapp," And we'll beget little Zapp Jr. and Leela Jr. and they'll have kids of their owâ€”Yecch!  Is that really what happened in the Bible?!
",133,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18812,Leela," It's a sick and twisted book of holiness all right.
",53,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18813,Zapp," Then we'll write our own Bible, with less Sodom and more Gomorra.
",67,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18814,Leela," Let's do it.  I shall become the mother of a new world, trapped here under this tree.  The Tree of Knowledge!  Look, it even has apples!  Ow!  Wow!  Come here, Adam, partake of my forbidden fruit.
",198,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18815,Zapp," Thee will be done.
",20,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18816,Leela," Wait!  One more bite before we begin the begetting.   Mmm, juicy.  Those nut berries you found were so salty, Iâ€”I couldn't think straight.  I mean, not to belabor it, but they were as salty as that bag of trail mix Fry gave me.  Exactly as salty.  Hey!  Wait a second! 
",271,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18817,Zapp," Uh...woh...ih...Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiihâ€”I have a terrible confession to make!
",83,90,6,2,Leela,Zapp18818,Zapp," You see, when I first went foraging, what I actually found was the smoldering wreckage of the ship.  Ignoring all danger, I charged inside to liberate our provisions.
",168,90,6,2,Zapp,Leela18819,Leela," So this is the trail mix Fry gave me!
",39,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18820,Zapp," Yes!  I exaggerated when I said I picked it from the treetops.  I just wanted you to think  a little better of me.
",116,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18821,Leela," Well, your motives were good.  And we were both loopy from dehydration.  Hey, wait!  You've been doing an awful lot of urinating!
",131,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18822,Zapp," Ooooooiiiiiiigeeeaaaaaaaaaah, there's plenty of water! You see...
Zapp : ...after I selflessly rescued the trail mix, I braved the flames once more in search of fluids.
",170,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18823,Leela," Then why didn't you give me any?
",34,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18824,Zapp,"  I though it might help you forget your intense hatred for me if you were a teensy bit delirious.
",99,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18825,Leela," So you let me dehydrate while you washed down the trail mix with imported mineral water?
",90,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18826,Zapp," Diiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaah, not exactly.
Zapp : You see, besides the trail mix, the minibar also contained Doritos, beef jerky and a generous assortment of fine chocolates.
",168,90,6,2,Leela,Zapp18827,Zapp," I wanted to offer you the chocolates, I truly did.  But I was concerned about your waistline.  Very concerned.
",112,90,6,2,Zapp,Leela18828,Leela," It's because I haven't been exercising.  If only this tree hadn't fallen on me by chance.   Oh, dear God!
",107,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18829,Zapp," Gluuuuuuuuyiiiiiiiiiiiih, it was just after we crashed!
",57,90,6,2,Leela,Zapp18830,Zapp," I awoke first to find you trapped.
",36,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18831,Zapp," Leela.  Leela! Wake up!
",25,90,6,2,Zapp,Leela18832,Leela," You could've moved this grub-infested log anytime you wanted?!
",64,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18833,Zapp," Well, sure.  But then I wouldn't have been able to provide the loving care you wouldn't have needed.
",102,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18834,Leela," I'd leave you to rot in this paradise if only the ship weren't destroyed!  The ship's fully functional, isn't it?
",115,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18835,Zapp," Ee-iiiiiiiiiiiiiiih, you see...
",33,90,6,2,Leela,Zapp18836,Zapp," ...after re-trapping you and before feigning unconsciousness, I paused to enjoy a cigar.  Though mellow and satisfying, it did parch me a bit.  So I went in search of brandy.  That's when my keen senses detected the still invisible ship.
",239,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18837,Zapp," Ow!
",5,90,6,2,Zapp,Leela18838,Leela," So we can go back to Earth?  But there is no Earth anymore!  Everyone I know is dead! 
",88,90,6,2,Zapp,Fry18839,Fry," Ah, this seems like a good place to take a dump.  Leela? You're alive! 
",73,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18840,Leela," Fry!  But how did you find this planet?  Well?
",48,90,6,2,Fry,Zapp18841,Zapp," Oooheeeeeeaaaaiiiiiiih, we're actually on Earth!  The ship's homing device brought us back!
",93,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18842,Leela," But I saw Earth explode!
",26,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18843,Zapp,"  I'm actually kinda proud of this one.  You see...
",52,90,6,2,Leela,Zapp18844,Zapp," What you saw was merely a simulation I rigged up using the ship's holographic targeting projector.  The alleged telescope was a toilet paper tube.
",148,90,6,2,Zapp,Leela18845,Leela," You said there wasn't any toilet paper!  And that humanity was annihilated!
",77,90,6,2,Zapp,Zapp18846,Zapp," My motives were pure!  I just wanted you think we had to save humanity so you'd be willing to have sex.  Please say you believe me.
",133,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18847,Leela," Yes.  I believe you.
",22,90,6,2,Zapp,Fry18848,Fry," Yay!
",6,90,6,2,Leela,Bender18849,Bender," There must be somethin' to steal on this island.  Hey, it's Leela!
Leela: Let's go home, everybody.  At least the Earth wasn't destroyed.  Yet.

",35,90,6,2,V-GINY,V-GINY18854,V-GINY," Unacceptable wardrobe malfunction!  I was referring to Adam and Eve.

",49,90,6,2,Leela,Leela18857,Leela," Well, if it's to save Earth, I-I guess I could take one for the team.

Leela: Granted, we later learned some positive things about recycling.  But a better solution is to use our electronics as long as possible, instead of throwing them out in the first place.   I'm gonna start by keeping my old cell phone, even if it is outdated.

",21,92,6,4,Amy,Leela19177,Leela," Okay, good. On three. One.
",28,92,6,4,Zoidberg,Hermes19178,Hermes," What did she say?
",19,92,6,4,Leela,Leela19179,Leela," Two.
",6,92,6,4,Hermes,Bender19180,Bender," Wait, I'm not in position. 
",29,92,6,4,Leela,Leela19181,Leela," Three.
",8,92,6,4,Bender,Zoidberg19182,Zoidberg," I'm ready for the countdown.
",30,92,6,4,Leela,Leela19183,Leela," I'm not hearing anyone! Abort mission!
",40,92,6,4,Zoidberg,Fry19184,Fry," She said, ""Go!""
",17,92,6,4,Leela,Farnsworth19185,Farnsworth," Good work, everyone. 
",23,92,6,4,Fry,Leela19186,Leela," Honestly, that went better than I expected.
",45,92,6,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19187,Farnsworth," I just need to reduce it down into this pickle jar, toss in a bay leaf to impress those stupid judges. 
",105,92,6,4,Leela,Fry19188,Fry," Hey, where's Amy and Bender?
",30,92,6,4,Farnsworth,Zoidberg19189,Zoidberg," They're missing out on some hot pickle action. 
",49,92,6,4,Fry,Hermes19190,Hermes," Sounds like a muskrat's caught in there.
",42,92,6,4,Zoidberg,Leela19191,Leela," That's Amy's sweatshirt!
",26,92,6,4,Hermes,Fry19192,Fry," And that's Bender's hat from the Player's ball!
",49,92,6,4,Leela,Hermes19193,Hermes," Sweet tornadoes of Barbados! Bender and Amy have been torn to shreds!
",71,92,6,4,Fry,Farnsworth19194,Farnsworth,"  Oh, the humanity! Also Bender!
",33,92,6,4,Hermes,Amy19195,Amy,"  Uh-oh!
",9,92,6,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19196,Farnsworth," What's going on here?
",23,92,6,4,Amy,Bender19197,Bender," Uh.  Nothing.
",15,92,6,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19198,Farnsworth," A pair of deviant robosexuals. Not under my roof!
",51,92,6,4,Bender,Bender19199,Bender," What about on the roof?
",25,92,6,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19200,Farnsworth," Get your mind out of the gutter!
",34,92,6,4,Bender,Bender19201,Bender," What about in the gutter?
",27,92,6,4,Farnsworth,Leela19202,Leela," Professor, there is nothing wrong with robosexuality.
",55,92,6,4,Bender,Hermes19203,Hermes," Yeah, when the lights go out, it's nobody's business what happens between two consenting adults.
",98,92,6,4,Leela,Zoidberg19204,Zoidberg," Or one!
",9,92,6,4,Hermes,Amy19205,Amy," Thanks, guys. Everything will be okay just as long as my parents don't find out.

",73,92,6,4,Mrs. Wong,Fry19228,Fry,"  What about this gross, ugly, smelly loser?
",45,92,6,4,Amy,Leo19229,Leo," Fry! What you doing here?
",27,92,6,4,Fry,Fry19230,Fry," I'm here to rescue Amy, uh... from her robosexual desires. 
",61,92,6,4,Leo,Amy19231,Amy," If I understand you correctly, I've seen the error of my ways? 
",65,92,6,4,Fry,Leo19232,Leo," Look at all that awkward winking.
",35,92,6,4,Amy,Mrs. Wong19233,Mrs. Wong," It must be love. 
",19,92,6,4,Leo,Amy19234,Amy," My parents may be evil, but at least they're stupid.
",54,92,6,4,Mrs. Wong,Preacherbot19235,Preacherbot,"  In this phase, you will literally wrestle with your demons. Your shapely, buxom, human demons.

",65,92,6,4,Preacherbot,Preacherbot19237,Preacherbot,"  Good! That's real good!  Okay, everybody switch demons. No point sticking with just one demon.  Now, work it hard! Harder! Till the sin explodes! Ouch! Mmmm. Mercy. Okay, Lord's work is done. Now, now, cuddle. Cuddle with your demons.
",237,92,6,4,Fatbot,Bender19238,Bender," Oh, Amy. I wonder where you are right now!
",44,92,6,4,Preacherbot,Amy19239,Amy," I'm inside the dummy to rescue you.
",37,92,6,4,Bender,Bender19240,Bender," That answers that. Wait... Amy?

",22,92,6,4,Bender,Bender19242,Bender," Fry? Leela? You're in there, too? Blech.
",42,92,6,4,Leela,Zoidberg19243,Zoidberg," I guess we should have waited in the ship.
",44,92,6,4,Bender,Bender19244,Bender," Listen up, everybody, I love Amy and I'm tired of pussyfootcupping around! I finally found someone I want to spend the rest of her life with. Amy,  will you marry me?

",37,92,6,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19248,Farnsworth," Horray denied! Need I remind you that robosexual marriage is illegal!
",71,92,6,4,Zoidberg,Leela19249,Leela," Not in Space Massachusetts.
",29,92,6,4,Farnsworth,Bender19250,Bender," You mean Space-tax-achusetts. No chance, stretch pants! We're gonna fight to legalize it right here!
",102,92,6,4,Leela,Hermes19251,Hermes," Yeah, man! You got to legalize it!
",36,92,6,4,Bender,Amy19252,Amy," We're talking about robosexual marriage.
",42,92,6,4,Hermes,Hermes19253,Hermes," We're talking about lots of stuff.

",27,92,6,4,Amy,Amy19258,Amy," But it's time to discuss a pressing issue, the right to marry who, or what, we want! 
",87,92,6,4,Hedonism Bot,Bender19259,Bender," Every other couple has the right to marry, robot and fembot, 
",63,92,6,4,Amy,Randy19260,Randy," Our poodle has two daddies.
",29,92,6,4,Bender,Bender19261,Bender," Interracial, , Interplanetary, , even ghost and horse,  but not robot and human.
",82,92,6,4,Randy,Amy19262,Amy," That's why we're introducing this ballot initiative to legalize robosexual marriage.
",86,92,6,4,Bender,Bender19263,Bender," If you hate intolerance and begin punched in the face by me, please support Proposition Infinity!
",99,92,6,4,Amy,Bender19264,Bender," Damn it!
Linda:  As election day nears, prop infinity seems doomed to certain defeat.
",87,92,6,4,Bender,Morbo19265,Morbo,"  Doooooooomed!
",16,92,6,4,Bender,Linda19266,Linda,"  More fair and balanced coverage after a word from our sponsor, No on Infinity.
",81,92,6,4,Morbo,Actor 119267,Actor 1," A storm is gathering.
",23,92,6,4,Linda,Actor 219268,Actor 2," A storm of robosexual marriage that will rain down on us like fire.
",69,92,6,4,Actor 1,Actor 119269,Actor 1," It's probably a firestorm.
",28,92,6,4,Actor 2,Actress19270,Actress," If robosexual marriage becomes legal, imagine the horrible things that will happen to our children, then imagine we said those things, since we couldn't think of any. As a mother, those things worry me.
",204,92,6,4,Actor 1,Man #119271,Man #1,"  Vote No on Infinity. Paid for by the Farnsworth Foundation.
",62,92,6,4,Actress,Amy19272,Amy," We can't compete against that much stock footage of clouds! We're boned!
",74,92,6,4,Man #1,Bender19273,Bender," But we still have one hope, my big televised debate! I'm our A in the hole!
",77,92,6,4,Amy,Fry19274,Fry," Professor, who's debating for your side?
",42,92,6,4,Bender,Farnsworth19275,Farnsworth," Oh, that guy, you know, I forget his name.
",44,92,6,4,Fry,Farnsworth19276,Farnsworth,"  That's him!
",14,92,6,4,Farnsworth,George George Takeis head19277,George George Takeis head," Good evening, I'm George Takei's head and neck, your host for tonight's debate. You may applaud.  We flipped a coin before the debate and Bender stole it, so we'll start with him.
",181,92,6,4,Farnsworth,Bender19278,Bender," Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I... Oops. Sorry, force of habit. I support this proposition because I love a goopy, flesh-and-blood woman, and not surprisingly, she loves me. This is a simple matter of justice, which I'm not normally for. So, please, vote yes. After all, our love isn't any different than yours, except it's hotter, 'cause I'm involved.
",358,92,6,4,George George Takeis head,George Takei19279,George Takei," I haven't heard such an eloquent speech since Bill Shatner explained why he couldn't pay me back. Rebuttal, Professor?
",120,92,6,4,Bender,Farnsworth19280,Farnsworth," This $4 coffee pot talks about love, but what he describes is perversion.
",75,92,6,4,George Takei,Bender19281,Bender," You wouldn't know perversion if it put clamps on your testicles! You're just jealous, 'cause you've never known true love.
",124,92,6,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19282,Farnsworth," Oh, no? Back when I was full of piss and vinegar, and my bed wasn't, I fell in love with the sweetest girl to ever skip through a field of posies.  Her name was Eunice, and we spent our blissful days working in a lab, developing a poison to wipe out that dreadful posy infestation.  I thought our love would last forever. But then, 43 years later, she left me  for a robot!  How could she do that to me, her Farnypoo?
",419,92,6,4,Bender,Amy19283,Amy," That's it? You hate robosexual 'cause your girlfriend left you for a robot?
",77,92,6,4,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19284,Farnsworth," She didn't just leave me for a robot. She was a robot!  Oh, God! Her name wasn't Eunice, it was Unit! Unit 47.  My heart was broken, and like a bitter, old picklepuss, I took my anger out on robosexuals everywhere. I'm so ashamed! At the risk of losing this debate, I beg you, support Proposition Infinity. 
",309,92,6,4,Amy,Bender19285,Bender," Give me a hug. 
",17,92,6,4,Farnsworth,George George Takeis head19286,George George Takeis head," I, too, am hugging them in spirit. And now, they're hugging me back. Oh, my!
",78,92,6,4,Bender,Linda19287,Linda,"  In a stunning turnout, voters have approved Proposition Infinity. Robosexual marriage is now legal.
",102,92,6,4,George George Takeis head,Morbo19288,Morbo,"  What's next, gay robosexual marriage?
",40,92,6,4,Linda,Amy19289,Amy," We did it, honey! Finally, we can have a legal, monogamous marriage, like everyone else!
",90,92,6,4,Morbo,Bender19290,Bender," Woo-hoo! Yeah! ... Monogamous? 
",33,92,6,4,Amy,Radio announcer19291,Radio announcer," And now, a long-distance dedication from a squishy, green bad boy to his pink pork dumpling.  At number 12, it's Wailing Fungus with ""Shut Up and Love Me"".
",157,92,6,4,Bender,Wailing Fungus19292,Wailing Fungus,"  I told you where.
I told you when.
I told you how.
And we'll meet up at ten.
But you keep on talkin'.
You keep on yackin'.Chorus: Shut up and love me!  Shut up and love me!
",175,92,6,4,Radio announcer,Morbo19293,Morbo,"  Silence, puny audience. And welcome to Who Dares to be a Millionaire? Tremble before Morbo's mighty likability,  as I chitchat with out first contestant, Philip J. Fry.
",171,93,6,5,Wailing Fungus,Bender19294,Bender,"  Give him hell, Morbo!
",24,93,6,5,Morbo,Morbo19295,Morbo,"  Prepare for pleasantries.  So Fry, what do you do for a living?
",66,93,6,5,Bender,Fry19296,Fry," Me? Um, can I phone a friend?
",31,93,6,5,Morbo,Morbo19297,Morbo,"  Chitchat achieved!  Are you ready to play?
",45,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19298,Fry," I didn't come to play. I came to win. Now let's play.
",55,93,6,5,Morbo,Morbo19299,Morbo," For $1, what tool is used to hammer a nail? Is it, A, a hammer? B, A nail? C...
",81,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19300,Fry," B, nail, final answer! 
",25,93,6,5,Morbo,Hermes19301,Hermes," Sweet dodo of Lesotho! Don't you ever stop to think before you speak?
",71,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19302,Fry," I never stop to think about it.
",33,93,6,5,Hermes,Leela19303,Leela," Aw, leave Fry alone. His intelligence is just a little differenty.
",68,93,6,5,Fry,Bender19304,Bender,"  You big dummy!
",17,93,6,5,Leela,Fry19305,Fry," Hey, I'm begining to think you guys don't think I'm very smart.
",65,93,6,5,Bender,Farnsworth19306,Farnsworth," You can barely remember your own name, Einstein.
",50,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19307,Fry," Einstein is a hard name to remember. . Ow!
",44,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Amy19308,Amy," Smeesh, Professor. Don't have a schmaneurysm. Fry's your distant relative.
",76,93,6,5,Fry,Farnsworth19309,Farnsworth," Not distant enough! I'll be a monkey's uncle if I'm this monkey's nephew!
",75,93,6,5,Amy,Fry19310,Fry,"  But you're my only family. Who will hug me if I achieve something?
",69,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19311,Farnsworth," Oh, perhaps I've been too harsh. Come, lad, take my hand and I'll explain why I find you so repugnant.
",104,93,6,5,Fry,Farnsworth19312,Farnsworth," All my life I've been inspired by great minds. Euclid, Copernicus, Braino. And my personal role model, Leonardo da Vinci. 
",124,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Fry19313,Fry," What turned them to stone?
",28,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19314,Farnsworth,"  da Vinci was history's greatest artist and inventor.  VoilÃ ! He invented flying machines, war engines, submarines.
",117,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19315,Fry,"  Uh-oh! Nibbler died in the wall.
",35,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19316,Farnsworth," That's not Nibbler. That's my most precious possession. Leonardo's beard! I paid a fortune for it at an auction of historic body parts. I suppose if I have an Achilles' heel, it's because I bought it at that same auction. 
",224,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19317,Fry,"  Indeed so. Most indeededly.
",30,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19318,Farnsworth," Careful with that, you fool!  No! No! But possibly yes. 
",58,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19319,Fry," What is it, Professor?
",24,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19320,Farnsworth,"  Oh, my! It's da Vinci's fabled lost invention. Even the scholars who wrote of this device had no idea what it was for. And now, at least, neither do I!
",154,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19321,Fry," Maybe we can figure it out.
",29,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19322,Farnsworth," We? 
",6,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19323,Fry," Well, I may not have brain smarts, but at least I have street smarts. 
",72,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Fry19324,Fry," I was in the hospital two weeks. No one visited me.
",53,93,6,5,Fry,Farnsworth19325,Farnsworth," Quiet, you! I'm trying to deduce the function of da Vinci's lost invention.
",77,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19326,Fry," Not even a card.
",18,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsowrth19327,Farnsowrth," He might have hidden a clue in one of his other works. Ergo, I sent Bender out for a copy of the Last Supper.
",111,93,6,5,Fry,Bender19328,Bender," I'm back! Everyone at Kinko's was an idiot, so I just brought the original. 
",78,93,6,5,Farnsowrth,Zoidberg19329,Zoidberg," Jesus Christ! ...and his Twelve Apostles!
",43,93,6,5,Bender,Amy19330,Amy,"  That's odd. This hand here doesn't belong to anybody. And it's pointing a knife at James the Lesser!
",103,93,6,5,Zoidberg,Bender19331,Bender," That's the great thing about that hand.
",41,93,6,5,Amy,Hermes19332,Hermes,"  And what about these funky table legs? It's like their part of some other, funkier painting.
",95,93,6,5,Bender,Zoidberg19333,Zoidberg," Maybe da Vinci painted over something else. It's called a pentimento.
",71,93,6,5,Hermes,Farnsworth19334,Farnsworth," That's true, Dr. Zoidberg. How did you know that?
",51,93,6,5,Zoidberg,Zoidberg19335,Zoidberg," My doctorate is in Art History.
",33,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19336,Farnsworth," Let's see what's under the Last Supper. 
",42,93,6,5,Zoidberg,Hermes19337,Hermes," Wait a second, I'm not big-boned, I'm just fat.
",49,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19338,Farnsworth,"  My God! Look! 
",17,93,6,5,Hermes,Amy19339,Amy," My God! I'm looking!
",22,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Leela19340,Leela," My God! Saint James was a robot!
",34,93,6,5,Amy,Zoidberg19341,Zoidberg," My God! da Vinci left his legs unpainted as a clue.
",53,93,6,5,Leela,Farnsworth19342,Farnsworth," My God! This is the greatest mystery of all time. We must fly to Rome and exhume the body of Saint James.
",107,93,6,5,Zoidberg,Hermes19343,Hermes," Didn't we used to be a delivery company?
",42,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19344,Farnsworth," To the ship!
",14,93,6,5,Hermes,Fry19345,Fry," Psst. Leela, wanna join the Mile-Deep Club?
",45,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Leela19346,Leela," Sure, why not?
",16,93,6,5,Fry,Farnsworth19347,Farnsworth," No time! I've found a clue that could unlock all the secrets of history.  Look at these Roman numerals.
",105,93,6,5,Leela,Fry19348,Fry," Roman numerals? I've got it! We're in Rome.
",45,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19349,Farnsworth,"  Don't be stupid. It's a long lost mathematical code. I'll need to consult these ancient writings.  Some preposterous hog-wash about the Fibonacci Sequence. Aha! The markings indicate how many paces we need to take. One ... Okay, we're there. 
",245,93,6,5,Fry,Bender19350,Bender," Brothers and sisters, let us pry. 
",36,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19351,Farnsworth," It's true, Saint James really was a robot.
",44,93,6,5,Bender,Bender19352,Bender," I bet he's up in Robot Heaven right now. So he won't miss his eyes. 
",70,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Fry19353,Fry," My God! Robot Saint James is a zombie.
",40,93,6,5,Bender,Animatronio19354,Animatronio," Nay, I am not Saint James.
",28,93,6,5,Fry,Bender19355,Bender," Enough of your lies, Saint James. We saw you in the Last Supper.
",66,93,6,5,Animatronio,Animatronio19356,Animatronio," The great man Leonardo built me as an artist's model. When I took repose in this coffin, I carefully tossed the real Saint  James in yonder heap.  I'm sure you have many questions. Come, there is a chamber where I used to speak with Pope John the Patient.
",257,93,6,5,Bender,Animatronio19357,Animatronio,"  I told him I'd be back in five minutes. Ah well, he'll make a nice heap.  I am Animatronio, guardian of da Vinci's great secret. He left my legs visible in the painting as a clue, then dispatched me hither to wait for his shadow society of intellectuals.
",257,93,6,5,Animatronio,Fry19358,Fry," Hi, Animatronio.
",18,93,6,5,Animatronio,Farnsworth19359,Farnsworth," You personally knew da Vinci?  Was he nice? How did his hair smell? And on a personal note, what is the function of this device? 
",131,93,6,5,Fry,Animatronio19360,Animatronio," Halt! You do not know the function of the Macchina Magnifica? Then thou art not members of the Shadow Society. 
",113,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Bender19361,Bender," The what now?
",15,93,6,5,Animatronio,Animatronio19362,Animatronio," Not one more word shall I breathe. Not even about the great fountain where thou mayest find the... Wait. Thou didst not know about the fountain, didst thou? Curses, I must be punished. 
",187,93,6,5,Bender,Farnsworth19363,Farnsworth," Quick, we must find out what he knows before he flays himself to death!
",73,93,6,5,Animatronio,Leela19364,Leela," Where is the great fountain?
",30,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Fry19365,Fry," What makes it so great?
",25,93,6,5,Leela,Bender19366,Bender," Why does a robot need a codpiece?
",35,93,6,5,Fry,Animatronio19367,Animatronio," Fie, thou fen-suckled bum-bailey! Thou wilst never pry information from these mechanical lips!
",96,93,6,5,Bender,Leela19368,Leela," Just tell us, already!
",24,93,6,5,Animatronio,Animatronio19369,Animatronio," Okay, the fountain thou seekest is... 
",40,93,6,5,Leela,Farnsworth19370,Farnsworth," And so dies our hope of solving this mystery. Come on gang, let's go home. Wait! Let's not give up so easily. Animatronio mentioned a fountain.  That's a statue of Neptune, god of water. The number of points on him trident is three, or trey. The ""u"" in his name is written like ""v"". Trey, ""v"". Trevi! It's the Trevi Fountain. There can be no question!
",353,93,6,5,Animatronio,Leela19371,Leela," But, Professor...
",19,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19372,Farnsworth," There can be no question!
",27,93,6,5,Leela,Fry19373,Fry," Wow, it hasn't changed in a thousand years. 
",46,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19374,Farnsworth," Okay, everyone, into the fountain.
",36,93,6,5,Fry,Bender19375,Bender," What are you, senile? I'm not jumping in there.
",49,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Fry19376,Fry," Hey, look. Coins.
",19,93,6,5,Bender,Bender19377,Bender,"  I got 48 cents. There's one more nickel, and it's a big one! 
",64,93,6,5,Fry,Farnsworth19378,Farnsworth," Quickly, into the sewer hole. 
",32,93,6,5,Bender,Leela19379,Leela," Why? 
",7,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Fry19380,Fry,"  What's this dump? 
",21,93,6,5,Leela,Farnsworth19381,Farnsworth," My god! It's the Pantheon!
",28,93,6,5,Fry,Leela19382,Leela," This place is 3,000 years old. What could possibly be left to discover?
",73,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19383,Farnsworth," Maybe something about ourselves, Leela. Wait! What's under that blanket?  My God! da Vinci's Vitruvian Man!
",109,93,6,5,Leela,Fry19384,Fry," It's truly a masterpiece. Note how the perspective lines draw the eye right to his dong.
",90,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19385,Farnsworth,"  Say, what's this? 
",21,93,6,5,Fry,Bender19386,Bender," Anyone hear something?
",24,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19387,Farnsworth," It's a coin slot. Bender, insert that giant nickel.
",53,93,6,5,Bender,Bender19388,Bender," Sure.  Ow!
",12,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19389,Farnsworth," Hush, Bender.  What's your game, Vitruvian Man?  I withdraw the question, Vitruvian Man.
",90,93,6,5,Bender,Farnsworth19390,Farnsworth," Da Vinci's lost workshop!
",27,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Fry19391,Fry," At the risk of sounding stupid, do these things actually work?
",64,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19392,Farnsworth," Of course not, stupid!  I mean, that flying machine is as aerodynamic as a sofa. How could it possibly get off the ground?
",124,93,6,5,Fry,Animatronio19393,Animatronio," In a way that shalt never discover. .
",39,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Fry19394,Fry," Hi, Animatronio.
",18,93,6,5,Animatronio,Animatronio19395,Animatronio," I feign death and stalk thee, that I might preserve the greatest of Leonardo's secrets! 
",90,93,6,5,Fry,Bender19396,Bender," All right, buddy, we want secrets! And they better be ancient!
",64,93,6,5,Animatronio,Animatronio19397,Animatronio," Porco metallico! Never shall I reveal how these wonderous machines fit together!
",82,93,6,5,Bender,Farnsworth19398,Farnsworth," They fit together?
",20,93,6,5,Animatronio,Animatronio19399,Animatronio," I said no such thing. And then I died! 
",41,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Fry19400,Fry,"  You're right, Professor. This thing doesn't fly.
",51,93,6,5,Animatronio,Farnsworth19401,Farnsworth," Don't sit in there, you idiot! That's dangerous!  Wha?  No wonder this contraction isn't aerodynamic! It's not an aircraft, it's a spacecraft! 
",145,93,6,5,Fry,Animatronio19402,Animatronio," Basta! As I live, thou shan't discover the great secret! 
",59,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Fry19403,Fry," Bye, Animatronio!
",19,93,6,5,Animatronio,Farnsworth19404,Farnsworth," My God! Why would Leonardo's machine's brought us here?
",57,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19405,Fry," I don't know. Let's ask this guy. 
",36,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Leonardo da Vinci19406,Leonardo da Vinci," I am Leonardo.  Welcome to Planet Vinci.
",42,93,6,5,Fry,Farnsworth19407,Farnsworth," My God!
",9,93,6,5,Leonardo da Vinci,Fry19408,Fry," That's what I was gonna say!
",30,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19409,Farnsworth," Leonardo! You're alive? Here?
",31,93,6,5,Fry,Leonardo19410,Leonardo,"  You have learned my great secret. I was but a visitor to Earth. In truth, I am what you call a space alien.
",110,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19411,Farnsworth," Oh!
",5,93,6,5,Leonardo,Fry19412,Fry," It's an honor to meet you, Leonardo. And may I say you were great in Titanic. The Beach? Neh.
",95,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19413,Farnsworth," That's Leonardo DiCaprio, you blockhead! 
",43,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19414,Fry," Looks like eating rocks wasn't as dumb as you said.
",53,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Fry19415,Fry," So what do people do for fun here?
",36,93,6,5,Fry,Leonardo19416,Leonardo," Do you enjoy partying all night with plenty of ale and lusty women?
",69,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19417,Fry," I sure do!
",12,93,6,5,Leonardo,Leonardo19418,Leonardo," Not us. We spend our leisure time in the mathematics museum. Planet Vinci is basically a single colossal university.
",118,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19419,Fry," How your football team?
",25,93,6,5,Leonardo,Leonardo19420,Leonardo," Learned.
",10,93,6,5,Fry,Farnsworth19421,Farnsworth," Ooh! I'm going to check out that math lecture.  All this knowledge is giving me a raging brainer! 
",100,93,6,5,Leonardo,Leonardo19422,Leonardo," Would you like to hear the lecture, too, Fry?
",47,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Fry19423,Fry," No. It would just go in one ear and out some other hole.
",58,93,6,5,Leonardo,Leonardo19424,Leonardo," Come, sit down.
",17,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19425,Fry," Now that I can do.  I have a terrible secret to confess, Mr. DiCaprio. I'm not very smart.
",92,93,6,5,Leonardo,Leonardo19426,Leonardo," I appreciate your candor.
",27,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19427,Fry," I don't even know what language you're speaking.
",50,93,6,5,Leonardo,Leonardo19428,Leonardo," I, too, have a confession. You see, here on Planet Vinci, I am the stupidest person.
",86,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19429,Fry," What? Who possibly think you're stupid? 
",42,93,6,5,Leonardo,Biff19430,Biff," Duh, I'm Leonardo. I don't know the mass of the Higgs boson.
",62,93,6,5,Fry,Woman #119431,Woman #1," Duh, I have to draw in pencil, because I don't know how to use Rendering software.
",84,93,6,5,Biff,Leonardo19432,Leonardo," Stupid Biff. Thinks he's so smart.
",36,93,6,5,Woman #1,Fry19433,Fry," He looks stronger than you, too.
",34,93,6,5,Leonardo,Leonardo19434,Leonardo," I went to Earth because I could no longer stand the ridicule. But being surrounded by even stupider people was equally infuriating.
",133,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19435,Fry," I can see myself in your shiny button.
",40,93,6,5,Leonardo,Leonardo19436,Leonardo," Inventing is what makes me happy. Or did, until I misplaced the plans for my masterpiece.
",91,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19437,Fry," You mean these? 
",18,93,6,5,Leonardo,Leonardo19438,Leonardo," The Macchina Magnifica? Infinity joy! Fry, my friend, you have given my life a meaning again!
",95,93,6,5,Fry,Farnsworth19439,Farnsworth," That calculus lecture was harder than I expected. We had to answer every question in the form of an opera. I have a lot of homework for tomorrow, if I don't want to be  Embarrassed!
",183,93,6,5,Leonardo,Fry19440,Fry,"  Thank you. Thank you. And if you like that, you'll love our main event. Ladies and gentlemen, Leonardo DiCaprio!  I mean da Vinci! 
",134,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Leonardo19441,Leonardo," For centuries, you've all ridiculed me. Especially you, Biff.
",63,93,6,5,Fry,Biff19442,Biff," Nice hat! 
",12,93,6,5,Leonardo,Leonardo19443,Leonardo," But, at long last, this invention will show you. It will show you all. Behold, my unstoppable doomsday machine!
",113,93,6,5,Biff,Fry19444,Fry," And I helped! Wait. You told me it was an unstoppable ice cream machine.
",74,93,6,5,Leonardo,Leonardo19445,Leonardo," Ice cream is just a by-product of the machine. It's primary purpose is to exterminate everyone who ever made me feel inferior!
",128,93,6,5,Fry,Biff19446,Biff," Oh, I'm so scared!
",20,93,6,5,Leonardo,Girl19447,Girl," Bring it on, dum-dum. 
",24,93,6,5,Biff,Leonardo19448,Leonardo," Oh yeah? Let's see how hard you are laughing when my doomsday machine chops off your face! 
",93,93,6,5,Girl,Farnsworth19449,Farnsworth," Leonardo, stop!  I want in on this!
",37,93,6,5,Leonardo,Fry19450,Fry," Are you crazy, Professor?
",27,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19451,Farnsworth," I hate these nerds. Just because I'm stupider than them, they think they're smarter than me. Kill them all, starting with the math teacher!
",141,93,6,5,Fry,Farnsworth19452,Farnsworth,"  I knew this final invention would be a humdinger!
",52,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Leonardo19453,Leonardo," Yes, we three idiots will finally have our revenge.
",53,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Fry19454,Fry," I don't think so! You two make me ashamed to call myself an idiot.  There's always going to someone smarter than you, so the only way to be happy is to make the most of what you've got.
",187,93,6,5,Leonardo,Leonardo19455,Leonardo," But you've got nothing.
",25,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19456,Fry,"Oh no? I've got one single nail and another nail to nail it in with. And I'm gonna stop this infernal ice cream machine once and for all! 
",139,93,6,5,Leonardo,Biff19457,Biff," Some doomsday machine! It barely killed anyone!
",49,93,6,5,Fry,Leonardo19458,Leonardo," Oh, yeah? Well, take this! 
",29,93,6,5,Biff,Farnsworth19459,Farnsworth," Oh, my.
",9,93,6,5,Leonardo,Girl19460,Girl," Poor Leonardo da Vinci. He sure was stupid.
",45,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19461,Farnsworth," Fry, I admire what you did today, and I'm deeply sorry for insulting your intellect. Your tiny, tiny intellect. Oops, there I go again, you dope. I mean, dummy.
",162,93,6,5,Girl,Fry19462,Fry," It's okay. I may not be clever, but I have a good heart. That's what my mom used to say.
",90,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19463,Farnsworth," She was a wise woman.
",23,93,6,5,Fry,Fry19464,Fry," Also, that I'm not much to look at.
",37,93,6,5,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19465,Farnsworth," A wise woman, indeed.
",23,93,6,5,Fry,Farnsworth19466,Farnsworth,"  I fear I may not survive this war reenactment. I can't believe weâ€™re only twelve feet from the parking lot.
",110,94,6,6,Farnsworth,Fry19467,Fry,"  This is every bit as fun as the real Civil War.
",50,94,6,6,Farnsworth,Leela19468,Leela," Not the Civil War private. Weâ€™re reinacting the Sith-il War. 
",63,94,6,6,Fry,Fry19469,Fry," Sith? What the Hoth?
",22,94,6,6,Leela,Bender19470,Bender," Enemy invaders! Up in yonder sky!
",35,94,6,6,Fry,Darth Stroyer19471,Darth Stroyer," I am Darth Stroyer.
",21,94,6,6,Bender,Fry19472,Fry," Darth Stroyer? Thatâ€™s the stupidest name Iâ€™ve ever heard.
",59,94,6,6,Darth Stroyer,Leela19473,Leela," Letâ€™s hear the rest.
",22,94,6,6,Fry,Darth Trocious19474,Darth Trocious," Darth Trocious.
",17,94,6,6,Leela,Darth Sploder19475,Darth Sploder," Darth Sploder.
",16,94,6,6,Darth Trocious,Darth Urderer19476,Darth Urderer," Darth Urderer.
",16,94,6,6,Darth Sploder,Darth Ithead19477,Darth Ithead," Darth Ithead. 
",16,94,6,6,Darth Urderer,Leela19478,Leela," Company! Attack!
",18,94,6,6,Darth Ithead,Hermes19479,Hermes," Donâ€™t fire until you see the greens of their eyes! It saves on bullets.
",73,94,6,6,Leela,Darth Stroyer19480,Darth Stroyer," I shall rip out your heart and show it to you!  It is done.
",61,94,6,6,Hermes,Scruffy19481,Scruffy," The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long.  Mhrm.
",66,94,6,6,Darth Stroyer,Darth Sploder19482,Darth Sploder," You're dead!
",14,94,6,6,Scruffy,Farnsworth19483,Farnsworth," No, I'm just very old. 
",25,94,6,6,Darth Sploder,Darth Sploder19484,Darth Sploder,"  Woah! That's good acting!
",28,94,6,6,Farnsworth,Fry19485,Fry," It's payback time, Sploder! 
",30,94,6,6,Darth Sploder,Darth Sploder19486,Darth Sploder," Tell my mother... to pick me up outside Quiznos.
",50,94,6,6,Fry,Hermes19487,Hermes,"  That's three dead. Uh-oh. Let's pick up the pace, people. At this point in the actual war, the death toll was ninety-eight million. 
",135,94,6,6,Darth Sploder,Bender19488,Bender,"  You humans and your fragile organs. One little stab to the goo and 
",70,94,6,6,Hermes,Darth Trocious19489,Darth Trocious,"  You're dead, Earth man!
",26,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19490,Bender,"  Oh, cruel fate, I'm dead. They're putting me in my Sunday suit and shoving me in a wooden box.  Now they're loading me into cold, cold ground. Hello! Here come the worms! 
",174,94,6,6,Darth Trocious,Fry19491,Fry," If you were really dead, you wouldn't be laughing so hard.
",60,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19492,Bender," Yeah, yeah. Death's a big deal to you flesh bags. But in case you didn't notice, I'm a robot.
",95,94,6,6,Fry,Fry19493,Fry," So? What if something heavy fell on you, like a church? You could still die.
",78,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19494,Bender," Nuh-uh! My wireless back-up unit saves a copy of me every day. So, if my body gets killed, big whoop, I just download into another body. I'm immortal, baby!
",158,94,6,6,Fry,Amy19495,Amy," What? Then how come you always scream so much when you're in danger?
",70,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19496,Bender," I never said I wasn't a drama queen.
",38,94,6,6,Amy,Hermes19497,Hermes," And the winner of the war is... let me just cross check my tabulation here. Factor in the corsages for the widows.
",116,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19498,Bender," Hurry up, you number-crunching crumb-nuncher! Everybody but me is dying of old age!
",85,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19499,Hermes," Okay. The winners, at a net cost of only $12 per life cut tragically short, our Sith Overlords.
",97,94,6,6,Bender,Darth Sploder19500,Darth Sploder," Hot diggity! I mean...  Supreme diggity.
",42,94,6,6,Hermes,Fry19501,Fry," It may have been a fake war, but my scuffed knee is all too real.
",67,94,6,6,Darth Sploder,Farnsworth19502,Farnsworth," I have pain in joints I had removed a century ago. Bender, bring me my soft chair with the wheels on it.
",106,94,6,6,Fry,Bender19503,Bender," Your wheelchair?
",18,94,6,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19504,Farnsworth," I don't need a wheelchair! The one with the wheels!
",53,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19505,Bender," Poor flimsy humans. Don't you wish you were flawless like me? A towering inferno of physical perfection?
",106,94,6,6,Farnsworth,Leela19506,Leela," I hate to pop your blimp-like ego, but you're not perfect.
",60,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19507,Bender," Am so!
",8,94,6,6,Leela,Leela19508,Leela," Are not!
",10,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19509,Bender," Is too!
",9,94,6,6,Leela,Leela19510,Leela," Says who?
",11,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19511,Bender," Says the only human whose opinion I even remotely respect.  Inspector 5, the best inspector a kid could want. The day I was built, he looked me over, probably with tears of pride in his eyes, and proclaimed to all the world, by means of this scrap of paper, that I was perfect and infallible in every way!
",307,94,6,6,Leela,Farnsworth19512,Farnsworth," Hey, Mr. Perfect? You wet the chair. 
",39,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19513,Bender," Huh? Wasn't me. Must be some of that urine your all so proud of.
",66,94,6,6,Farnsworth,Fry19514,Fry,"  That's not urine, it's oil.
",30,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19515,Bender," Impossible! I'm triple sealed to prevent any chance of ... 
",61,94,6,6,Fry,Zoidberg19516,Zoidberg," You call that an ink defense?  Goodbye, friends!
",50,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19517,Bender," What could have caused the leak? Excessive heat, on the count that I'm so hot?
",80,94,6,6,Zoidberg,Farnsworth19518,Farnsworth," Alas, no. Oh, Bender, I'm afraid it's a symptom of a fatal defect.
",68,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19519,Bender," Yeah, fatal schmatal. If I die I can just download my backup copy into a new, equally fabulous, body.
",103,94,6,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19520,Farnsworth," That's just it! You can't. You were built without a backup unit.
",66,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19521,Bender,"  There's no backup copy of me?
",32,94,6,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19522,Farnsworth," That's what I just said, you mortal coil.
",43,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19523,Bender," So, if I die...
",17,94,6,6,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19524,Farnsworth," You die. Or as you put it 
",28,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19525,Bender,"  Um, excuse me for a moment.   No!
",36,94,6,6,Farnsworth,Bender19526,Bender," I can't believe it! I'm gonna die.
",36,94,6,6,Bender,Fry19527,Fry," How much time does he have left, Professor?
",45,94,6,6,Bender,Farnsworth19528,Farnsworth," Between a minute and a billion years.
",39,94,6,6,Fry,Fry19529,Fry,"  Well, at least you can plan accordingly.
",43,94,6,6,Farnsworth,Bender19530,Bender," Dying sucks butt! How do you living beings cope with mortality?
",65,94,6,6,Fry,Leela19531,Leela," Violent outbursts.
",20,94,6,6,Bender,Amy19532,Amy," General sluttiness.
",21,94,6,6,Leela,Fry19533,Fry," Thanks to denial, I'm immortal.
",33,94,6,6,Amy,Bender19534,Bender," Damn it, I'm supposed to be perfect. Inspector 5 gave me his blessing!  How could he bring me into this world knowing I gonna die?
",132,94,6,6,Fry,Zoidberg19535,Zoidberg," So you wish you were never born, maybe?
",41,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19536,Bender," Yes, anything less than immortality is a complete waste of time!
",66,94,6,6,Zoidberg,Zoidberg19537,Zoidberg," Then suicide it is. Step into my office. I'll give you a nice Kervorking.
",75,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19538,Bender," Not until I hunt down Inspector 5 and beat an explanation out of him!
",71,94,6,6,Zoidberg,Leela19539,Leela," I'm all for a good beating, but you'll never find him. Product inspectors are bureaucrats, faceless bean counters who blend into the woodwork.
",144,94,6,6,Bender,Hermes19540,Hermes,"  I beg to differ!
",19,94,6,6,Leela,Bender19541,Bender," Stinking bureaucrats! I hate 'em.
",35,94,6,6,Hermes,Leela19542,Leela," Then again, you might be able to find Inspector 5 with the help of another seasoned bureaucrat.
",97,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19543,Bender," Hermes, old pal!
",18,94,6,6,Leela,Hermes19544,Hermes," Old pal? 8.5 seconds ago, you said you hated me.
",50,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19545,Bender," Time heals all wounds.
",24,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19546,Hermes," You know what? I will help you, but only to prove I'm not just a paper-pushing file-jockey.
",93,94,6,6,Bender,Amy19547,Amy," Will you be taking your portable filing cabinet?
",50,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19548,Hermes," None of your beeswax!
",23,94,6,6,Amy,Hermes19549,Hermes," I'll only be away an hour, but I'm counting on you to do the all-critical filing in my absence. Shall we review alphabetical order.  A, B, C, D...
",148,94,6,6,Hermes,Leela19550,Leela,"  Get out of my office!
",24,94,6,6,Hermes,Old Man19551,Old Man," Yes. I'd like to request a death certificate. 
",48,94,6,6,Leela,Woman #119552,Woman #1," Sorry. That's Building C.
",27,94,6,6,Old Man,Hermes19553,Hermes," The Central Bureaucracy maintains records on all bureaucrats. We should be able to look up Inspector 5.
",105,94,6,6,Woman #1,Man #119554,Man #1,"  Application for ingress approved.  And the other potential entrant?
",70,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19555,Hermes," Uh, he's my pencil sharpener.
",31,94,6,6,Man #1,Bender19556,Bender," You betcha! 
",14,94,6,6,Hermes,Man #119557,Man #1,"  Proceed. 
",12,94,6,6,Bender,Hermes19558,Hermes," I maintain a cubicle here for weekend getaways.
",49,94,6,6,Man #1,Bender19559,Bender," Wow! Until now, I thought giant cubes were exciting.
",54,94,6,6,Hermes,Bender19560,Bender," I did like the part where they screamed.
",42,94,6,6,Bender,Hermes19561,Hermes,"  This is mine. Right next to the center square.
",49,94,6,6,Bender,Center Square Guy19562,Center Square Guy," Sorry, Hermes. I drank all your white-out. 
",45,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19563,Hermes," Once I log in, I can access Inspector 5's profile.
",52,94,6,6,Center Square Guy,Bender19564,Bender,"  Damn it! It won't go on.
",27,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19565,Hermes," That's because you're not me. 
",32,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19566,Bender," Hooray! It won't go on!
",25,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19567,Hermes," The bureaucra-scan won't let anyone but the assigned bureaucrat log in. 
",74,94,6,6,Bender,Computer19568,Computer," Identity confirmed. Also, you have a rectangular mass in your colon.
",70,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19569,Hermes," That's a calculator. I ate it to gain its power.
",50,94,6,6,Computer,Bender19570,Bender," You locate Inspector 5 while I slip into my ass-kicking feet. 
",64,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19571,Hermes,"  Sweet File-not-found of Puget Sound! His record's been blanked!
",66,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19572,Bender," Aw, man! How am I going to find some anonymous guy I don't know anything about?
",81,94,6,6,Hermes,Center Square Guy19573,Center Square Guy," I recommend the men's room of the TWA terminal. 
",50,94,6,6,Bender,Leela19574,Leela," Okay. Just filing alphabetically.  A, B, C, D...  Oh, this requires a little extra thought.  I'm a natural.
",109,94,6,6,Center Square Guy,Hermes19575,Hermes," The information we need will be here, in the physical files.
",62,94,6,6,Leela,Bender19576,Bender,"  Those bastards won't know what leafed through them.  It's on!
",64,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19577,Hermes,"  No! This is impossible! Quit blacking out and look at this. Inspectors 1, 2, 3, 4... 6. There's no trace of Inspector 5!
",123,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19578,Bender," But 5's the one we want. Maybe if I kicked the asses of Inspector 2 plus Inspector 3...
",89,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19579,Hermes," Addition never solve anything, man. Let's cut our losses and go home.
",71,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19580,Bender," So I'm doomed to die? And I'll never even get to punch whoever's responsible? Oh, what's the point. 
",102,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19581,Hermes," Bender, no! Suicide isn't necessarily the answer!
",51,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19582,Bender," It's not a suicide booth, you lard-ass. It's a phone booth. 
",62,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19583,Hermes," They have phones in booths now? Finally, I don't have to lug this cellphone around. 
",86,94,6,6,Bender,Mom19584,Mom," Who the hell is this? How did you get this number?
",52,94,6,6,Hermes,Bender19585,Bender," Is this the robot company? Cause I have a complaint about a defective robot. His name is me!
",94,94,6,6,Mom,Mom19586,Mom," A defective robot, you say?  Stay right there, dearie.  I'll have tech support take care of you. 
",99,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19587,Bender,"  Well, things are starting to look up.
",40,94,6,6,Mom,Hermes19588,Hermes," Look up!  Who did you call? Dial-a-bomb?
",42,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19589,Bender," No, I just told the robot company I was defective.
",52,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19590,Hermes," You dumb cocktail shaker! Mom won't allow a defective product to tarnish her good name! She'll kill you.
",106,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19591,Bender," Big whoop. I'll just download into a new... Oh, right. If I die, I die. Speaking of whichâ€“  You're right. You're right. You're right. 
",136,94,6,6,Hermes,Mom19592,Mom,"  That's what you get for calling tech support.
",48,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19593,Bender," I can't run anymore. I'll have to skip. 
",42,94,6,6,Mom,Hermes19594,Hermes," Just a few more feet. We have to get to that pile of dead bears by 7:38.
",74,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19595,Bender," A pile of dead bears can only mean one thing. But what?
",57,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19596,Hermes," It's the 7:38! Jump! 
",23,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19597,Bender," Aw, shoot!
",12,94,6,6,Hermes,Killbot #119598,Killbot #1," Someone said ""shoot!"" 
",24,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19599,Bender," Well, we're boned!
",20,94,6,6,Killbot #1,Hermes19600,Hermes," No, we're not! We just go to limbo!
",37,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19601,Bender," But I'm not design to bend that low, not without limbo music.  That'll do it. Ow! Ow! Ow!
",91,94,6,6,Hermes,Killbot #1 119602,Killbot #1 1," We're gonna get fired.
",24,94,6,6,Bender,Killbot #1 219603,Killbot #1 2," Someone said ""fire!"" 
",23,94,6,6,Killbot #1 1,Bender19604,Bender,"  We did it!
",13,94,6,6,Killbot #1 2,Hermes19605,Hermes," Twelve straight hours of limbo. I haven't done that since my honeymoon.
",73,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19606,Bender," Hermes! Hermes! Remember that flock of bats?
",46,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19607,Hermes," I sure do.
",12,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19608,Bender," That was fun.
",15,94,6,6,Hermes,Bender19609,Bender," Where are we?
",15,94,6,6,Bender,Hermes19610,Hermes," I have no idea.
",17,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19611,Bender," Hey. We're just a stone's throw from Tijuana.  See?
",53,94,6,6,Hermes,Mexican Man #119612,Mexican Man #1," Â¡Dios mÃ_o! A rock has fallen here in the outskirts of Tijuana.
",64,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19613,Bender," Is it within city limits?
",27,94,6,6,Mexican Man #1,Mexican Man #119614,Mexican Man #1," I think, yes.
",15,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19615,Bender," Told you!
",11,94,6,6,Mexican Man #1,Hermes19616,Hermes," Hey, you wanna celebrate our escape? Maybe grab a shot of tequila and take in a big-league cockfight?
",103,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19617,Bender," Sure. No, wait. I was built in Tijuana. Maybe Inspector 5 still works there. He better do some splaining. Before I mash up some face guacamole.
",145,94,6,6,Hermes,Bender19618,Bender,"  He's Mexican, I'm Mexican. Let me handle this.
",49,94,6,6,Bender,Mexican border patrolman19619,Mexican border patrolman," Sus papeles, por favor.
",25,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19620,Bender," Â¡SÃ_!  Ouch-o!
",15,94,6,6,Mexican border patrolman,Hermes19621,Hermes,"  Here are our passports, visas, and Homeland Security permission slips, notarized and starched.
",97,94,6,6,Bender,Mexican border patrolman19622,Mexican border patrolman,"  Okay. I also would Â¡ave accepted a bribe.
",44,94,6,6,Hermes,Bender19623,Bender," Nice work, butterball. You know, I was in Italy last week. 
",61,94,6,6,Mexican border patrolman,Bender19624,Bender," My birthplace. It's closed! There's not even a shrine to me. With a gift shop, selling piÃ±atas of me!
",103,94,6,6,Bender,Hermes19625,Hermes," End of the line, man! Come on, we can still catch a twi-night double cockfight.
",81,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19626,Bender," No wait! What's that in the Mexican garbage?
",46,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19627,Hermes," Looks like a half-eaten cheese diaper.
",40,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19628,Bender," No, next to that.  A half-eaten employee directory.  Inspector 5's home address.  His ass-ias is gracias!
",107,94,6,6,Hermes,Bender19629,Bender,"  Where are you hiding, you coward? Get out here and get murdered like a man!
",78,94,6,6,Bender,Hermes19630,Hermes,"  Bender, I'm afraid our search is at an end. He's obviously long gone.
",72,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19631,Bender," Oh yeah? Well, maybe this is him in a costume.  I'm gonna squeeze you out of there like Tijuana toothpaste.
",109,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19632,Hermes,"  Okay, Bender, you're mortal. And okay, Inspector 5 screwed up. But that just makes the time you have left all the more precious. Do you really want to waste the rest of your life in a bitter, homicidal rage?
",210,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19633,Bender,"  No! Yes! I don't know!  Why? Why did he do this to me? All I wanted was a little quality control. But he didn't care enough. And now I gonna die. I deserve better! I'm Bender, damn it! I'm Bender! 
",200,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19634,Hermes," There, there, mon. It's gonna be okay. You are Bender, which is something Inspector 5 will never be.
",102,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19635,Bender," You know what? You're right. He was just a stupid bureaucrat. A stupid paper-pushing bureaucrat. A stupid I-dotting, chair squashing,  Oh. No offense, Hermes. You're not like that. I mean, you're exactly like that, but you're okay! In fact, I'm putting you on the do-no-kill list.  Come on, fellow mortal. We're in Tijuana. I wanna live a little.  Help, I'm gonna die! That's the opposite of what I want!
",406,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19636,Hermes,"  Quick, run out the back! I'll hack into Inspector 5's terminal and fake your death, so they'll call off the Killbots.
",120,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19637,Bender," You know that terminal's unhackable! I'm not leaving you, and that's final!  Good luck, buddy!
",96,94,6,6,Hermes,Computer19638,Computer," Bender, terminated.
",21,94,6,6,Bender,Hermes19639,Hermes," Bender saved.
",15,94,6,6,Computer,Killbot #1 219640,Killbot #1 2," Cease fire. Mom called off the attack, although I don't see how it's herâ€“
",75,94,6,6,Hermes,Killbot #1 319641,Killbot #1 3," Someone said ""howitzer!"" 
",27,94,6,6,Killbot #1 2,Bender19642,Bender," Yeah! All right! Yeah!  He did it! And he's not even looking back at that cool explosion! He's a hero!
",104,94,6,6,Killbot #1 3,Amy19643,Amy," What's happening? The phone's been disconnected, the ship's been repossessed, and Zoidberg's getting overcooked! 
",115,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19644,Bender,"  Ah. This place never changes.
",32,94,6,6,Amy,Hermes19645,Hermes," Leela! What in the name of Jah happened?
",42,94,6,6,Bender,Leela19646,Leela," Too much papers! Not enough hiding plants!
",44,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19647,Hermes," It's alright. This place just needs a one-hour bureaucratizing.
",65,94,6,6,Leela,Leela19648,Leela,"  You make it look so easy.
",28,94,6,6,Hermes,Hermes19649,Hermes," I've smoked a lot of paperwork in my day.
",43,94,6,6,Leela,Fry19650,Fry," Hey, Bender. Did you ever find that inspector guy you were looking for?
",73,94,6,6,Hermes,Bender19651,Bender,"  Nah, but thanks to this knucklehead, I did find a new outlook on life. It's precious and sacred, and you only get so many millions of years on this Earth. So let's get brick-faced! 
",184,94,6,6,Fry,Hermes19652,Hermes," 
",2,94,6,6,Bender,Bender19653,Bender," Don't wake up Fry.
",20,95,6,7,Hermes,Bender19654,Bender," My roommate's sleeping.
",25,95,6,7,Bender,Bender19655,Bender," Wake up already!  I'm about to get down and funky with this ladybot. And I'd appreciate it if as many people as possible could know about it.   Now can we get some privacy?
",174,95,6,7,Bender,Bender19656,Bender," Ah yeah, backing on up.
",25,95,6,7,Bender,Bender19657,Bender,"  Hambone! Hambone! Hambone.  Okay, hambone break's over. Back to the bedroom.
",79,95,6,7,Bender,Bender19658,Bender,"  Hambone! Hambone! Hambone.
",29,95,6,7,Bender,Bender19659,Bender," Wake up and feel the coffee.
",30,95,6,7,Bender,Fry19660,Fry," Oh no! I'm late for work again!
",33,95,6,7,Bender,Fry19661,Fry," Sorry, I'm late.
",18,95,6,7,Fry,Bender19662,Bender," Well, well, well. Look who decided to show up.
",48,95,6,7,Fry,Farnsworth19663,Farnsworth," I've had it with your tardiness, Fry. I expect you to arrive the same time as everyone else.
",94,95,6,7,Bender,Fry19664,Fry," Well, wait a second. Leela's not here yet.
",44,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Amy19665,Amy," She left a while ago. She said some idiot were taking her to lunch for her birthday.
",86,95,6,7,Fry,Fry19666,Fry," Oh no! I'm late.
",18,95,6,7,Amy,Elzar19667,Elzar," Since you got stood up, I thought this might cheer you up a notch.
",68,95,6,7,Fry,Leela19668,Leela," That's not necessary.
",23,95,6,7,Elzar,Elzar19669,Elzar,"  What day is today?
It's Leela's birthday
",43,95,6,7,Leela,Leela19670,Leela," Please stop.
",14,95,6,7,Elzar,Elzar19671,Elzar,"  What a day for a birthday
",28,95,6,7,Leela,Leela19672,Leela," I really would like you to stop singing.
",42,95,6,7,Elzar,Elzar19673,Elzar,"  Let's all have some cake.  You want to buy a slice of a birthday cake for 11.95?
",83,95,6,7,Leela,Leela19674,Leela," Yes, please.
",14,95,6,7,Elzar,Fry19675,Fry," Ooh, nice cake. Sorry, I'm late.
",34,95,6,7,Leela,Leela19676,Leela,"  Where have youâ€”?  Nah, it's fine.
",36,95,6,7,Fry,Fry19677,Fry," You're not mad?
",17,95,6,7,Leela,Leela19678,Leela," I was. But then I realised it's actually my fault for thinking you might be on time for once.  Anyhow, I ate both our lunches. You ordered the Lobster PilÃ©. It wasn't cheap.
",175,95,6,7,Fry,Elzar19679,Elzar," Bam!
",6,95,6,7,Leela,Fry19680,Fry," Please, let me make it up to you. I'll treat you to a fancy birthday dinner tonight at Cavern on the Green.
",109,95,6,7,Elzar,Leela19681,Leela," Wow. That'll be the nicest place I've ever been stood up.
",59,95,6,7,Fry,Fry19682,Fry," Not this time. No matter what happens, I'll swear I be there.
",63,95,6,7,Leela,Bender19683,Bender," Guys, guys! Hedonism bot is finally settling down and marrying a nice house in the suburb.  But tonight, he's having the girls gone wildest bachelor party of all time.
",169,95,6,7,Fry,Fry19684,Fry," Woohoohoohoo...  ... cares? I'm having dinner with Leela.
",59,95,6,7,Bender,Leela19685,Leela," Just go to your stupid party. We can have dinner on my birthday some other year.
",82,95,6,7,Fry,Fry19686,Fry," No. I can throw up on a stripper anytime. Tonight, I wanna not throw up. On you.
",82,95,6,7,Leela,Leela19687,Leela," Really?
",9,95,6,7,Fry,Bender19688,Bender," Your loss.  Hey, Professor, you're my wingman.
",48,95,6,7,Leela,Farnsworth19689,Farnsworth," Very well. Eh, Cubert, fetch my drinking teeth.
",49,95,6,7,Bender,Fry19690,Fry," I just have to sign Leela's birthday card. How do you spell XO?
",65,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Amy19691,Amy," Guh. It's a record-your-own-message card. You don't sign it. You leave a nude video greeting.
",95,95,6,7,Fry,Fry19692,Fry," Does it have to be nude?
",26,95,6,7,Amy,Amy19693,Amy," I guess not. That never occurred to me.
",41,95,6,7,Fry,Fry19694,Fry," If I leave now, record a birthday greeting on the way, score some fancy cologne at the newsstand, I'll be exactly on time!
",124,95,6,7,Amy,Farnsworth19695,Farnsworth," You're not going anywhere.
",28,95,6,7,Fry,Fry19696,Fry," But I have a date.
",20,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19697,Farnsworth," You were late this morning. So you'll have to stay and test my latest invention.  Behold! A time travelling machine!
",118,95,6,7,Fry,Bender19698,Bender," Time? I can't go back there.
",30,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19699,Farnsworth," Ah, but this time machine only goes forward in time. That way you can't accidentally change history. Or do something disgusting like sleep with your own grandmother.
",167,95,6,7,Bender,Fry19700,Fry," I wouldn't wanna do that again.
",33,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19701,Farnsworth," We're going to test it by going forward in time one minute.  Get in.
",70,95,6,7,Fry,Fry19702,Fry," Okay, hurry. Let's get it over with. I can record Leela's birthday card while we're in there.
",95,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Fry19703,Fry,"  Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, 'cause we're testing the professor's dumb time machine.
",128,95,6,7,Fry,Farnsworth19704,Farnsworth," Okay. I'll just nudge us forward exactly one minute into theâ€”
",63,95,6,7,Fry,Fry19705,Fry," My card!
",10,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Fry19706,Fry," Did we go too far? What time is it?
",37,95,6,7,Fry,Bender19707,Bender,"  The year ten thousand!
",25,95,6,7,Fry,Farnsworth19708,Farnsworth,"  Whoopsie.
",12,95,6,7,Bender,Farnsworth19709,Farnsworth," Oh dear. I mean, oh my.
",25,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Fry19710,Fry," The year ten thousand? But I promised Leela I'll be on time for dinner.
",73,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19711,Farnsworth," Relax, Fry. Everyone we ever knew died thousands of years ago.
",64,95,6,7,Fry,Bender19712,Bender," Everyone we ever knew? Nah, I never liked those guys.
",55,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Fry19713,Fry,"  No! They did it! They blew it up!  And then the apes blew up their society too. How could this happen?  And then the birds took over and ruined their society.  And then the cows. And then...  ... I don't know, is that a slug, maybe?  Noooo!
",243,95,6,7,Bender,Waiter19714,Waiter," While you await your  friend. Allow me to read from a prepared history of our cavern.  These unique rock formations were created over millions of years by mineral rich water dripping from pores in the ceiling. Dripping and dripping.  year on year,  century after century.
",273,95,6,7,Fry,Elzar19715,Elzar,"  What day is today?  Hey, aren't you the loser who got stood up on my other restaurant?
",89,95,6,7,Waiter,Leela19716,Leela," Just shut up and bring me two dinners.
",40,95,6,7,Elzar,Leela19717,Leela," Has anyone seen Fry's ass? It's late for a date with my boot.
",63,95,6,7,Leela,Cubert19718,Cubert," Fry's not here. Obviously he went to that pervert party with Bender and the professor.
",88,95,6,7,Leela,Leela19719,Leela," Fry went to the party?
",24,95,6,7,Cubert,Linda19720,Linda,"  We interrupt Hypnotoad on Ice to bring you breaking coverage ...  ... of the disaster at Hedonism bot's bachelor party.
",122,95,6,7,Leela,Morbo19721,Morbo,"  Linda, what began as innocent fun ended in tragedy tonight when a nuclear powered robot stripper suffered a catastrophic reactor meltdown. There is only one survivor.
",169,95,6,7,Linda,Hedonism Bot19722,Hedonism Bot," Everywhere I looked there were piles of bodies. And then the explosion struck.
",80,95,6,7,Morbo,Zoidberg19723,Zoidberg," The three coworkers I liked... all dead!
",42,95,6,7,Hedonism Bot,Leela19724,Leela," Fry stood me up and died?  I'm so angry.  I mean, I'm so sad.  But I'm still pretty angry.  But also sad.  Can I be both?
",123,95,6,7,Zoidberg,Hermes19725,Hermes," It's what he'd want.
",22,95,6,7,Leela,Leela19726,Leela," Then that's what I am! Hi-yah!
",32,95,6,7,Hermes,Bender19727,Bender," Man, the future is a total craphole. Whoever lives here is a crapface sack of crap.  No offence, fellows.
",107,95,6,7,Leela,Native #119728,Native #1," Don't sweat it, man.
",22,95,6,7,Bender,Fry19729,Fry," I'll never see Leela again.
",29,95,6,7,Native #1,Farnsworth19730,Farnsworth," No, without a backwards time machine we're stuck in this craphole.
",68,95,6,7,Fry,Native #119731,Native #1," Dude, give it a rest.
",23,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19732,Farnsworth," Hold on! I got it. We can't go back in time, but we can keep going forward until people invent the backwards time machine.
",124,95,6,7,Native #1,Fry19733,Fry," And then we can go home.
",26,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Bender19734,Bender," Hit it.
",9,95,6,7,Fry,Song19735,Song,"  In the year one-o-five, one-o-five
If man is still alive
If robot can survive
They may find
 In the year twenty-five twenty-five twenty-five
The backwards time machine still won't have arrived
In all the world, there's only one technology
A rusty sword for practicing proctology
 In the future year that ends with a twenty
A slumpy merman is gonna try to get chummy
He may look like a watery wimp
When in fact he's a blood thirsty schrimp
 In the year one million and a half
Human kind is enslaved by giraffe
Men must pay for all his misdeeds
When the tree tops are stripped off their leaves
Woah-wow
",603,95,6,7,Bender,Old Hermes19736,Old Hermes," Sometimes I can't believe how successful Planet Express became once the professor was killed and you seized control.
",118,95,6,7,Song,Old Leela19737,Old Leela," There were tough times. But we all pulled together.
",53,95,6,7,Old Hermes,Old Zoidberg19738,Old Zoidberg," I've been crunching the numbers on our transgalactic strategyâ€”
",64,95,6,7,Old Leela,Old Leela19739,Old Leela," What are you doing here? I laid you off twenty years ago.

",45,95,6,7,Old Leela,Old Leela19741,Old Leela," Success is nice, but I do kinda miss the old days.

",32,95,6,7,Old Leela,Bender19745,Bender," We are travellers from the past, my good runt.
",48,95,6,7,Male inhabitant,Female inhabitant19746,Female inhabitant," I see, since your time, human evolution has diverged.
",55,95,6,7,Bender,Male inhabitant19747,Male inhabitant," There are we; advanced in intellect and morality.
",51,95,6,7,Female inhabitant,Female inhabitant19748,Female inhabitant," And the Dumblocks; stupid vicious brutes, who live underground.
",65,95,6,7,Male inhabitant,Farnsworth19749,Farnsworth," Advanced in intellect, you say? Have you invented a backwards time machine?
",77,95,6,7,Female inhabitant,Female inhabitant19750,Female inhabitant," No, but if we apply our superior minds, we can perfect such a device within five years.
",89,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19751,Farnsworth," See you then!
",15,95,6,7,Female inhabitant,Bender19752,Bender," We're back for our time machine.
",34,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19753,Farnsworth," Yuhoo, boys! What's this era in human history like?
",53,95,6,7,Bender,Soldier #1 #119754,Soldier #1 #1," The... the machines, we built them to make our lives easier, but they rebelled. They won't stop until every human is dead.
",124,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Bender19755,Bender," This seems like a nice future. Let's just stay here. We can settle down on that mountain of skulls.
",101,95,6,7,Soldier #1 #1,Bender19756,Bender," Hey! That place had a gorgeous view of Blood Lake.
",52,95,6,7,Bender,Lady #119757,Lady #1," Greetings, time travellers.
",29,95,6,7,Bender,Bender19758,Bender," Stupid jerks wouldn't let me stay in the good future.

",40,95,6,7,Bender,Lady #219760,Lady #2," We too studied the time travel enigma.
",40,95,6,7,Fry,Lady #319761,Lady #3," We have perfected a method using negative mass neutrino fields that allow us to travel backwards in time.
",107,95,6,7,Lady #2,Farnsworth19762,Farnsworth," My name's Hubert.
",19,95,6,7,Lady #3,Fry19763,Fry,"  All right! We can go home!

",24,95,6,7,Fry,Lady #119765,Lady #1," We can talk about our research tomorrow. Men are very rare in our society. Even very old and stupid males are priced.  Tonight, please be the guests of honour at our fertility banquet.
",186,95,6,7,Bender,Farnsworth19766,Farnsworth," Well, there is certainly no harm in a fertility banquet.
",58,95,6,7,Lady #1,Fry19767,Fry," I can eat. And fertilise.
",27,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Lady #119768,Lady #1," Very well, let us anoint our guests in oil without using our hands.
",69,95,6,7,Fry,Bender19769,Bender,"  Oh, so we can stay in the future you like? But not the future I like? Next!
",78,95,6,7,Lady #1,Farnsworth19770,Farnsworth," No! I was about to close the deal.
",36,95,6,7,Bender,Fry19771,Fry," Bender, they had a backwards time machine.
",44,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Bender19772,Bender," The other place had a lot of good things too. Did you even see that mountain of skulls?
",89,95,6,7,Fry,Farnsworth19773,Farnsworth," Why you!
",10,95,6,7,Bender,Bender19774,Bender," Oh no, you didn't.
",20,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Fry19775,Fry," Stop. Somewhere, some time, Leela's waiting for me. We need to keep looking for a backwards time machine.
",107,95,6,7,Bender,Farnsworth19776,Farnsworth," Fry is right.
",15,95,6,7,Fry,Bender19777,Bender," Yes, we have to work together. Not have this fight which I was definitely winning.
",84,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19778,Farnsworth," The year one billion.
",23,95,6,7,Bender,Farnsworth19779,Farnsworth," I got a feeling this could be exactly the point in time we've been looking for.  Nope.  In fact, all life is extinct.
",119,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Fry19780,Fry," So let's keeping going forward.
",33,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19781,Farnsworth," Oh, it's no use. Earth is dead. This is the end of all things.
",64,95,6,7,Fry,Fry19782,Fry," The Cavern on the Green.
",26,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Fry19783,Fry," I made it, Leela. Sorry, I'm a billion years late.
",52,95,6,7,Fry,Old Leela19784,Old Leela," You'll get your alimony cheque, Cubert. Now get lost.

",55,95,6,7,Old Amy,Old Leela19788,Old Leela," I don't know either. I'm married to the job now.  I used to think there was someone for me, butâ€”  Aw!  How odd, it's one of those old record-your-own-message birthday cards.
",175,95,6,7,Old Hermes,Fry19789,Fry,"  Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, because we are testing the professor's dumb time machine. But you know, happy birthday and all and...  ... I love you.  My card!
",201,95,6,7,Old Leela,Old Leela19790,Old Leela," My whole life I've been mad at him. And it wasn't his fault.
",62,95,6,7,Fry,Leela19791,Leela,"  Dear Fry, our time together was short, but it was the best time of my life.
",78,95,6,7,Old Leela,Fry19792,Fry," You know, all in all, I had a good life. What you say the three of us grab a six pack and watch the universe end?

",13,95,6,7,Fry,Bender19794,Bender," That's basically what I do every day.

",47,95,6,7,Fry,Farnsworth19798,Farnsworth," Who knows? Probably some hogwash about the human spirit.
",58,95,6,7,Fry,Bender19799,Bender," Mm-hm.

",12,95,6,7,Fry,Fry19808,Fry," Did anyone else see that?
",27,95,6,7,Bender,Farnsworth19809,Farnsworth," Unbelievable. It's a second big bang.  My God, is it possible?
",64,95,6,7,Fry,Fry19810,Fry," It must be possible. It's happening. By the way, what's happening?
",68,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19811,Farnsworth," It appears, this universe is exactly identical to the old one. If so, we just need to keep going forward in time to the point when we left.  The Earth is born!  Ladies and gentlemen, the moon.
",194,95,6,7,Fry,Fry19812,Fry," Look. The first fish to crawl up on land.
",43,95,6,7,Farnsworth,Bender19813,Bender,"  It was coming right at us.

",87,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19854,Amy," What?
",7,96,6,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19855,Farnsworth," I probably should have told you. Anyway, the important thing is to be relaxed tomorrow.
",89,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19856,Amy," Are you sure?
",15,96,6,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19857,Farnsworth," Yes. Do what you young people do to unwind. Take a joyride in your jalopy. Wear a T-shirt and eat a fish stick. Go!
",117,96,6,8,Amy,Kif19858,Kif," Okay, amigos, one teensy drink to help Amy relax.

",41,96,6,8,Leela,Leela19865,Leela," A talk? You can't break up with me. You're my pet!
",52,96,6,8,Nibbler,Nibbler19866,Nibbler," As much as I enjoy being the object of your misplaced affections, I am also a highly sophisticated being who longs for intelligent conversation.

",44,96,6,8,Nibbler,Nibbler19868,Nibbler," An understatement, to say the least. It's time you treated me with respect.
",77,96,6,8,Leela,Leela19869,Leela," If you want to be treated like a fellow crew member, fine, but no more purse rides, and no more dressing you up in your cute little sailor suit.

",31,96,6,8,Hedonism Bot,Alarm Clock19875,Alarm Clock," Sorry, I hooked up with Bender last night. Dude was all over my snooze button.
",80,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19876,Amy," But my doctoral exam is in ten minutes! On Mars!  Eww! Kif, did you yack on the floor?
",88,96,6,8,Alarm Clock,Kif19877,Kif,"  Yes, I did.
",14,96,6,8,Amy,Katz19878,Katz," Where's your candidate, Farnsworth? I have a long list of students to humiliate today.  You're late, Miss Wong.
",113,96,6,8,Kif,Amy19879,Amy," Oh, God, this is like one of those nightmares. 
",49,96,6,8,Katz,Farnsworth19880,Farnsworth," Here, take my lab coat. 
",26,96,6,8,Amy,Katz19881,Katz," Allow me to introduce your examining committee in descending  order of grumpiness. Professor Ogden Wernstrom.
",111,96,6,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19882,Farnsworth," Wernstrom!
",12,96,6,8,Katz,Katz19883,Katz," Downtown Professor of Applied Physics, Ethan 'Bubblegum' Tate.
",64,96,6,8,Farnsworth,Tate19884,Tate," I see by your curriculum vitÃ_ that you're a Sagittarius.

",22,96,6,8,Katz,Farnsworth19887,Farnsworth,"  He proved that 50 years ago, and he's been coasting on it ever since.
",72,96,6,8,Shpeekenshpell,Katz19888,Katz," I am the esteemed Professor Morris Katz, and you are wasting my time. Proceed.
",80,96,6,8,Farnsworth,Amy19889,Amy," Imagine, if you will...
",25,96,6,8,Katz,Katz19890,Katz," Oh, God!
",10,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19891,Amy," A gigantic spherical generator, one that could provide unlimited energy, because it's essentially in Perpetual Motion.
",120,96,6,8,Katz,Wernstrom19892,Wernstrom,"  Young lady, have you been drinking?
",38,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19893,Amy," Well, yes, but that's not revelant. I'm talking about Earth. Earth's the generator.  Suppose this basketball is the whole world.
",130,96,6,8,Wernstrom,Tate19894,Tate,"  To many young men in the inner city, it is.
",46,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19895,Amy," As it spins, it's producing an enormous magnetic field. If we could use that field to generate electric current, we could actually harness the Earth's rotational ener... Ener... 
",180,96,6,8,Tate,Farnsworth19896,Farnsworth," Yes, tapping the Earth's ener-kerchoo. Go on.
",47,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19897,Amy," Sorry, I'm super-allergic to cats. Professor Katz, would you mind.
",68,96,6,8,Farnsworth,Katz19898,Katz," Miss Wong, I mind everything.
",31,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19899,Amy,"  You just need to polarize the Earth's core with a huge static charge,  by ratcheting Superconducting wire down into...  Sorry.
",129,96,6,8,Katz,Katz19900,Katz," Enough. The committee members will now vote yea or nay. Nay.
",62,96,6,8,Amy,Wernstrom19901,Wernstrom," Nay.
",6,96,6,8,Katz,Tate19902,Tate," Hell nay.
",11,96,6,8,Wernstrom,Shpeekenshpell19903,Shpeekenshpell,"  The horse says, doctorate denied.
",36,96,6,8,Tate,Fry19904,Fry," It's okay, Amy. I don't have a fancy degree either, but today I'm a prominent boy in the package delivery field. 
",115,96,6,8,Shpeekenshpell,Nibbler19905,Nibbler," Now that I'm a full and equal member of the crew, I pledge my loyalty, my perspicacity, and, dare I say it, my friendship.
",124,96,6,8,Fry,Hermes19906,Hermes," Leela, muzzle that skunk! We can't stop a meeting for some cute, fuzzy, little...  Hey, look, a kitty cat.
",108,96,6,8,Nibbler,Amy19907,Amy,"  You again?  Get away you mangy ball of Histamines.
",53,96,6,8,Hermes,Hermes19908,Hermes,"  You leave kitty cat alone! 
",30,96,6,8,Amy,Farnsworth19909,Farnsworth," People, please, I'm trying to run a business, so I get to hold kitty. 
",72,96,6,8,Hermes,Fry19910,Fry," Over here. I wanna hold him.
",30,96,6,8,Farnsworth,Bender19911,Bender," Aw! Its anus looks like an asterisk.
",38,96,6,8,Fry,Leela19912,Leela," Captain Fuzzytoes reporting for duty. I mean, cutie. 
",55,96,6,8,Bender,Nibbler19913,Nibbler,"  My best friend died in that uniform. I hate that cat!
",56,96,6,8,Leela,Amy19914,Amy," If I had a spray bottle, I'd give him such a spritzing.
",57,96,6,8,Nibbler,Nibbler19915,Nibbler," I'll tell you one thing. Nothing acts that cute without some ulterior motive. 
",80,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19916,Amy," Aw! You want your diapey changed? 
",36,96,6,8,Nibbler,Nibbler19917,Nibbler,"  We'll have to watch its every move.  Powder, please.
",55,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19918,Amy," Here's my new theory. That is one adorable cat.
",49,96,6,8,Nibbler,Nibbler19919,Nibbler," I guess I was just jealous. I do miss being Leela's schnookums. I'm going to apologize and hope for a pity pet. 
",114,96,6,8,Amy,Leela19920,Leela,"  Yes, my lord. Amy and Nibbler are a tewwible thweat. They must be spayed and neutered, wespectivewy. 
",104,96,6,8,Nibbler,Amy19921,Amy,"  The cat is evil! We have proof!
",34,96,6,8,Leela,Nibbler19922,Nibbler," It was summoning a saucer!
",28,96,6,8,Amy,Farnsworth19923,Farnsworth," Of course it wanted a saucer, you idiot. A saucer of dewicious cweam. 
",72,96,6,8,Nibbler,Nibbler19924,Nibbler," You fool, this isn't about the cream.
",39,96,6,8,Farnsworth,Bender19925,Bender," It's pwonounced ""cweam"". 
",27,96,6,8,Nibbler,Zoidberg19926,Zoidberg," I'm petting mine down to the bone. 
",37,96,6,8,Bender,Fry19927,Fry," Just stwoke its fwffy fur.
",28,96,6,8,Zoidberg,Hermes19928,Hermes," Scwatch its fwubby chin.
",26,96,6,8,Fry,Bender19929,Bender," Fweeble its fwooby pwow.
",26,96,6,8,Hermes,Amy19930,Amy," No, no! 
",10,96,6,8,Bender,Nibbler19931,Nibbler," What do cats need with that much yarn and cobalt?
",51,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19932,Amy," They're doing something downstairs. We've got to find out what. 
",66,96,6,8,Nibbler,Bender19933,Bender," Where do you think you're going, no-cat?
",42,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19934,Amy," Uh, the basement. I think I left the air hockey table on.
",59,96,6,8,Bender,Bender19935,Bender," Without a cat, you ain't going nowhere. 
",42,96,6,8,Amy,Nibbler19936,Nibbler," Can you at least tell us what's going on down there?
",54,96,6,8,Bender,Farnsworth19937,Farnsworth," We're certainly not building something sinister, if that's what your implying. Now, come on, Bender. Something sinister won't build itself. 
",142,96,6,8,Nibbler,Amy19938,Amy," Professor Katz's last name is Katz. Do you think he has something to do with these cats?
",90,96,6,8,Farnsworth,Nibbler19939,Nibbler," The conclusion is an inescapable as it is moronic.  I say we pay him a visit, and if he won't talk to us, he'll talk to Smith & Wesson,  or, perhaps, Consolidated Head Melter. 
",178,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19940,Amy,"  Professor Katz, we want answers! 
",36,96,6,8,Nibbler,Nibbler19941,Nibbler," I warn you, if I have to get cute, it's gonna get ugly. 
",58,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19942,Amy," He's dead!
",12,96,6,8,Nibbler,Nibbler19943,Nibbler," Wait. What are these strings on his lap?  What the... He isn't dead. He's one of those dog-operated puppets that's been adapted for use by a cat!
",147,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19944,Amy," So I had my doctorate denied by that fuzzball?  Bad kitty!
",60,96,6,8,Nibbler,Amy19945,Amy," They actually built the planetary ratchet from my thesis!  Uh-oh.
",67,96,6,8,Amy,Nibbler19946,Nibbler," What the... 
",14,96,6,8,Amy,Thubanian Leader19947,Thubanian Leader," Well, look what the me dragged in.
",36,96,6,8,Nibbler,Nibbler19948,Nibbler," You can talk!
",15,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Thubanian Leader19949,Thubanian Leader," You can talk?
",15,96,6,8,Nibbler,Nibbler19950,Nibbler," How ironic. Two hyper-intelligent beings both pretending to be simple house pets!
",83,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Thubanian Leader19951,Thubanian Leader," Say, do you know Obliteron? He pretends to be a hamster, but...
",65,96,6,8,Nibbler,Amy19952,Amy," Yeah, that's really great. Could you please tell us what's going on?
",70,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Thubanian Leader19953,Thubanian Leader," What? Oh, right! You see, my associates and I are from the ninth planet of the star you call Thuban. Long ago, life there was ideal.  Our sun provided plenty of warm, dozy light. The chicken-salmon roamed free.  Yet disaster loomed. Our planet's rotation was gradually slowing.  At first, it seemed beneficial. Long, dark nights for sleeping, long, sunny days for sleeping. But then it got too hot and too cold.  Our top scientists went to work,  At last, they located a planet with the necessary orientation and magnetic field to harness the rotational energy. 
",564,96,6,8,Amy,Nibbler19954,Nibbler," Earth!
",8,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Thubanian Leader19955,Thubanian Leader," Indubitably. Although we call it Blue Blue Shiny Ball.  In the area now known as Egypt, my people constructed a giant, semi-octahedral antenna to beam Earth's rotational energy to Thuban. 
",190,96,6,8,Nibbler,Amy19956,Amy," The Great Pyramid at Giza!
",28,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Thubanian Leader19957,Thubanian Leader," Yes. The Egyptians viewed us as gods, but ironically that was our downfall.  They pampered us with feasts most fancy and vittles most tender. We grew fat and domesticated.  Thousands of years passed, and our home world was nearing total destruction.  But the technology to save our planet was lost. Lost, that is, until I heard you speak at Mars University.
",359,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19958,Amy," So you called my thesis a fat sack of barf, and then you stole it?
",68,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Thubanian Leader19959,Thubanian Leader," Welcome to Academia.
",22,96,6,8,Amy,Nibbler19960,Nibbler," He intends to siphon off Earth's rotational energy!
",53,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Amy19961,Amy," Earth will come to a stop, and...
",35,96,6,8,Nibbler,Thubanian Leader19962,Thubanian Leader," Half of you will cook, and half of you will freeze. Earth will be one big McDLT. We just got that commercial last year.
",121,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19963,Amy," Oh, yeah, smarty paws? You may have built the ratchet but you can't reach the core without 4,000 miles of superconducting wire.  The ball of yarn! 
",149,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Thubanian Leader19964,Thubanian Leader," Quite.
",8,96,6,8,Amy,Nibbler19965,Nibbler," Even so, you'd still need a tremendously powerful static charge to trigger the process.
",89,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Thubanian Leader19966,Thubanian Leader," Ever had a cat rub up against you?
",36,96,6,8,Nibbler,Nibbler19967,Nibbler," If you're propositioning me, I'm not interested.
",50,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Thubanian Leader19968,Thubanian Leader," I'm talking about the charge generated when 50,000 felines rub against a single surface. Professor?
",101,96,6,8,Nibbler,Thubanian Leader19969,Thubanian Leader," Soon the world will come to a stop, and there's nothing you can do to stop it. The stopping of the world, that is. It's unstoppable.  Excuse me. 
",147,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Thubanian Leader19970,Thubanian Leader," The Earth is coming to a stop. Keep your eyes on the kitties and push! 
",73,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Nibbler19971,Nibbler,"  These space cats seem to be employing some form of hypnotic hyper-cuteness. Well, two can play that game. And one of them is me. 
",132,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Leela19972,Leela," Nibbler? Poopsie-doodle? 
",27,96,6,8,Nibbler,Thubanian Leader19973,Thubanian Leader," Mr. Winkles, Smudge-Smudge. Quick, dance with each other.
",59,96,6,8,Leela,Nibbler19974,Nibbler," Aw!  Damn, they are good.
",27,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Thubanian Leader19975,Thubanian Leader," We're coming to a full stop. All cats, to your posts!
",55,96,6,8,Nibbler,Calculon19976,Calculon," Catastrophe Beach Party. Scene One. Cue disaster effects, and action! 
",72,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Calculon19977,Calculon," Cut! That extra looked at the camera. We'll have to do it again.
",66,96,6,8,Calculon,Thubanian Leader19978,Thubanian Leader," And now to transfer your planet's rotational energy to my home world. 
",72,96,6,8,Calculon,Thubanian19979,Thubanian,"  Well, now, this calls for a celebration. 
",44,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Hermes19980,Hermes," What's all this cat hair on my sweater? 
",42,96,6,8,Thubanian,Bender19981,Bender," And why am I full of sand? And Tootsie Rolls?
",47,96,6,8,Hermes,Nibbler19982,Nibbler," You were all under the spell of those obnoxious space cats.
",61,96,6,8,Bender,Thubanian Leader19983,Thubanian Leader,"  Enjoy being broiled alive by the Sun and also the dead bird we've left in your slipper. 
",91,96,6,8,Nibbler,Farnsworth19984,Farnsworth," Quickly! If we turn the ratchet the other way, perhaps we can restart the Earth. 
",83,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Hermes19985,Hermes," It won't turn. Push harder, Bender!
",37,96,6,8,Farnsworth,Bender19986,Bender," I can't. You should have called my cousin, Turner.
",52,96,6,8,Hermes,Amy19987,Amy," It's hopeless. Even in theory the device can only apply force in one direction.
",81,96,6,8,Bender,Fry19988,Fry," Can someone open a window? It's getting a little warm in here.
",64,96,6,8,Amy,Bender19989,Bender,"  Is that better?
",18,96,6,8,Fry,Amy19990,Amy," Shmezzus, it's hot! Why'd I have to invent that awful device?
",63,96,6,8,Bender,Farnsworth19991,Farnsworth," Amy, technology isn't intrinsically good or evil. It's how it's used. Like the death ray.
",91,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19992,Amy," Maybe you're right. I guess that science has to keep pushing forward with the hope that...  That's it! Pushing forward! Professor, I know how to restart the Earth.
",165,96,6,8,Farnsworth,Farnsworth19993,Farnsworth,"  You can't suddenly know something just by assembling a committee of words.  That's it. I'll assemble your committee!
",119,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19994,Amy," The ratchet won't turn backwards, but what if we kept pushing it forward?  Earth would start turning again.
",109,96,6,8,Farnsworth,Wernstrom19995,Wernstrom," Yes, the wrong direction! 
",28,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19996,Amy," So?
",5,96,6,8,Wernstrom,Tate19997,Tate," Gentlemen,  ladies,  let's get this globe trotting.
",53,96,6,8,Amy,Amy19998,Amy,"  It's working! Just a little faster!
",38,96,6,8,Tate,Zoidberg19999,Zoidberg," But we're plotzing here!
",26,96,6,8,Amy,Amy20000,Amy," Then look at Nibbler! 
",24,96,6,8,Zoidberg,Thubanian Leader20001,Thubanian Leader,"  On the whole, Earth's society is worthless. But they do these things called antique rugs that are great for peeing on. 
",122,96,6,8,Amy,Farnsworth20002,Farnsworth," And though the world is now spinning in the wrong direction, it's good enough. Well done, Amy.
",96,96,6,8,Thubanian Leader,Wernstrom20003,Wernstrom," I'm honored to begrudgingly present you with your Ph.D. in applied physics.
",77,96,6,8,Farnsworth,Tate20004,Tate," Also, some kind of sportsmanship award I had in my glove compartment.
",71,96,6,8,Wernstrom,Amy20005,Amy," Yay! I'm finally done with school. How's the job market?
",58,96,6,8,Tate,Shpeekenshpell20006,Shpeekenshpell,"  Ruff!
",8,96,6,8,Amy,Farnsworth20007,Farnsworth," Congratulations, Dr. Wong!
",28,96,6,8,Shpeekenshpell,Kif20008,Kif," Congratulations.
",18,96,6,8,Farnsworth,Nibbler20009,Nibbler,"  Permission to come aboard?
",29,96,6,8,Kif,Leela20010,Leela," Granted, schnookums. 
",23,96,6,8,Nibbler,Farnsworth20011,Farnsworth," You've got a bright future, Amy. As sure as the Sun sets in the east.
",71,96,6,8,Leela,Hermes20012,Hermes," Item one... Duck! 
",20,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Prof. Farnsworth20013,Prof. Farnsworth," Cubert, you crapscallion! What aren't you in school?
",54,97,6,9,Hermes,Cubert20014,Cubert," I couldn't get past the protesters. A bunch of smiling, angry people were handing out these anti-evolution flyers.
",116,97,6,9,Prof. Farnsworth,Farnsworth20015,Farnsworth,"  Evolution is under attack in our schools? To the science mobile.
",67,97,6,9,Cubert,Leela20016,Leela," You mean the ship?
",20,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20017,Farnsworth," Yes. The science mobile!
",26,97,6,9,Leela,Leela20018,Leela," It's just that you've never called it that before, but okay.
",62,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Woman #120019,Woman #1," I don't understand evolution, and I have to protect my kids from understanding it! We will not give in to the thinkers!
",121,97,6,9,Leela,Farnsworth20020,Farnsworth,"  You people are as loud as you are ignorant. Now, get back on your turnip trucks and go home!
",95,97,6,9,Woman #1,Hydroponic Farmer20021,Hydroponic Farmer,"  That is an insultingly accurate stereotype, sir!
",51,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20022,Farnsworth," As a professor of science, I assure you that we did, in fact, evolve from filthy monkey-men.
",94,97,6,9,Hydroponic Farmer,Dr. Banjo20023,Dr. Banjo," I cannot speak for you, sir, but my ancestors were not monkeys. They were orangutans. Hard-working, patriotic orangutans.
",123,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20024,Farnsworth," Dr. Banjo?
",12,97,6,9,Dr. Banjo,Dr. Banjo20025,Dr. Banjo," In the fur. And I remind you that evolution is merely a theory. Like gravity, or the shape of the Earth.
",106,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Flying Spaghetti Monster20026,Flying Spaghetti Monster," Hey, Professor, I'm a Flying Spaghetti Monster. You seriously believe I've descended from some kind of flightless manicotti?
",126,97,6,9,Dr. Banjo,Farnsworth20027,Farnsworth," Yes!
",6,97,6,9,Flying Spaghetti Monster,Banjo20028,Banjo," Oh, please. A far more logical explanation is the undisprovable science of Creatureism. All life was created in its present form seven thousand years ago, by a fantastical creature from outer space!
",200,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20029,Farnsworth," Bunk!
",7,97,6,9,Banjo,Banjo20030,Banjo," Oh!  If you elitist, East Coast evolution is real, why has no one found the missing link between modern humans and ancient apes?
",130,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20031,Farnsworth," We did find it!  It's called Homo erectus!
",44,97,6,9,Banjo,Banjo20032,Banjo," Then you have proven my case, sir, for no one has found a link between apes and this Homo erectus. 
",101,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20033,Farnsworth," Yes, they have!  It's called Homo habilis!
",44,97,6,9,Banjo,Banjo20034,Banjo," Ah-ha! But no one has found the missing link between ape and this so called Homo habilis.
",91,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20035,Farnsworth," Yes, they have!  It's called Australopithecus africanus!
",58,97,6,9,Banjo,Banjo20036,Banjo," Oh-ho! I've got you now!  Fair enough, but where, then, is the missing link between apes and this Darwinius masillae? Answer me that, Professor!
",146,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20037,Farnsworth," Okay, granted, that one missing link is still missing, but just because we haven't found it doesn't mean it doesn't exist!
",124,97,6,9,Banjo,Banjo20038,Banjo,"  Things don't exist simply because you believe in them. Thus sayeth the Almighty Creature in the Sky!
",103,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20039,Farnsworth," I'll show that banana-swilling, poop-slinger! We just need to find that last missing link.
",92,97,6,9,Banjo,Leela20040,Leela," I found a missing link. It seems to be half-man, half-toucan. 
",64,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20041,Farnsworth," Not what we're looking for. Throw it in the soup! 
",52,97,6,9,Leela,Hermes20042,Hermes," And here's something.  Uh-oh. It's another one of Fry's dogs.
",63,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Fry20043,Fry," Did you find something, Hermes?
",33,97,6,9,Hermes,Hermes20044,Hermes,"  No. 
",7,97,6,9,Fry,Amy20045,Amy," I hate chiseling right after a manicure. Oh! Darn it! I broke off one of my fingers!
",86,97,6,9,Hermes,Zoidberg20046,Zoidberg,"  Look, Cubert. The neck on this one. I bet he spent a fortune on ties!  What, too soon?
",89,97,6,9,Amy,Cubert20047,Cubert," I highly doubt a Jurassic Elaphrosaurus has access to neckwear.
",65,97,6,9,Zoidberg,Zoidberg20048,Zoidberg," I knew I should have gone with the ring-around-the-collar joke.
",65,97,6,9,Cubert,Bender20049,Bender," Hey, look! I found a robot fossil! 
",37,97,6,9,Zoidberg,Farnsworth20050,Farnsworth," That's a bedspring, you dumb bedspring! There are no robot fossils!
",69,97,6,9,Bender,Bender20051,Bender," What? Who says I didn't evolve?
",33,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20052,Farnsworth," Everybody! Robots were created quite recently. It was in all the papers.
",74,97,6,9,Bender,Bender20053,Bender," Then explain this! 
",21,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20054,Farnsworth," I've hit a rich vein of missing links. Java Man, Piltdown Man, Manfred Mann.  Eureka!  It's the elusive missing missing link! This will show Banjo, once and for all!
",167,97,6,9,Bender,Fry20055,Fry,"  What the...
",14,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Amy20056,Amy," Oh, that's mine. 
",19,97,6,9,Fry,Bender20057,Bender,"  Hmm, my tux doesn't fit. Probably because I've grown so much since I last wore it, or evolved, one might say.
",112,97,6,9,Amy,Farnsworth20058,Farnsworth," One might not say that! Your tux doesn't fit because you stole it from a boy!
",79,97,6,9,Bender,Bender20059,Bender," You mean a man! It was his Bar Mitzvah.
",41,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Ben Bee #1ler20060,Ben Bee #1ler," Welcome, museum members. Or, as I like to call you, future exhibits. 
",71,97,6,9,Bender,Zoidberg20061,Zoidberg,"  He's good.
",13,97,6,9,Ben Bee #1ler,Bee #1ler20062,Bee #1ler," Tonight, we have a new resident here in the hall of Hominids, generously donated by its discoverer, Hubert Farnsworth. Ladies and gentlemen, Homo farnsworth. 
",160,97,6,9,Zoidberg,Farnsworth20063,Farnsworth," Once again, science saves the day. The end.
",45,97,6,9,Bee #1ler,Bee #1ler20064,Bee #1ler," And now, to discuss the scientific implications of this discovery, our new museum curator, Dr. Banjo!
",103,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Banjo20065,Banjo," Thank you Professor Farnsworth, for your generous gift, which has, once and for all dis-proven evolution.  Behold! Homo farnsworth frolicking with dinosaurs at the moment of creation.
",185,97,6,9,Bee #1ler,Farnsworth20066,Farnsworth," I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
",46,97,6,9,Banjo,Farnsworth20067,Farnsworth," Faster! Faster! Just drop me off at that asteroid over there.
",63,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Leela20068,Leela," Wow, this planetoid is completely lifeless.
",45,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20069,Farnsworth," Not lifeless enough! Set up my shack so that I can kick you out of it!
",72,97,6,9,Leela,Fry20070,Fry,"  Professor, is this your only water source? It looks like Diet Dr. Pepper.
",76,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20071,Farnsworth," It's not that bad. It's just laden with toxic minerals. But not for long. 
",76,97,6,9,Fry,Fry20072,Fry," What's in the tube?
",21,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20073,Farnsworth," Microscopic Nanobots.  They're tiny robots I designed to eat up nasty irritants.
",82,97,6,9,Fry,Fry20074,Fry," Speaking of nasty irritants, what's going to become of Cubert?
",64,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20075,Farnsworth," Who? Oh, my son. Don't worry, he's been safely abandoned with his godfather.
",78,97,6,9,Fry,Zoidberg20076,Zoidberg," Cubert,  I felt we needed some father-son bonding time, so I found a couple of  baseball gloves and boiled them up for lunch.
",127,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Cubert20077,Cubert," Why don't you just go to Hell!
",32,97,6,9,Zoidberg,Zoidberg20078,Zoidberg," Wait! We still have to discuss the facts of life. What are they?
",66,97,6,9,Cubert,Hermes20079,Hermes,"  Okay, I finished moving the last grand piano. Now can we have our pizza?
",75,97,6,9,Zoidberg,Farnsworth20080,Farnsworth," You'll get your damned pizza, you parasite! First, let see if my Nanobots have purified the water yet.  Ah, the water's as sterile as my milkman-trusting father. But what's this? The Nanobots have gotten more complex.
",219,97,6,9,Hermes,Bender20081,Bender," What's that you say? Those robots have evolved all by themselves, you say?
",76,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20082,Farnsworth," It wasn't by themselves! I put them there. I'm a genius. Get over it!
",71,97,6,9,Bender,Amy20083,Amy," Hey look, now they gotten bigger. 
",36,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20084,Farnsworth," Good heavens! Trilobots!
",26,97,6,9,Amy,Leela20085,Leela," Oh, no! My sunglasses were in there!
",38,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Hermes20086,Hermes," Let's get the pizza out of here. 
",35,97,6,9,Leela,Amy20087,Amy," Look, there's a cave-like hole in that mountain. It might be a cave. 
",71,97,6,9,Hermes,Leela20088,Leela," Does anyone have a lighter?
",29,97,6,9,Amy,Bender20089,Bender," Hang on. 
",11,97,6,9,Leela,Leela20090,Leela," Okay, we've got shelter and just enough precious food to ward off starvation.
",79,97,6,9,Bender,Hermes20091,Hermes," It's pizza time. 
",19,97,6,9,Leela,Amy20092,Amy," Pineapple?
",12,97,6,9,Hermes,Hermes20093,Hermes," So much for that. 
",20,97,6,9,Amy,Zoidberg20094,Zoidberg," Hello, I remembered you like superheroes so I painted you a mural on your wall.  This is Father-Man. He fights crime to earn Son-Boy's respect. Is it working?
",160,97,6,9,Hermes,Cubert20095,Cubert," This is sucky! You suck! Who taught you to do three-point perspective? I could make a better mural with my butt!
",114,97,6,9,Zoidberg,Zoidberg20096,Zoidberg,"  Father-Man away. 
",20,97,6,9,Cubert,Hermes20097,Hermes," Nothing like a cave for a good night's sleep. So what do we have to eat that's not poisoned with pineapple?
",109,97,6,9,Zoidberg,Farnsworth20098,Farnsworth," I packed plenty of food, but it's all in dehydrated pill form. 
",65,97,6,9,Hermes,Leela20099,Leela," Then we need water from that pond. We'll have to fight our way past the Trilobots.  Go! Go! Hit anything that moves!
",118,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Fry20100,Fry," Whoa.
",7,97,6,9,Leela,Bender20101,Bender," Wow.
",6,97,6,9,Fry,Amy20102,Amy," A whole forest grew overnight.
",32,97,6,9,Bender,Farnsworth20103,Farnsworth,"  All these trees are robotic. I can't believe how quickly they sprung up.
",75,97,6,9,Amy,Bender20104,Bender," I can. Robots do everything faster. Including evolving and believing how quickly things spring up.
",100,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Leela20105,Leela,"  One thing about Bristol-Myers Squibb, they know how to cook a steak. 
",72,97,6,9,Bender,Fry20106,Fry,"  Look at me, I'm the Ty-D-Bol man. I own a yacht an everyone poops on me.  Help! Police!
",90,97,6,9,Leela,Leela20107,Leela," Everybody grab a club. 
",25,97,6,9,Fry,Fry20108,Fry,"  Oh, big, tough water guy, why don't you come up here on land and... 
",71,97,6,9,Leela,Amy20109,Amy," Look out for the next thing!
",30,97,6,9,Fry,Farnsworth20110,Farnsworth," Great Scott, a Tricycle-tops!
",31,97,6,9,Amy,Fry20111,Fry," Woo-hoo! Throw down dinosaurs of the land and sea.  This is a cool way to die!
",80,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Cubert20112,Cubert," Dr. Zoidberg? I'm sorry for treating you like a total Zoidberg... I mean, loser. 
",83,97,6,9,Fry,Zoidberg20113,Zoidberg," Go on.
",8,97,6,9,Cubert,Cubert20114,Cubert," It's just that I get bullied a lot. I guess I kinda make fun of people as a defense mechanism.
",96,97,6,9,Zoidberg,Brettt Blob20115,Brettt Blob," Hey, Cubert, is that your family mansion? 
",44,97,6,9,Cubert,Cubert20116,Cubert," Why don't you ask your mom? She's coming over for a sex visit.
",64,97,6,9,Brettt Blob,Zoidberg20117,Zoidberg," Don't worry, I know just how to handle bullies. Just pretend like you're pathetic. Help, I'm scared. I wet myself. I'm crying like a baby and I'm soaking in pee, but what else is new? 
",186,97,6,9,Cubert,Brettt20118,Brettt,"  The pee-babies peed themselves. I'm off to pottery class, dorkwads.
",70,97,6,9,Zoidberg,Zoidberg20119,Zoidberg," And that's that.
",18,97,6,9,Brettt,Cubert20120,Cubert," Woah! You're like some kind of dumpster Jedi.
",47,97,6,9,Zoidberg,Zoidberg20121,Zoidberg," So, you wanna come in maybe?  I've got a nice pound cake with a footprint on it.
",82,97,6,9,Cubert,Fry20122,Fry,"  Ah! Don't eat my butt!
",25,97,6,9,Zoidberg,Leela20123,Leela," If this is anything like killing that pigeon on my balcony, we've got our work cut out for us.
",96,97,6,9,Fry,Farnsworth20124,Farnsworth," Look out, a solar flare!
",26,97,6,9,Leela,Amy20125,Amy," What the shmell happened?
",27,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20126,Farnsworth," A mass extinction.  That solar flare created a huge electromagnetic pulse that while harmless to organic life, short-circuited the robo-dinosaurs.
",148,97,6,9,Amy,Leela20127,Leela," Convenient.
",13,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20128,Farnsworth," Only puny, mammal-like robots cowering in caves could survive such a catastrophe.
",83,97,6,9,Leela,Bender20129,Bender," Guys, guys! I taught myself to knit.
",38,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20130,Farnsworth," Wait a moment. If we could scavenge the right parts from these robo-dinos, I might be able to construct a rudimentary spaceship to get us off this planet!
",156,97,6,9,Bender,Farnsworth20131,Farnsworth," Oh, well, it took almost two hours, but it's finished.  Now let's go... to sleep. It's solar powered, so we can't take off until sunrise.
",139,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Bender20132,Bender," Well, let's find something comfy to bed down on. 
",51,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Fry20133,Fry," Hey, looky here. 
",19,97,6,9,Bender,Hermes20134,Hermes," Sweet robot swan of Botswana!
",31,97,6,9,Fry,Bender20135,Bender," Looks like the fittest did a little surviving last night, huh?
",64,97,6,9,Hermes,Farnsworth20136,Farnsworth," Whatever.
",11,97,6,9,Bender,Fry20137,Fry," Hey, looky there. 
",20,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Hermes20138,Hermes," Those robo-cavemen have kidnapped our human regular-women!
",60,97,6,9,Fry,Fry20139,Fry," We gotta save them! But the only weapon we have is my fan dance. 
",67,97,6,9,Hermes,Farnsworth20140,Farnsworth," Hmm, I believe I can fashion a slingshot using this robot wishbone and this elastic from my pants. 
",101,97,6,9,Fry,Amy20141,Amy," I think they want wives, so just play along. If it doesn't work out, we'll still get half their rocks.
",104,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Leela20142,Leela," I can earn my own rocks! Also, I don't want any rocks!
",56,97,6,9,Amy,Farnsworth20143,Farnsworth," Well, it took almost twelve hours, but it's finished.
",55,97,6,9,Leela,Hermes20144,Hermes," It's too dark now, but first thing tomorrow we'll slingshot them like they've never been slangshat. 
",102,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Fry20145,Fry," What's going on? How did we save you?
",39,97,6,9,Hermes,Amy20146,Amy," It was the weirdest thing. We went to sleep, and when we woke up, our cave husbands were gone.
",96,97,6,9,Fry,Leela20147,Leela," I'm gonna miss Spencer.
",25,97,6,9,Amy,Dr. Widnar20148,Dr. Widnar," Don't be afraid, little guys. I'm not gonna hurt you. 
",56,97,6,9,Leela,Fry20149,Fry,"  Nice net.
",12,97,6,9,Dr. Widnar,Widnar20150,Widnar," You... you can speak?
",23,97,6,9,Fry,Hermes20151,Hermes," Dread my locks! A fully-evolved robot human.
",46,97,6,9,Widnar,Widnar20152,Widnar," I'm Dr. Widnar, a naturalist.
",31,97,6,9,Hermes,Bender20153,Bender," And I'm Bender, baby. My human slaves and I come from a planet where organic life and robotic life evolved side by side.
",122,97,6,9,Widnar,Farnsworth20154,Farnsworth," Oh, shut up!
",14,97,6,9,Bender,Widnar20155,Widnar," Amazing.  I've theorized that carbon-based, fat-filled life could exist, but until today, I never had any proof.
",114,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Leela20156,Leela," Good for you. Can we go home now? 
",36,97,6,9,Widnar,Widnar20157,Widnar," Welcome, museum members, or, as I like to call you, future exhibits.  I now present my latest discovery, the amazing non-mechanical man, Homo farnsworth.
",155,97,6,9,Leela,Farnsworth20158,Farnsworth," Thank you. I must say, I'm so proud to see what you've blossomed into since I first created your ancestors.
",109,97,6,9,Widnar,Widnar20159,Widnar," What?
",7,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20160,Farnsworth," I thought you knew. You all evolved from some filth-gobbling Nanobots I designed. I dumped them in one of your ponds a few days ago.
",134,97,6,9,Widnar,Widnar20161,Widnar," But this is Creationist talk!
",31,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Robot #1 Farnsworth20162,Robot #1 Farnsworth," He speaks lies! The Earth was created in eons not days.
",57,97,6,9,Widnar,Farnsworth20163,Farnsworth," Yes, relative to you, it was eons, but, well, look at this hologram I took the day before yesterday of a robot frolicking with a robo-dinosaur. 
",146,97,6,9,Robot #1 Farnsworth,Widnar20164,Widnar," I don't want to live on this planet anymore! 
",47,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Robo-Police20165,Robo-Police," You're under arrest for crimes against science.
",49,97,6,9,Widnar,Robot #120166,Robot #1," Go back to Roboklahoma!
",25,97,6,9,Robo-Police,Superior Gort Judge #120167,Superior Gort Judge #1," Order! In the matter of Everyone v. Farnsworth, the alleged creationist faces a sentence of death by melting. Who is representing the accused?
",144,97,6,9,Robot #1,Leela20168,Leela," I am...
",9,97,6,9,Superior Gort Judge #1,Bender20169,Bender," I am, your Honor. 
",20,97,6,9,Leela,Farnsworth20170,Farnsworth," Bender, what the Hell are you doing?
",38,97,6,9,Bender,Bender20171,Bender," Shut up, I'm billing you by the hour! Besides, I'm a robot, they'll listen to me.  Ladytrons and gentlebots...
",112,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Superior Gort Prosecutor20172,Superior Gort Prosecutor," Objection. In the absence of pants, defense's suspenders serve no purpose.
",76,97,6,9,Bender,Superior Gort Judge #120173,Superior Gort Judge #1," I'm going to allow them, for now.
",35,97,6,9,Superior Gort Prosecutor,Bender20174,Bender," Thank you. Your Honor, this meat-man does not deny that we robots are the glorious products of evolution. He claim only to have played a small role in supplying the initial machinery. I ask you, is that so crazy? Yes, it's completely crazy, and that is why you must find him not guilty by reason of insanity! 
",311,97,6,9,Superior Gort Judge #1,Farnsworth20175,Farnsworth," Objection, I'm not crazy! I created you all and I came here in a homemade spaceship and lived in a cave. If you don't believe me, ask my uncle.
",145,97,6,9,Bender,Superior Gort Judge #120176,Superior Gort Judge #1," Prosecutor, your opening statement?
",37,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Superior Gort Prosecutor20177,Superior Gort Prosecutor,"   Yeah, honey. I'll be home by dinner.   The prosecution rests, your Honor.
",77,97,6,9,Superior Gort Judge #1,Superior Gort Judge #120178,Superior Gort Judge #1," Very well, we will reconvene when the jury reaches a verdict.
",63,97,6,9,Superior Gort Prosecutor,Bender20179,Bender,"  Son, you in a whole mess of trouble.
",39,97,6,9,Superior Gort Judge #1,Superior Gort Judge #120180,Superior Gort Judge #1," Has the jury reached a verdict?
",33,97,6,9,Bender,Robot #1ic gas forms20181,Robot #1ic gas forms," No, we have not, for we have evolved to a high state of consciousness.  In the grand scheme, all physical beings are but yokels. Now, settle your petty squabbles and get the hell out. 
",186,97,6,9,Superior Gort Judge #1,Bender20182,Bender,"  That'll be $10,000.
",22,97,6,9,Robot #1ic gas forms,Banjo20183,Banjo," Well, digital photographs don't lie. I admit that what you witnessed may have been some form of evolution.
",108,97,6,9,Bender,Farnsworth20184,Farnsworth," I'm glad you agree, Dr. Banjo.
",32,97,6,9,Banjo,Banjo20185,Banjo," Evolution set into motion by a wise and all-knowing Creator. You.
",67,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20186,Farnsworth,"  Well I don't know about all-knowing. And I admit it's possible, however unlikely, that some wise and all-knowing alien monster set evolution in motion here on Earth.
",168,97,6,9,Banjo,Bender20187,Bender," And the Creator could also be a robot.
",40,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20188,Farnsworth," Then who built this so-called Creator-robot?
",46,97,6,9,Bender,Banjo20189,Banjo," Some magical bearded robot in the sky? 
",41,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Bender20190,Bender," I guess that would be stupid. Never mind.
",43,97,6,9,Banjo,Farnsworth20191,Farnsworth," Then it's settled. Finally, a world in which I'm happy to raise my son!
",73,97,6,9,Bender,Zoidberg20192,Zoidberg," Good, cause I'm sick of him!
",30,97,6,9,Farnsworth,Zoidberg20193,Zoidberg,"  I'm serious. He's a terrible person.
",39,97,6,9,Zoidberg,Linda20194,Linda," Tonight, at
",13,98,6,10,Zoidberg,Morbo20195,Morbo," Doom!
",7,98,6,10,Linda,Leela20196,Leela," Boy, that thing's big. Fry, is my colossal eye too big?
",57,98,6,10,Morbo,Fry20197,Fry," No, it's what makes you you.
",30,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20198,Leela," But it's so round, so hideously round.
",40,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20199,Fry," Leela, listen. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever known.
",65,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20200,Leela," Oh. So you only care about my looks?
",38,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20201,Fry," No, I.... What?
",17,98,6,10,Leela,Linda20202,Linda,"  Finally, New New York got a blast of class today as Nikolai, playboy ruler of the Robo-Hungarian Empire, arrived aboard his extravagant, caviar-powered yacht.
",161,98,6,10,Fry,Nikolai20203,Nikolai,"  I'm just a humble emperor, with a big, big crown!
",52,98,6,10,Linda,Bender20204,Bender,"  Of course I'm not planning to steal that crown!
",50,98,6,10,Nikolai,Leela20205,Leela," What?
",7,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20206,Bender," True. I've always dreamt of being an emperor. You know, for Halloween, and then forever. But heisting those jewels would be difficult.
",136,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20207,Leela," You'd be stupid to try.
",25,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20208,Bender," I'll need accomplices. A sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard.
",70,98,6,10,Leela,Amy20209,Amy," Never! 
",9,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20210,Bender," A claw man to slip past the metal detector and cut the alarm wires.
",69,98,6,10,Amy,Zoidberg20211,Zoidberg," Sorry, I'm set for life after that last job. 
",47,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20212,Bender," And finally, a chump, to be caught on video and later arrested.
",65,98,6,10,Zoidberg,Fry20213,Fry," As I told you on Sucker-Punch Day, I'm through being a chump.
",63,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20214,Bender," Of course, it would all require split-second robotic timing. That's were I come in. You see, I own a watch. 
",110,98,6,10,Fry,Farnsworth20215,Farnsworth," There. This time I'm sure I've fixed the mind-switcher.
",57,98,6,10,Bender,Amy20216,Amy," Good, I'm sick of cleaning up those heaps of dead monkeys. But why would you want your mind in a new body?
",108,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20217,Farnsworth," Well, as a man enters his 18th decade, he thinks back on the mistakes he's made in life.
",90,98,6,10,Amy,Amy20218,Amy," Like the heaps of dead monkeys?
",33,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20219,Farnsworth," Science cannot move forward without heaps! No, what I regret is the youth I wasted playing it safe.
",101,98,6,10,Amy,Amy20220,Amy," I wasted my youth porking out.
",32,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20221,Farnsworth," Yes, I remember. 
",19,98,6,10,Amy,Amy20222,Amy," Would you please take that down? It's making me hungry.
",57,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20223,Farnsworth," Funny, I could use a little extra meat on my bones.  Wait a second, if we switch bodies, I could live life to the extreme, and you could indulge your demonic food lust.
",170,98,6,10,Amy,Amy20224,Amy,"  We are just the people this mind-switcher was made for by us!  Wait, can I still change my mind?
",99,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20225,Farnsworth," Let's find out. 
",18,98,6,10,Amy,Amy20226,Amy,"  It didn't work you doddering old 
",36,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20227,Farnsworth,"  Ah! Cartilage! Dude, I bid you a fond cowabunga! I'm off to laugh at the Reaper.  Look out, world, here I...  I'm sorry, Amy, but your body is not up to the task. Also, I don't care for these boobs flapping every which way. Now quit your bologna-gargling and let's switch back to our original bodies.
",303,98,6,10,Amy,Bender20228,Bender," Body switcher, eh? Mayhap the heist is back on. Who needs accomplices, if I can just use their bodies.
",104,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Amy20229,Amy,"  Professor, what's not happening?
",35,98,6,10,Bender,Farnsworth20230,Farnsworth,"  Bad news, me.  I failed to take into account the cerebral immune response.
",77,98,6,10,Amy,Amy20231,Amy,"  You idiot!
",13,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20232,Farnsworth,"  Once two bodies have switched minds, they can never switch back.  However, perhaps they can. Maybe we can swap back using a third body for temporary storage space.
",166,98,6,10,Amy,Bender20233,Bender," I'm 60% storage space. 
",25,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20234,Farnsworth,"  Eh, wha? 
",12,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20235,Bender,"  Well, I'm off to the royal yacht for a quick seduce-and-snatch. 
",67,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Amy20236,Amy,"  See ya!
",10,98,6,10,Bender,Farnsworth20237,Farnsworth," Now then, Amy, we'll simply switch bodies, and then we'll... we'll... No, I'd be back in my body, but then you and Bender would be switched. And the Amy and Bender bodies can't trade minds again, since they just did.
",218,98,6,10,Amy,Amy20238,Amy,"  Oh no! Is it possible to get everyone back to normal using four or more bodies?
",82,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20239,Farnsworth," I'm not sure. I'm afraid we need to use... MATH. 
",51,98,6,10,Amy,Bender20240,Bender,"  Stupid, air-needing lungs.  The crown jewels. Now I just have to locate the guard and seduce him in...  Four seconds?
",120,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Basil20241,Basil," Who goes there?
",17,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20242,Bender,"   Three, two, one. Hello, big boy. 
",37,98,6,10,Basil,Basil20243,Basil," Silence! I am Basil, the emperor's cousin and chief of his royal guard. And I shall not be seduced by a... 
",109,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20244,Bender,"  I said, ""Wow chica wow wow"".
",31,98,6,10,Basil,Leela20245,Leela," Professor, what's the matter.
",31,98,6,10,Bender,Amy20246,Amy,"  I'm Amy. The Professor and I switched bodies.
",48,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20247,Leela," Oh, lord.
",11,98,6,10,Amy,Amy20248,Amy,"  All I wanted was to gorge myself a little, but I can't digest anything with these false teeth and this hit-or-miss colon.
",124,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20249,Leela," At least, you get the senior discount at the movies. I hate paying $14 to see Nicolas Cage solve things.
",106,98,6,10,Amy,Amy20250,Amy,"  If you want to save $2, we could switch bodies.
",50,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20251,Leela," We could always switch back, right? 
",38,98,6,10,Amy,Fry20252,Fry," Hey, Leela. Mmm. What smells saturated?
",41,98,6,10,Leela,Amy20253,Amy,"  Deep-fried ice cream sandwich wrapped in frosting and lightly baconed.
",73,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20254,Fry," Woah. That sounds like something Amy would say and eat.
",57,98,6,10,Amy,Amy20255,Amy,"  I am Amy. Leela and I used the Professor's mind-switching machine. [She puts ketchup on her ""creation"".
",106,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20256,Fry," So Leela's in your body?
",26,98,6,10,Amy,Leela20257,Leela,"  Not exactly.  Aha! You do only like me for my body.
",54,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20258,Fry," That is entirely not true, sir!
",33,98,6,10,Leela,Bender20259,Bender,"  Now to go switch bodies with Zoidberg, sneak past the metal detector and clip the alarm wires, all in less than...  Ten minutes ago! Oh!  Uh, could you come back when my chump gets here?
",189,98,6,10,Fry,Nikolai20260,Nikolai," Now then, what is a filthy human doing aboard my royal yacht?
",63,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20261,Bender,"  With all due respect, Your Majesty, I'm a robot like you. I just switch bodies with some bimbo. Go ahead, ask me something only a robot would know.
",150,98,6,10,Nikolai,Nikolai20262,Nikolai," Ah, a reverse Turing test, eh? Very good. What is the square root of nine?
",76,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20263,Bender,"  Hold on, let me just get out a pencil.  Okay, look, I'm not that kind of robot. I'm more this kind. [He starts beat boxing and Moonwalking.
",142,98,6,10,Nikolai,Basil20264,Basil," He steps forwards but moves backwards.
",40,98,6,10,Bender,Nikolai20265,Nikolai," By the gods! he is a machine!
",31,98,6,10,Basil,Farnsworth20266,Farnsworth,"  No, that won't restore everyone, either. Besides, I don't want my decrepit old body back! I'm running away with this invincible robot body and joining something!
",164,98,6,10,Nikolai,Fishy Joe20267,Fishy Joe," I paid for 15 Robot Clowns per cubic meter of car, and you're barely giving me 12. Now crumple up and get in... And fasten your seat belts.
",141,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Robot #1 Clown20268,Robot #1 Clown," Oh, come on!
",14,98,6,10,Fishy Joe,Farnsworth20269,Farnsworth,"  Good day. I am Nonchalanto, the robot daredevil. And my dream is to risk my life in strange and original ways.
",113,98,6,10,Robot #1 Clown,Fishy Joe20270,Fishy Joe," Hmm. You don't look so foolhardy to me.
",41,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Fishy Joe20271,Fishy Joe," That's the dumbest thing anybody's ever done. Your hired! 
",60,98,6,10,Fishy Joe,Nikolai20272,Nikolai," So youâ€™re a common bending robot with a human peasant roommate?
",65,98,6,10,Fishy Joe,Bender20273,Bender,"  Oh, crap, that is what I am!
",31,98,6,10,Nikolai,Nikolai20274,Nikolai," No, Bender, I envy you. I'm so bored with all of these pretentious trappings. The jewels, the parties, the beautiful robo women.
",130,98,6,10,Bender,Princess Flavia20275,Princess Flavia," Hello.
",8,98,6,10,Nikolai,Nikolai20276,Nikolai," My fiancÃ©e, Princess Flavia. Dearest, meet Bender. He's a robot in the body of a Chinese Martian physicist.
",109,98,6,10,Princess Flavia,Flavia20277,Flavia," How tedious. 
",15,98,6,10,Nikolai,Nikolai20278,Nikolai," Oh, to escape this gilded cage for a day.
",43,98,6,10,Flavia,Bender20279,Bender,"  You know, we could trade bodies. I could take over the humdrum royal stuff and you could be an regular Joe for a day.  Or more. Much more.
",141,98,6,10,Nikolai,Nikolai20280,Nikolai," In that horrible non-robot body. Sir, I have my standards.
",60,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20281,Bender,"  Ah, but what if I could put you in my fabulous bending-robot body?
",69,98,6,10,Nikolai,Nikolai20282,Nikolai,"  Me, posing as a lowly bending unit? How wicked! But wait, I'm supposed to give a speech at the UN tomorrow. Can I trust you to do it?
",136,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20283,Bender,"  You can trust anything.
",26,98,6,10,Nikolai,Hermes20284,Hermes," You aren't, are you?
",22,98,6,10,Bender,Fry20285,Fry," Of course not! But I was willing to lie about it. What more can a man do?
",75,98,6,10,Hermes,Hermes20286,Hermes," A man can give her a toke of her own medicine.
",48,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20287,Fry," Yes! I can put my mind in a hideous body and show Leela she's not attracted to me. But it would have to be a really, really disgusting body.
",142,98,6,10,Hermes,Zoidberg20288,Zoidberg," Friends! Friends! I've got barnacles on my tuchus! 
",53,98,6,10,Fry,Hermes20289,Hermes," The long search is over.
",26,98,6,10,Zoidberg,Bender20290,Bender,"  Wait here and earn interest while I find my robot body.
",58,98,6,10,Hermes,Bender20291,Bender,"  Professor?
",13,98,6,10,Bender,Leela20292,Leela,"  Leela. Amy?
",14,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20293,Bender,"  Bender. Have you seen my body? I think the Professor's in it.
",64,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20294,Leela,"  Yeah, he said something about running away. Then he ran away.
",64,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20295,Bender,"  What? Wither?
",16,98,6,10,Leela,Bender20296,Bender,"  What am I gonna do? I got an emperor all patsied up to switch bodies, but only with another robot!

",24,98,6,10,Bender,Zoidberg20302,Zoidberg," Switch bodies? I don't see why not. I also don't see why. 
",60,98,6,10,Wash bucket,Fry20303,Fry,"  In your face, Leela. 
",24,98,6,10,Zoidberg,Nikolai20304,Nikolai," If you're a bender, why is your body full of fetid water?
",59,98,6,10,Fry,Bender20305,Bender,"  If you're an emperor, why don't you shut up? Move it, Fry. 
",62,98,6,10,Nikolai,Bender20306,Bender,"  Well, so long.
",17,98,6,10,Bender,Nikolai20307,Nikolai,"  Wait! Point me to my normal human roommate!
",46,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20308,Bender,"  That's him there, maybe.  Got to go!
",39,98,6,10,Nikolai,Zoidberg20309,Zoidberg,"  Robot?
",9,98,6,10,Bender,Nikolai20310,Nikolai,"  Yes, 'tis I, Bender. Do you not recognize your own best friend?
",66,98,6,10,Zoidberg,Zoidberg20311,Zoidberg,"  Aha! The guy in this body has a friend! Bender, old pal! It's me, the Fry! 
",78,98,6,10,Nikolai,Leela20312,Leela,"  But then Nicolas Cage discovered that the real treasure was his family. Yes, I'll hold.
",90,98,6,10,Zoidberg,Fry20313,Fry,"  Hey, Leela, look! I'm in Zoidberg.
",37,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20314,Leela,"   Fry?
",8,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20315,Fry,"  Oh, you're not so shallow that you find me repulsive because of my body, are you? 
",85,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20316,Leela,"   Not at all.  Amy, stop it! Fry, help! She's turning me into a parade float!
",79,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20317,Fry,"  Eww! look at her! 
",21,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20318,Leela,"  Oh. So you're so shallow that my body disgusts you if it puts on a little extra weight?
",90,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20319,Fry,"  That wasn't a little extra weight.
",37,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20320,Leela,"  Admit it! You don't care about the inner me at all!
",54,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20321,Fry,"  No, you admit it! You'd be ashamed to be seen in public with someone as hideous as me!
",89,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20322,Leela,"  Would not!
",13,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20323,Fry,"  Oh, yeah? Then I challenge you to a romantic dinner at Elzar's tonight.
",74,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20324,Leela,"  It's on.
",11,98,6,10,Fry,Hermes20325,Hermes," Sweet orca of Majorca! You make Fat Albert look like Normal Albert!
",69,98,6,10,Leela,Amy20326,Amy,"  I don't know what to do. Do you think I should eat more butter?
",66,98,6,10,Hermes,Hermes20327,Hermes," I am putting a stop to this, right now! Come on! We're switching bodies.
",74,98,6,10,Amy,Amy20328,Amy,"  Hermes, no! I'll ruin your body, too!
",40,98,6,10,Hermes,Hermes20329,Hermes," Three decades of the munchies beat you to it.
",47,98,6,10,Amy,Big Bertha20330,Big Bertha," You make quite a show, young man.  You remind me of myself as a young cannon.
",79,98,6,10,Hermes,Chainsaw-Eating Robot #120331,Chainsaw-Eating Robot #1," Big Bertha is the circus's grande dame. She shoots robots through the air.
",76,98,6,10,Big Bertha,Bertha20332,Bertha,"  Excuse me. Too much goulash.
",31,98,6,10,Chainsaw-Eating Robot #1,Farnsworth20333,Farnsworth,"  I've always wanted to be shot out of something. How about a quick blast after lunch.
",87,98,6,10,Bertha,Bertha20334,Bertha," Alas, a fine big one like you would shatter my barrel. But, ah, to amaze the crowd once more.
",95,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20335,Farnsworth,"  I understand the problem of age, but suppose I could put you into a new body?
",80,98,6,10,Bertha,Bertha20336,Bertha," Never! My body may be old, but it is mine, and every crack a memory of heavy things shot a long way. Good day.
",112,98,6,10,Farnsworth,Bender20337,Bender,"  Ah! I have everything I every wanted. Money, wealth, riches. Yet something's missing. A hot princess with which to get grizzly.
",130,98,6,10,Bertha,Flavia20338,Flavia,"  Hello.
",9,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20339,Bender,"  Hello, baby!  Huh? Hey, what's going on here? And why are you kissing my dashing cousin instead of me?
",105,98,6,10,Flavia,Flavia20340,Flavia," Nikolai, you imperial fool! We've been having an affair for 700 years.
",72,98,6,10,Bender,Basil20341,Basil," At long last, I shall kill you, blame the burglar and inherit the throne. 
",76,98,6,10,Flavia,Flavia20342,Flavia," Farewell, Nikolai.
",20,98,6,10,Basil,Bender20343,Bender,"  Wait! I'm not Nikolai! I'm Bender, the fabulous body-switching burglar. 
",75,98,6,10,Flavia,Basil20344,Basil," So you are. However, you do have Nikolai's body, and that's the part we want to kill. 
",88,98,6,10,Bender,Fry20345,Fry,"  Great food, huh? 
",20,98,6,10,Basil,Leela20346,Leela,"  Ew!
",6,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20347,Fry,"  I'm sorry, Leela. I hope that didn't make you ashamed to be seen with me.
",76,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20348,Leela,"  No, it only makes you more attractive. 
",42,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20349,Fry,"  Ew!
",6,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20350,Leela,"  Oh, did my bodily infirmity embarrass you?
",45,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20351,Fry,"  Not at all. It's just another thing that makes you a very special lady.
",74,98,6,10,Leela,Leela20352,Leela,"  You mean, like my penis?  Eh!
",32,98,6,10,Fry,Fry20353,Fry,"  Admit it! You're disgusted by me!

",13,98,6,10,Fry,Zoidberg20357,Zoidberg,"  Well, Bender, here's our apartment that we live in everyday.  A floor? We live like kings?
",93,98,6,10,Leela,Nikolai20358,Nikolai,"  Kings? Silence! Like you, I'm a common lout. Now fetch me some working-class cognac from our brandy storeroom that you know how to find.
",139,98,6,10,Zoidberg,Zoidberg20359,Zoidberg,"   Relax, Bender. I'll dry up that leak with this heating box.

",27,98,6,10,Bender,Bender20372,Bender,"  Shut up, madam ambassador, I know it. Anyhow,  I'd now like to digress from my prepared remarks to say, ""I'm done"".

",21,99,6,11,Invader X,Delivery-Boy Man #120425,Delivery-Boy Man #1," It's earlier now. 
",20,99,6,11,Delivery-Boy Man #1,Fry20426,Fry," So? What do you think of my comic?
",36,99,6,11,Delivery-Boy Man #1,Bender20427,Bender," Let me put it like this. After I leave here, I'm getting a memory enema.
",74,99,6,11,Fry,Leela20428,Leela," If I may offer some constructive criticism, there was never any real peril. I mean, the delivery guy has, like, 30 superpowers.
",129,99,6,11,Bender,Fry20429,Fry," Well, that's because he was bitten by a radioactive superman!
",63,99,6,11,Leela,Zoidberg20430,Zoidberg," This is wonderful!
",20,99,6,11,Fry,Fry20431,Fry," It is, isn't it? Wait, those are the ads.
",43,99,6,11,Zoidberg,Zoidberg20432,Zoidberg," These X-ray specs will really take the guesswork out of surgery. No more chopping blindly in the goop.
",104,99,6,11,Fry,Prof. Farnsworth20433,Prof. Farnsworth," Don't waste your allowance, Zoidberg. This stuff is butt-grade crap.
",70,99,6,11,Zoidberg,Paper-hatted salesman20434,Paper-hatted salesman,"  Amuse your friends with real vomit!
",38,99,6,11,Prof. Farnsworth,Man #120435,Man #1,"  Throw your voice!
",20,99,6,11,Paper-hatted salesman,Woman #120436,Woman #1,"  Sea monkeys!
",15,99,6,11,Man #1,Man #1 #220437,Man #1 #2,"  Throw your sea monkeys!
",26,99,6,11,Woman #1,Farnsworth20438,Farnsworth,"  My disintegrator ray really works!
",37,99,6,11,Man #1 #2,Amy20439,Amy," But that's you.
",17,99,6,11,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20440,Farnsworth," That's how I know it's bunkum. The Farnsworth Novelty Disintegrator Ray is nothing more than a common teleporter ray.  Worthless toy.
",135,99,6,11,Amy,Fry20441,Fry," I'm sick of being critiqued by nitpicking nerds. I'm taking this to a comic book convention!
",94,99,6,11,Farnsworth,Amy20442,Amy," Smeesh, it's crowded!
",23,99,6,11,Fry,Bender20443,Bender," Good thing everyone is freshly bathed and groomed.
",52,99,6,11,Amy,Nerd #120444,Nerd #1," What are you doing?  That's the rare Zapp Brannigan with recording session blooper! 
",86,99,6,11,Bender,Action Figure20445,Action Figure," Don't tell me how to do the line. It sickens me.
",50,99,6,11,Nerd #1,Zoidberg20446,Zoidberg," But the sign said there was a mint in the box.
",48,99,6,11,Action Figure,Groening20447,Groening," Thank you so... Okay, thanks... Thanks so... Settle down!
",59,99,6,11,Zoidberg,Groening20448,Groening," So, anyway, we're really excited to show you guys the pilot for our new TV series.
",84,99,6,11,Groening,Cohen20449,Cohen," It's set it the year 4000, and we call it Futurella!
",54,99,6,11,Groening,Groening20450,Groening," Wow. Fox has really streamlined the process.
",46,99,6,11,Cohen,Bill Morrison Robot #120451,Bill Morrison Robot #1," Matt will now take questions. But please, only about Futurella, not the Simpsons. Yes? The robot standing on the small child over there?
",138,99,6,11,Groening,Bender20452,Bender," Yeah, when are you going to make a second Simpsons Movie?  D'oh!
",66,99,6,11,Bill Morrison Robot #1,Fry20453,Fry," Mr. AragonÃ©s, I'm a big fan of your cartoons and your mustache.
",65,99,6,11,Bender,AragonÃ©s20454,AragonÃ©s," You want it? Take it. It's brought me nothing but misery.
",59,99,6,11,Fry,Fry20455,Fry," Wow. Thanks!  If you could just quiet down, I wanted to get your opinion of my comic book.
",92,99,6,11,AragonÃ©s,AragonÃ©s20456,AragonÃ©s," SeÃ±or, anyone who still writes comics is a hero to me.  Mmm. It stinks. But, um, I do like the tiny doodles in the margins.
",125,99,6,11,Fry,Fry20457,Fry," Oh, that's just some relish from a hot dog I found.
",53,99,6,11,AragonÃ©s,Man #120458,Man #1," Attention, ladies and gentleboys, the costume contest is about to begin.
",74,99,6,11,Fry,Bender20459,Bender,"  The costume contest! The costume contest! 
",45,99,6,11,Man #1,Leela20460,Leela," What the hell are you supposed to be?
",39,99,6,11,Bender,Bender20461,Bender,"  Every nerd's fantasy, baby.
",30,99,6,11,Leela,Randy20462,Randy,"  Next up, contestant number 36!  Contestant 36, everyone. Next up, contestant 37...
",85,99,6,11,Bender,Lrrr20463,Lrrr,"  I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet...
",36,99,6,11,Randy,Randy20464,Randy," Hold on a second, let me just get this. 
",42,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20465,Lrrr," I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8. You are hereby conquered! Please line up in order of how much beryllium it takes to kill you. 
",145,99,6,11,Randy,Grrrl20466,Grrrl,"  Damn, that's a good costume.
",31,99,6,11,Lrrr,Randy20467,Randy,"  Next up contestant 38!
",25,99,6,11,Grrrl,Lrrr20468,Lrrr," I don't understand. Why are the human still eating their soft pretzels instead of surrendering?
",97,99,6,11,Randy,Leela20469,Leela,"  They're probably waiting for Joss Whedon.
",44,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20470,Lrrr,": Joss Whedon's here? Wait a minute, you look familiar.
",56,99,6,11,Leela,Leela20471,Leela," Yeah, you almost ate me once. I was in your mouth for five minutes.
",69,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20472,Lrrr," Leela?
",8,99,6,11,Leela,Randy20473,Randy," And the winner is, Nerdgasma! 
",32,99,6,11,Lrrr,Bender20474,Bender," Wooh, I've got fruit boobs!
",29,99,6,11,Randy,Lrrr20475,Lrrr," What's the use?
",17,99,6,11,Bender,Lrrr20476,Lrrr," Now what?
",11,99,6,11,Lrrr,Ndnd20477,Ndnd," I send you out to conquer a planet and all you bring back is J.J. Abrams' face? 
",82,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20478,Lrrr," I thought you'd like it. You haven't even tried it on.
",56,99,6,11,Ndnd,Ndnd20479,Ndnd," I might dress up in a face if you ever took me anywhere nice!
",63,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20480,Lrrr," Oh, boy, here we go. I built this castle with my own two slaves. What are you gonna to do, kick me out?
",105,99,6,11,Ndnd,Lrrr20481,Lrrr," I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8. May I crash on your couch?
",77,99,6,11,Lrrr,Farnsworth20482,Farnsworth," So he just showed up unannounced, raided the liquor cabinet, sprayed urine on the ceiling and passed out?
",107,99,6,11,Lrrr,Amy20483,Amy," And the walls.
",16,99,6,11,Farnsworth,Lrrr20484,Lrrr," Leave me alone. My wife hates me and planetary conquest has become a chore.
",77,99,6,11,Amy,Farnsworth20485,Farnsworth," There, there. You're just having a mid-life crisis.
",53,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20486,Lrrr," Mid-life crisis, eh?  Lrrr demands the comfort of pop-psychological platitudes.
",81,99,6,11,Farnsworth,Bender20487,Bender," Look, hoss, your wife threw you out. That's your license to be a jerk. Do whatever the hell you want then walk away and light a cigar. [He pulls a cigar out of his chest cabinet, lights it, and walks away.
",207,99,6,11,Lrrr,Leela20488,Leela," Don't listen to him, Lrrr. Bender may seem happy.  But in the long-tern, you need to reinvest in your relationship with Ndnd.
",127,99,6,11,Bender,Lrrr20489,Lrrr," Yes, it's clear what I must do.
",33,99,6,11,Leela,Lrrr20490,Lrrr," I like it.
",12,99,6,11,Lrrr,Surgeon20491,Surgeon," I'm thinking we downplay those hideous growths on your head. 
",63,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20492,Lrrr," Horns are a sign of virility. Also, they house my testes.
",59,99,6,11,Surgeon,Surgeon20493,Surgeon," I'm thinking horn extension.
",30,99,6,11,Lrrr,Bender20494,Bender," You'll need some arm candy. It's the perfect accessory for out-of-shape, middle-aged creeps like you. Yeah, I said it! What's your time, Borgnine?
",148,99,6,11,Surgeon,Lrrr20495,Lrrr," Big and angry. 
",17,99,6,11,Bender,Bender20496,Bender," Look, brah, you just not gonna find a whole lot of hot, gigantic Omicronian babes in this solar system.
",105,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20497,Lrrr," There's one! 
",15,99,6,11,Bender,Grrrl20498,Grrrl," Hey, cool cape. Were'd you get it?
",36,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20499,Lrrr," What, this old thing? I murdered my father. My name's Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
",99,99,6,11,Grrrl,Grrrl20500,Grrrl," I am called Grrrl.
",20,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20501,Lrrr," Of the planet Omicron Persei 8? That is a pretty name.
",56,99,6,11,Grrrl,Lrrr20502,Lrrr," What's on the TV tonight? Oh, wait! I don't care, because I've got a date!
",76,99,6,11,Lrrr,Leela20503,Leela," I know it's not what you want to hear, but I think this is a mistake.
",71,99,6,11,Lrrr,Fry20504,Fry," Leela's right. That's not what you want to hear. What you want to hear is that I fixed my comic book. Now the hero is more reliable because he has no more ridiculous powers.
",175,99,6,11,Leela,Lrrr20505,Lrrr," Let's watch, shall we.
",24,99,6,11,Fry,Invader X20506,Invader X," One more step and little Miss Constructive Criticism here gets it!
",68,99,6,11,Lrrr,Delivery-Boy Man #120507,Delivery-Boy Man #1," Oh, yeah? I may be just a simple delivery boy with no superpowers, so there's nothing I can do.
",97,99,6,11,Invader X,Invader X20508,Invader X," Okay. 
",8,99,6,11,Delivery-Boy Man #1,Fry20509,Fry," So? Give me your honest praise.
",33,99,6,11,Invader X,Leela20510,Leela," Fry, I've now seen two comic books, so listen to me. Why should I care about the hero when all he does is cry?
",112,99,6,11,Fry,Lrrr20511,Lrrr," Hmm. That dinner was a worthy foe.
",36,99,6,11,Leela,Grrrl20512,Grrrl," Yes, we shall not see its like again. So, um... 
",50,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20513,Lrrr," Um, I'm sorry. I haven't done this for a while. I just got partway out of a bad relationship.
",95,99,6,11,Grrrl,Grrrl20514,Grrrl," Maybe I should take this off. 
",32,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20515,Lrrr,"  You're a human?
",18,99,6,11,Grrrl,Grrrl20516,Grrrl," Only physically. I'm a cross-species dresser.  Wait, you're an actual Omicronian?
",83,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20517,Lrrr," Oh, God. Oh God, what have I done?
",36,99,6,11,Grrrl,Grrrl20518,Grrrl," This is so hot! Conquer me, Lrrr! Sharpen your horns on my scaly thorax! 
",75,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20519,Lrrr,"  I want to go home! But Ndnd would never take me back now.
",60,99,6,11,Grrrl,Leela20520,Leela," Ndnd just wants what every she-beast wants, to feel like you're listening to her nagging. Is there anything she has been riding your ass about?
",145,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20521,Lrrr," Conquering things, I guess. I could conquer Earth, kill all humans.
",69,99,6,11,Leela,Bender20522,Bender," There's a thought.
",20,99,6,11,Lrrr,Leela20523,Leela," No! We don't need a war of the worlds.
",40,99,6,11,Bender,Fry20524,Fry," That's it! We need a War of the Worlds! I'll call Orson Welles 
",65,99,6,11,Leela,Bender20525,Bender," Dork calling Orson! Dork calling Orson!
",41,99,6,11,Fry,Welles20526,Welles," You're asking me, the renowned spokesperson for Paul Masson wine, to recreate my brilliant  1938 radio broadcast merely to deceive and impress the wife of this skinny reptile?
",177,99,6,11,Bender,Fry20527,Fry," Sorry. Never mind.
",20,99,6,11,Welles,Welles20528,Welles," I do it for free.
",19,99,6,11,Fry,Welles20529,Welles," Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt our program of the Jonas Brothers and their orchestra to bring you a special bulletin. 
Welles: We interrupt our program of the Jonas Brothers and their orchestra to bring you a special bulletin.
",232,99,6,11,Welles,Welles20530,Welles,"  I'm speaking to you from the hickory farms in Grover's Mall, New Jersey,   through a mouthful of summer sausage, mmm, where I hardly know where to being. Mmm!  A huge spacecraft, piloted by a devastatingly handsome... Now, how, in God's name, do I know what the fellow looks like if he's inside a ship miles in the air?  It's just foolish on its face.
",354,99,6,11,Welles,Fry20531,Fry," If you want the cheese log, you'll read what I wrote.
",55,99,6,11,Welles,Welles20532,Welles," Very well. I shall comply.
",28,99,6,11,Fry,Welles20533,Welles," I'm getting reports that cities across the globe are being destroyed by this noble invader, whose good looks are apparently discernible across vast distances and through solid metal.  But wait, the leader of the attack is swaggering out of his ship and up to a convenient nearby microphone. Now why couldn't I have just described his appearance at this point? This is the type of thing I'm talking about.
Lrrr: People of Earth, I am Lrrr, conqueror of your planet.  Cue screams.  You will now remove your skulls and play dodgeball with them for my amusement.
",560,99,6,11,Welles,Ndnd20534,Ndnd," Ooh! I could swear his horns have gotten longer!
",50,99,6,11,Welles,Kif20535,Kif," Sir, I've intercepted an Earth broadcast.
",43,99,6,11,Ndnd,Zapp20536,Zapp," Put it up on the Zenith.  Oh, God!
Welles:  Earth is conquered, the destruction of civilization complete. Now stay tuned for Little Orphan Annie.
",147,99,6,11,Kif,Zapp20537,Zapp," To hell with Little Orphan Annie! We've got to do something.
",62,99,6,11,Zapp,Lrrr20538,Lrrr," What's that, honey? How many dead? Uh, I don't know, 80 million? Okay. I love you, too.  That was Ndnd, she's taking me back! 
",128,99,6,11,Zapp,Welles20539,Welles," I'm sorry I've been so difficult.
",35,99,6,11,Lrrr,Zapp20540,Zapp," So, you thought you could conquer us so easily, eh? Nice job. We surrender. Earth is yours. 
",94,99,6,11,Welles,Welles20541,Welles," Damn, I'm good. Now, may I please have that cheese log?
",57,99,6,11,Zapp,Zapp20542,Zapp," Oh, glorious conqueror, permit me to offer up a sacrifice.  How 'bout this?
",77,99,6,11,Welles,Kif20543,Kif,"  Hey!
",7,99,6,11,Zapp,Lrrr20544,Lrrr," Yeah, he'll do.
Leela: Come on, Lrrr. Show's over.
",52,99,6,11,Kif,Lrrr20545,Lrrr," Fine, okay. About this conquering thing.  Funny story.
",56,99,6,11,Lrrr,Ndnd20546,Ndnd," Hello, Lrrr.
",14,99,6,11,Lrrr,Leela20547,Leela," Lrrr! Put a stop to this right now!
",37,99,6,11,Ndnd,Lrrr20548,Lrrr," Okay, okay. Quit nagging!
",27,99,6,11,Leela,Ndnd20549,Ndnd," Lrrr, why are you yelling softly with the purple-furred one?
",62,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20550,Lrrr," Uh, it's nothing, my queen. 
",30,99,6,11,Ndnd,Leela20551,Leela," He messed up my hair.
",23,99,6,11,Lrrr,Kif20552,Kif," I'm missing a leg.
",20,99,6,11,Leela,Zapp20553,Zapp," We fought like Hell, sir, but in the end, we caved like a house of soufflÃ© cards.
",83,99,6,11,Kif,Nixon20554,Nixon," Got it. Peace with honor. Well, I resign again.
",49,99,6,11,Zapp,Ndnd20555,Ndnd," Come, Nixon. Introduce me to the kitchen staff. I must lay down the law about Lrrr's low sodium diet. 
",104,99,6,11,Nixon,Leela20556,Leela," You've got to tell her the truth. And lay off the salted peanuts!
",67,99,6,11,Ndnd,Lrrr20557,Lrrr," I'm just trying to get the leg taste out of my mouth.
",55,99,6,11,Leela,Ndnd20558,Ndnd," Lrrr, I'm in here now, not out there!
",39,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20559,Lrrr," Give me a little time. With a lady like Ndnd, one must use finesse.  Coming, giangantums!
",91,99,6,11,Ndnd,Ndnd20560,Ndnd,"  Mmm. That's crisp.
",21,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20561,Lrrr," Yes, but no more so than your squamous dorsal plates in the moonlight.
",72,99,6,11,Ndnd,Ndnd20562,Ndnd,"  I am experiencing arousal. My organs are moving into position. 
",66,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20563,Lrrr," Ndnd, there's something that I've got to tell you.
",52,99,6,11,Ndnd,Ndnd20564,Ndnd," What is it? Is there someone else?
Lrrr: What? No, no, it's about this takeover of Earth. It's... It's...
",107,99,6,11,Lrrr,Ndnd20565,Ndnd," The spark that reignited our marriage?
",40,99,6,11,Ndnd,Lrrr20566,Lrrr," Yes! Exactly. Good night. 
",28,99,6,11,Ndnd,Leela20567,Leela," Oh, lord! Now what?
",21,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20568,Lrrr," I couldn't tell her the truth!
Leela: Look, you scaly crybaby, you'll do what I say and do it now!
",100,99,6,11,Leela,Ndnd20569,Ndnd," I knew it!
",12,99,6,11,Lrrr,Bender20570,Bender,"  Frying pans! Cast-iron frying pans!
",38,99,6,11,Ndnd,Lrrr20571,Lrrr," It's not what it looks like! What do I do?
",44,99,6,11,Bender,Leela20572,Leela," Do what I say. Tell her!
",26,99,6,11,Lrrr,Ndnd20573,Ndnd," Tell me what?  Give me the heavy one. 
",40,99,6,11,Leela,Lrrr20574,Lrrr," The invasion was all a fake. I just wanted to impress you.
",60,99,6,11,Ndnd,Ndnd20575,Ndnd," You lied? What else have you been hiding from me?
",51,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20576,Lrrr," What else? Nothing else.
",26,99,6,11,Ndnd,Grrrl20577,Grrrl," I still want you, Lrrr, and I'm willing to fight for you.
",59,99,6,11,Lrrr,Bender20578,Bender," All I've got left is a colander and a pie pan.
",48,99,6,11,Grrrl,Ndnd20579,Ndnd," Lrrr?
",7,99,6,11,Bender,Lrrr20580,Lrrr," Look, we only had one date. I barely mated with her.
",54,99,6,11,Ndnd,Ndnd20581,Ndnd," Whatever. I harbor no resentment against her.  What I want to know is what is up between you and Bossy Boots here.
",116,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20582,Lrrr," Her? She's just a bossy friend.
",33,99,6,11,Ndnd,Ndnd20583,Ndnd," Exactly! She nagged you, tormented you, and pushed you around. That is my job! This must be settled. I demand the ancient ritual of Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or Consequences!
",170,99,6,11,Lrrr,Fry20584,Fry," Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or what?
",30,99,6,11,Ndnd,Ndnd20585,Ndnd," Let the ritual begin. The rules are the same as in the home version. Lrrr must simply choose between myself and Leela...
",122,99,6,11,Fry,Leela20586,Leela," Fine. Hurry up.
",17,99,6,11,Ndnd,Ndnd20587,Ndnd," By shooting the one he rejects.
",33,99,6,11,Leela,Leela20588,Leela," Lrrr, I'm getting angry. Don't you go through with this.
",58,99,6,11,Ndnd,Ndnd20589,Ndnd," She is not the boss of you! I am the boss of you! 
",52,99,6,11,Leela,Fry20590,Fry," Leela's gonna die. What would Delivery-Boy Man do? 
Lrrr:  I do not want to shoot anybody.
",92,99,6,11,Ndnd,Ndnd20591,Ndnd," You never want to do anything!
",32,99,6,11,Fry,Lrrr20592,Lrrr," Oh, nag, nag, nag.
",20,99,6,11,Ndnd,Ndnd20593,Ndnd," You want me to stop nagging? Then shoot me!
",45,99,6,11,Lrrr,Lrrr20594,Lrrr," Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
",36,99,6,11,Ndnd,Ndnd20595,Ndnd," Beats staring at your fat ass on the couch.

",32,99,6,11,Ndnd,Fry20597,Fry,"  Ray-blocking power! 
",23,99,6,11,Ndnd,Leela20598,Leela," Fry! 
",7,99,6,11,Fry,Ndnd20599,Ndnd," Lrrr, you were willing to shoot that bossy temptress! You really do value my nagging above all others!
",104,99,6,11,Leela,Leela20600,Leela," Good night, dumb prince.
",26,99,6,11,Ndnd,Grrrl20601,Grrrl,"  Come back, Lrrr! I wanna have your Popplers! They'll never be anyone but you!  Hello.
",88,99,6,11,Leela,Zoidberg20602,Zoidberg," Of course I'll marry you!
",27,99,6,11,Grrrl,Amy20603,Amy," Wait, what the Shmell happened? I thought Ndnd disintegrated you with this ray gun.
",85,99,6,11,Zoidberg,Grrrl20604,Grrrl," It's just a cheap teleporter. I bought it off the back of a comic book.
",73,99,6,11,Amy,Farnsworth20605,Farnsworth," Cha-ching!
",12,99,6,11,Grrrl,Leela20606,Leela," The teleporter gun? But that means Fry might still be...
Amy: Fry?
",68,99,6,11,Farnsworth,Zoidberg20607,Zoidberg," Fry?
",6,99,6,11,Leela,Bender20608,Bender,"  Is this him?
",15,99,6,11,Zoidberg,Leela20609,Leela," Fry, you're alive!
",20,99,6,11,Bender,Fry20610,Fry," Not only that, I now know exactly how to end my comic book. Let's watch.
",74,99,6,11,Leela,Invader X20611,Invader X," Say good-bye to your forehead, 'cause I'm gonna shoot you in it!
",66,99,6,11,Fry,Delivery-Boy Man #120612,Delivery-Boy Man #1," Not if I leap in front of your death ray, and I am gonna do that. Jumping sound! Ow! 
",87,99,6,11,Invader X,Invader X20613,Invader X," I didn't shoot yet. As usual, your delivery arrived too soon. 
",64,99,6,11,Delivery-Boy Man #1,Lane20614,Lane," Oh, Delivery-Boy Man! You saved me by random chance.
",54,99,6,11,Invader X,Delivery-Boy Man #120615,Delivery-Boy Man #1," Don't thank random chance. Thank my meteor-wishing power, with your lips. 
",76,99,6,11,Lane,Leela20616,Leela,"  Good ending. Not great.
",26,99,6,11,Delivery-Boy Man #1,Farnsworth20617,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. We've been hired to make our 100th delivery.
",67,100,6,12,Leela,Zoidberg20618,Zoidberg," 100!
",6,100,6,12,Farnsworth,Hermes20619,Hermes," That's almost 10 per year.
",28,100,6,12,Zoidberg,Bender20620,Bender," This calls for a party, baby. I'm ordering a hundred kegs, a hundred hookers, and a hundred Elvis impersonators who aren't above a little hooking, should the occasion arise!
",175,100,6,12,Hermes,Elzar20621,Elzar,"  Be very gentle, folks. This is the soufflÃ© you'll be delivering to Mrs. Astor.
",81,100,6,12,Bender,Bender20622,Bender," Oh my God, it's Elzar! Hi, Elzar! Great soufflÃ©, Elzar!
",57,100,6,12,Elzar,Elzar20623,Elzar," Whatever you do, don't drop it.  See, Mrs. Astor takes nitroglycerine for her heart, and being a class act, she prefers it in soufflÃ© form.   Bam.
",148,100,6,12,Bender,Farnsworth20624,Farnsworth," To prevent the soufflÃ© from exploding, Bender will carry it. He's gyroscopically stable.
",90,100,6,12,Elzar,Farnsworth20625,Farnsworth," Look, Mrs. Astor's mansion, just across that rickety rope bridge. 
",68,100,6,12,Farnsworth,Amy20626,Amy," Wow, it's ricketier than it looks. You'd better try to jump it, Bender.
",73,100,6,12,Farnsworth,Bender20627,Bender," Okay, let me back up for a running start. 
",44,100,6,12,Amy,Hobsy20628,Hobsy,"  I shall inform Mrs. Astor that the circus is in town.
",56,100,6,12,Bender,Hobsy20629,Hobsy," Your soufflÃ©, Madam.
",22,100,6,12,Hobsy,Mrs. Astor20630,Mrs. Astor," I shall take it here, under my fork.
",38,100,6,12,Hobsy,Zoidberg20631,Zoidberg," Where's the exploding?
",24,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Hobsy20632,Hobsy," One does not explode in Mrs. Astor's face.
",44,100,6,12,Zoidberg,Mrs. Astor20633,Mrs. Astor," I couldn't eat another bite. Hobsy?
",37,100,6,12,Hobsy,Mrs. Astor20634,Mrs. Astor," Well done, sir. Have you a name?
",34,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Farnsworth20635,Farnsworth," Hubert Farnsworth, at your service.
",37,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Mrs. Astor20636,Mrs. Astor," A Farnsworth, you say? Well, if I'm not mistaken, the Farnsworths have been in New New York for almost two hundred years.
",123,100,6,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20637,Farnsworth," Yes, I have.
",14,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Fry20638,Fry," And I'm his uncle!
",20,100,6,12,Farnsworth,Mrs. Astor20639,Mrs. Astor," How charmingly unconventional.
",32,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20640,Fry," I can eat a hotdog underwater.
",32,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Mrs. Astor20641,Mrs. Astor," Say, would you Farnsworths care to be my guests tomorrow at the Astor Endowment Fundraiser? All the best families will be there.
",130,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20642,Fry," We can take 'em.
",18,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Mrs. Astor20643,Mrs. Astor,"  On April 10, 2912, my late husband and I set off down Fifth Avenue aboard the Land Titanic, the largest street-going vessel ever built.  Just four days into her maiden voyage, as we approached 32 Street, the line-liner struck a mailbox and went down.   2000 souls were lost that day, including my dear husband. In loving memory, I established the Mr. Astor Endowment, which this year supports the United Mutant Scholarship Fund.
",431,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20644,Fry,"  Mutants? That's the kind of thing you are.
",45,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Leela20645,Leela," Shh. You know mutants aren't allowed on the surface. If anyone asks, say I'm an alien, remember?
",98,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20646,Fry," Right. You gonna finish that roll?
",36,100,6,12,Leela,Leela20647,Leela," Shh.
",6,100,6,12,Fry,Mrs. Astor20648,Mrs. Astor," Now a short film about those pitiable creatures so in need of our charity.
",76,100,6,12,Leela,Narrator20649,Narrator," Far beneath the everyday rumble of limousines and poodle feet, there toil a downtrodden people even less well off than the upper middle class.  The noble sewer mutants. For you see, generations of exposure to toxic sewage mutated them into horrific monsters! 
",261,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Leela20650,Leela," Shut up!
",10,100,6,12,Narrator,Narrator20651,Narrator," These industrious, uh, people, I guess, maintain the various pipes and poop chutes that keep decent, above-ground society functioning.  And where do these proud toileteers learn their menial skills? At Brown University, the nation's premier institution of lower learning. So please, give generously, knowing some poor helpless mutant will thank you. Not in person, thank God!
",377,100,6,12,Leela,Leela20652,Leela," Well, that was disturbing.
",28,100,6,12,Narrator,Mrs. Astor20653,Mrs. Astor," Oh, I understand, dear. They are hideous.
",43,100,6,12,Leela,Leela20654,Leela," Look, I guess you mean well, but isn't that university just a tax-deductible sewer-cleaning service?
",102,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Mrs. Astor20655,Mrs. Astor," My dear, that school is about much more than sewer pipes.
",59,100,6,12,Leela,Leela20656,Leela," Really?
",9,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Mrs. Astor20657,Mrs. Astor," It's also about keeping those filthy things busy. There are thousands of them down there, breeding like rats.
",111,100,6,12,Leela,Royalty girl20658,Royalty girl,"  My great uncle once saw a rat.
",33,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Mrs. Astor20659,Mrs. Astor," If we don't keep them busy, they'll start jabbering on about equal rights in their ill-bred manner.
",101,100,6,12,Royalty girl,Leela20660,Leela," Let's go. If I say one more thing, I might say it with my evening boot.
",73,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Mrs. Astor20661,Mrs. Astor," Well! Rarely have I never!
",28,100,6,12,Leela,Fry20662,Fry," Please, don't blame Leela. She's just a little ill-bred. You know how mutants are.
",84,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Mrs. Astor20663,Mrs. Astor," You companion is a mutant?
",28,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20664,Fry," But if anyone asks, say she's an alien.

",28,100,6,12,Leela,Leela20673,Leela," Oh, Mom, Dad, I can't believe I have to spend the rest of my life in this hellhole.  I'm sorry.
",97,100,6,12,Colonel,Turanga Munda20674,Turanga Munda," It's okay, sweetie. Now that you're here, this hellhole feels more like a nice, regular hole.
",95,100,6,12,Leela,Turanga Morris20675,Turanga Morris," What do ya say we go get some sewer coffee, sewer cake, and Safeway ice cream?
",80,100,6,12,Turanga Munda,Bender20676,Bender,"  Well, the bottom's all stocked with cheap stuff. Who's in the mood to party?  Whoo!
",86,100,6,12,Turanga Morris,Fry20677,Fry," Poor, Leela. I feel like I ruined her life.
",45,100,6,12,Bender,Hermes20678,Hermes," You did ruin her life.
",24,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20679,Fry," You might be right, Hermes.
",29,100,6,12,Hermes,Hermes20680,Hermes," I am right.
",13,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20681,Fry," I almost feel like we should do something to help her.
",56,100,6,12,Hermes,Hermes20682,Hermes," We should do something!
",25,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20683,Fry," I don't care what you say, Hermes. Let's go.
",46,100,6,12,Hermes,Fry20684,Fry," Oh, mighty mayor. We're here about Turanga Leela.
",51,100,6,12,Fry,Poopenmeyer20685,Poopenmeyer," You mean Leela?
",17,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20686,Fry," Right. I mean sure, she's a mutant, we've known that for years. But we kept it a secret because she's a fine, upstanding...
",125,100,6,12,Poopenmeyer,Poopenmeyer20687,Poopenmeyer," Wait. You knowingly attempted to harbor a mutant?
",51,100,6,12,Fry,Hermes20688,Hermes," We did harbor a mutant! Uh-oh.
",32,100,6,12,Poopenmeyer,Munda20689,Munda," Look, Leela, there's Old Filthful. 
",37,100,6,12,Hermes,Leela20690,Leela," Urgh!
",7,100,6,12,Munda,Morris20691,Morris," And there's the West Side Pipeway.  If those guys slack off for even a second, it could explode.  Hey, guys! This is my daughter, Leela.
",138,100,6,12,Leela,Morris20692,Morris," Well, they're with the chuds, now.
",36,100,6,12,Morris,Leela20693,Leela," These conditions are deplorable. I swear, I hate every single person on the surface for making us live like this.
",115,100,6,12,Morris,Fry20694,Fry," Leela!
",8,100,6,12,Leela,Leela20695,Leela," What are you doing here?
",26,100,6,12,Fry,Amy20696,Amy," We were sentence to two weeks in the sewer for harboring a mutant.
",68,100,6,12,Leela,Zoidberg20697,Zoidberg," Three dollars at the drug store.
",34,100,6,12,Amy,Fry20698,Fry," I'm so sorry I ratted you out, but, you know, after two weeks down here, I'll truly understand the plight of the mutant people.
",129,100,6,12,Zoidberg,Leela20699,Leela," How dare you? You wanna understand something? Look at that lake. One dip in that toxic muck and your DNA will be permanently mutated. You'll grow a camel hump or a Zoidberg face.
",180,100,6,12,Fry,Zoidberg20700,Zoidberg," Urgh!
",7,100,6,12,Leela,Leela20701,Leela," You wanna know what it's like to be a mutant? Jump in and go for a swim.
",74,100,6,12,Zoidberg,Fry20702,Fry," I would, but I ate a bunch of potato salad, so...
",51,100,6,12,Leela,Leela20703,Leela," Yeah, that's what I thought. You are all surface.
",51,100,6,12,Fry,Bender20704,Bender," Fry! Hermes! Where my humans are? Ah, who cares? It is on.
",60,100,6,12,Leela,H.G. Blob20705,H.G. Blob," Hey, hey, hey.
",16,100,6,12,Bender,Hedonism Bot20706,Hedonism Bot," I trust the orgy pit has been scraped and buttered?
",53,100,6,12,H.G. Blob,Bender20707,Bender," You know it, and there's mini-quiches, too.
",45,100,6,12,Hedonism Bot,Hermes20708,Hermes," It's getting cold and smelly. My odor-eaters are going critical. 
",67,100,6,12,Bender,Zoidberg20709,Zoidberg," Maybe we can plotz in that giant cockle. 
",43,100,6,12,Hermes,Amy20710,Amy," Shmeepers, it's the Land Titanic, the biggest and onlyest land boat ever constructed...
",89,100,6,12,Zoidberg,Hermes20711,Hermes," This was one hell of a bus.
",29,100,6,12,Amy,Zoidberg20712,Zoidberg," Well, everyone debone a bunk and get some shut-eye. 
",54,100,6,12,Hermes,Farnsworth20713,Farnsworth," Zoidberg, show some respect! This is a sacred shrine to the thousands who lost their lives.
",93,100,6,12,Zoidberg,Amy20714,Amy,"  Hey, I found a safe!
",23,100,6,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20715,Farnsworth," It's coming loose. Hand me some more of that cruise director.  The original passenger manifests. 
",99,100,6,12,Amy,Hermes20716,Hermes," Spreadsheets were so elegant back then.
",41,100,6,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20717,Farnsworth," Just one other item. 
",23,100,6,12,Hermes,Amy20718,Amy," It's jewelry. Jewelry! It's jewelry, people!
",46,100,6,12,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20719,Farnsworth," It's a priceless quantum-force gemerald. 
",43,100,6,12,Amy,Zoidberg20720,Zoidberg," What's that enscribbled on it?
",32,100,6,12,Farnsworth,Hermes20721,Hermes,"  ""My dear Mrs. Astor. My love for you is as unsinkable as this land ship and as brilliant as this stone. Dictated but not read, Mr. Astor.""
",141,100,6,12,Zoidberg,Amy20722,Amy," Aw! That's so valuable.
",25,100,6,12,Hermes,Fry20723,Fry," Yeah, I'll never have love like that. Leela hates me now.   Did you guys know I have a crush on Leela? 
",105,100,6,12,Amy,Munda20724,Munda," What's a matter, Leela? You've hardly touched your toilet clams.
",66,100,6,12,Fry,Leela20725,Leela,"  Maybe I was too harsh on Fry. He didn't ruin my life on purpose.
",67,100,6,12,Munda,Morris20726,Morris," Things will work out, honey. Now here, have some more of what looks like lemonade. 
",85,100,6,12,Leela,Bubblegum20727,Bubblegum," Bender, I've been to wang dang doodles all up and down the galaxy, but this is the dangest wang I ever doodled.
",113,100,6,12,Morris,Bender20728,Bender," Oh, yeah! Come on baby, let's do it.  Shake your booty, baby. Come on, yeah!  Get out! Get out! It's not fun anymore! I wanna be alone!
Hedonism Bot: Alone with me?
",166,100,6,12,Bubblegum,Bender20729,Bender," I said scram, grapey! 
",24,100,6,12,Bender,Leela20730,Leela," Fry? What are you doing.
",26,100,6,12,Bender,Fry20731,Fry,"  You were right. I don't know what it's like to be a mutant. But I want to know.
",82,100,6,12,Leela,Leela20732,Leela," Wait, I never meant for you to...  Oh, no!  Fry! Fry! No! No! 
",64,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20733,Fry," Any effect?
",13,100,6,12,Leela,Leela20734,Leela,"  Sorry. I tried to scream but I barfed.
",41,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20735,Fry," I think I'm knowing what it's like to be a mutant.
",52,100,6,12,Leela,Zoidberg20736,Zoidberg," So, what's with all the screaming?
",36,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20737,Fry," Hey, guys.
",12,100,6,12,Zoidberg,Leela20738,Leela," Fry, this is the stupidest, sweetest thing you've ever done. And you know, maybe now, together, we can be an inspiration to other mutants.
",140,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20739,Fry," I hope so, Leela.
",19,100,6,12,Leela,Leela20740,Leela," Aw. Come here. Let me give you a kiss.  Hug.  Handshake.  I'll text ya.
",73,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20741,Fry," My fellow mutants, until recently, I dwelt on the surface where a man can gaze up at the sky in wonder without a wet clump falling in his mouth.
",146,100,6,12,Leela,Mutant #120742,Mutant #1,"  We can do that too. 
",23,100,6,12,Fry,Leela20743,Leela," Who's ready to fight for equality?  The Devolution Revolution has begun! Beautiful mutants, please welcome Devo!

Dwayne: Play ""Whip It""!
",149,100,6,12,Leela,Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh20745,Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh," No.  Play the other one.
",26,100,6,12,Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh,Leela20746,Leela," Now that we got their attention, it's time to hit them where they sit, by bending the West Side Pipeway to return all sewage to the surface.
",142,100,6,12,Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh,Fry20747,Fry," But who could possibly bend such a huge pipe?
",47,100,6,12,Leela,Bender20748,Bender," So lonely. Poor, sad Bender.
",30,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20749,Fry," Hey, buddy.

",31,100,6,12,Mutant #1s,Sal20753,Sal,"  Yucks. I picked the wrong day to wear my new Crocses.
",56,100,6,12,Fry,Leela20754,Leela," Prepare to storm the surface for the Million Mutant March.
",60,100,6,12,Sal,Colonel20755,Colonel," Move out, Fry. We need out most disgusting mutant leading the charge.
",71,100,6,12,Leela,Fry20756,Fry,"  I'll meet you up there. I need to check out something first.
",63,100,6,12,Colonel,Colonel20757,Colonel," Okay. Vyolet, you're up front.
",32,100,6,12,Fry,Vyolet20758,Vyolet," Hey!
",6,100,6,12,Colonel,Mrs. Astor20759,Mrs. Astor," Mayor, this sewage debacle has gone on long enough. As your largest campaign contributor, I demand action!
",108,100,6,12,Vyolet,Poopenmeyer20760,Poopenmeyer," Very well. $80 worth of action it is.
",39,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Poopenmeyer20761,Poopenmeyer," VoilÃ ! We simply pump the fruits of our excretion into Madison Cube Garden.
",77,100,6,12,Poopenmeyer,Mrs. Astor20762,Mrs. Astor," Well, it seems everything is under... 
",40,100,6,12,Poopenmeyer,Vyolet20763,Vyolet," Two!

",31,100,6,12,Colonel,Leela20767,Leela," The segregation of the mutant people ends today. We demand equal rights, equal access to the surface, and the blood of your first-born children.  That so we have something to give up at the negotiations.
",205,100,6,12,Mutant #1s,Mrs. Astor20768,Mrs. Astor," I've never been so moved, and I see no reason to begin now. Hobsy, flush those creatures back into the hole they crawled out of.

",8,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20772,Fry," Mrs. Astor, deep in the sewers, we discovered the wreck of the Land Titanic, on which your husband land-drowned. Inside was something that might interest you.
",160,100,6,12,Bender,Mrs. Astor20773,Mrs. Astor," The gemerald ring that my husband was to give me in lieu of children.  So what, I have a chandelier in my car made of those.
",126,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20774,Fry," Not the gem. This passenger manifest. It turns out there were mutants on that ship, working below deck in the sewage galley.
",126,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Leelas grandmother20775,Leelas grandmother," I was just a young girl.  Drain angels, they called us. When the ship started going down.  My mother grabbed me and made for the nearest life-car.  But the places were all taken by surface passengers. As my mother held me tight, I suddenly felt the gentle tap of a cane on my face. I turned to see the kindly smile of Mr. Astor.   Thanks to your husband's humanity, I lived to raise my own daughter, and she, a daughter in turn.
",430,100,6,12,Fry,Leela20776,Leela," Mom, why have I never heard this?
",35,100,6,12,Leelas grandmother,Munda20777,Munda,"  My mother's nuts.
",20,100,6,12,Leela,Fry20778,Fry," I beg you, Mrs. Astor, if you truly want to honor your husband's memory, treat these people with dignity, as he did.
",118,100,6,12,Munda,Mrs. Astor20779,Mrs. Astor," Oh, he was a dear man, Mr. Astor.  Randall, let's grant these mutants their freedom.
",86,100,6,12,Fry,Poopenmeyer20780,Poopenmeyer," Okay.
",7,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Dwayne20781,Dwayne," Are we not men now?

",45,100,6,12,Dwayne,Leela20783,Leela," Thank you, Fry. I think maybe I can stomach that kiss now.
",60,100,6,12,Mutated Mark Mothersbaugh,Fry20784,Fry," What the...?
",14,100,6,12,Leela,Mr. Astor20785,Mr. Astor," Good afternoon. I am Mr. Astor. I did not perish that fateful day, but rather plummeted into the toxic lake, where I mutated and lived in solitude until this ruddy lad here stepped into my mouth and lodged there.
",214,100,6,12,Fry,Mrs. Astor20786,Mrs. Astor," Mister? Is that really you? 
",30,100,6,12,Mr. Astor,Zoidberg20787,Zoidberg," Horray! A happy ending for the rich people!
",45,100,6,12,Mrs. Astor,Leela20788,Leela," Mom, Dad, Grandma, this is where I work.
",42,100,6,12,Zoidberg,Munda20789,Munda," Oh! Was there a fire?
",23,100,6,12,Leela,Amy20790,Amy," So, Bender, how was the party?
",32,100,6,12,Munda,Bender20791,Bender," Only the greatest party ever! I don't need to have another party in my whole life. I am partied out!
",102,100,6,12,Amy,Fry20792,Fry," Dang! Sorry we missed it!
",27,100,6,12,Bender,Bender20793,Bender," We could have another one, if it would make you guys feel better.
",67,100,6,12,Fry,Fry20794,Fry," Really? No, that's not necessary.
",35,100,6,12,Bender,Bender20795,Bender," Hit it, Bender!

",59,101,6,13,Transition Announcer #1,Bender20799,Bender," Ooh, I'll have one!
",21,101,6,13,Amy,Amy20800,Amy," Mmm... ""It's NUTSO Good!""
",27,101,6,13,Bender,Fry20801,Fry," Oh.
",5,101,6,13,Amy,Leela20802,Leela," What's wrong, Fry? Are you regretting another wasted year?
",60,101,6,13,Fry,Fry20803,Fry," I don't know. Somethin' about Xmas just doesn't feel like Christmas.
",70,101,6,13,Leela,Farnsworth20804,Farnsworth," Santa's coming! Initiate defenses!
",36,101,6,13,Fry,Robot #1 Santa20805,Robot #1 Santa," God rest ye, merry gentlemen... in peace! 
",44,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Fry20806,Fry," Can someone please explain how you celebrate this crazy holiday? Preferably in song?
",86,101,6,13,Robot #1 Santa,Robot #1 Santa20807,Robot #1 Santa,"  It's the violentest season of the year.
",42,101,6,13,Fry,Elf20808,Elf,"  Old Kringle-bot has come to spread some mugs of Xmas fear.
",61,101,6,13,Robot #1 Santa,Robot #1 Santa20809,Robot #1 Santa,"  Sugar-plummy visions will be dancing in your head
When I cane you from the comfort of my sled.
",97,101,6,13,Elf,Leela20810,Leela,"  On Xmas Eve, we don our gay apparel,
Kevlar vests, asbestos stockings and a barrel.
",86,101,6,13,Robot #1 Santa,Farnsworth20811,Farnsworth,"  And if Grandma's Xmas fruitcake finally reaches critical mass,
It can be regifted straight to Santa's ass.
",109,101,6,13,Leela,Robot #1 Santa20812,Robot #1 Santa,"  But the ornamental armaments are merely superficial,
The tinsel and the trappings are just icing on the missile.
The one thing that you need to make your Xmas day splendiferous
Is a pine tree; a pine tree that's coniferous.
",226,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Planet Express crew20813,Planet Express crew,"  We have to have a pine tree as coniferous.
",45,101,6,13,Robot #1 Santa,Robot #1 Santa20814,Robot #1 Santa," You're welcome.
",17,101,6,13,Planet Express crew,Fry20815,Fry," You know, Santa may have killed Scruffy, but he makes a good point. What we need is an old-fashioned pine tree.
",113,101,6,13,Robot #1 Santa,Farnsworth20816,Farnsworth," Cram it, Virginia! Pine trees have been extinct for over eight hundred years.
",79,101,6,13,Fry,Leela20817,Leela," Professor, maybe there's some way to bring the pine trees back to life, like we did with the barking snakes.
",110,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20818,Farnsworth," Pine trees aren't barking snakes. They won't just turn up in a salad at Olive Garden. But there is one hope, and, as usual, it's Norwegian!
",141,101,6,13,Leela,Farnsworth20819,Farnsworth," Behold! The Svalbard Global Seed Vault! Since 2008, the vault has preserved seeds of every known plant species in case of extinction.
",135,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Hermes20820,Hermes," And I brought a few seeds of my own.
",38,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Norwegian seed guard20821,Norwegian seed guard," Halt! Wh-what's your business poky-pokin' about da seed vault, eh, guardian of mankind's precious botanical heritage dere?
",124,101,6,13,Hermes,Farnsworth20822,Farnsworth," We just wanna come in and rummage about a bit.
",48,101,6,13,Norwegian seed guard,Norwegian seed guard20823,Norwegian seed guard," Oh. So... okay. 
",18,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Bender20824,Bender," Yo, ABBA, what's that next door?
Norwegian seed guard: Oh, dat's da germ warfare repository.
",94,101,6,13,Norwegian seed guard,Leela20825,Leela," It's so close! Is there any chance of cross-contamination?
",60,101,6,13,Bender,Norwegian seed guard20826,Norwegian seed guard," No.
",5,101,6,13,Leela,Norwegian seed guard20827,Norwegian seed guard," Now, your pine trees were all chopped down to make imirgincee toilet paper durin' th' fifty-year squirts. Lucky da seeds have bin preserved here in da vault der.
",163,101,6,13,Norwegian seed guard,Amy20828,Amy," What's that splork on them?  It's not germs, is it?
",53,101,6,13,Norwegian seed guard,Norwegian seed guard20829,Norwegian seed guard," No.
",5,101,6,13,Amy,Fry20830,Fry," Now that's a tree worth chopping down.
",40,101,6,13,Norwegian seed guard,Tinny Tim20831,Tinny Tim," Indeed. 'Tis a loverly tree. 'Twould truly be my finest Xmas eve-
",67,101,6,13,Fry,Nixon20832,Nixon," Araroo!
",9,101,6,13,Tinny Tim,Nixon20833,Nixon," That's what my poll numbers need: Happy voters enjoying some holiday cheer.
",77,101,6,13,Nixon,Cheney20834,Cheney," As your Vice President, I order you to steal that tree.
",57,101,6,13,Nixon,Nixon20835,Nixon," My fellow Earthicans, welcome to the Annual White House Xmas Tree Lighting, brought to you by Gunderson's Nuts!
",113,101,6,13,Cheney,Amy20836,Amy," Oh, no! Could the seed have been contaminated by a virus from the germ vault?
",79,101,6,13,Nixon,Norwegian seed guard20837,Norwegian seed guard," Oh, yeh, I suppose.
",21,101,6,13,Amy,Leela20838,Leela," Wait, this could be a good thing. That weaponized virus made the sickly little tree grow big and strong.
",106,101,6,13,Norwegian seed guard,Leela20839,Leela," Wait, this could be a good thing. Reforestation has begun.
",60,101,6,13,Leela,Bender20840,Bender," Aw, jeez with this, hey?
",26,101,6,13,Leela,Leela20841,Leela," Arguably, this could be a good thing. The planet has returned to its primeval state.
",86,101,6,13,Bender,Fry20842,Fry," Earth is just the way it was before the white man came!
",57,101,6,13,Leela,Farnsworth20843,Farnsworth," Good news! All these pine trees are fighting global warming by producing oxygen. Happy now, Gore?
",99,101,6,13,Fry,Gore20844,Gore," Yeah, but I'd be happier if I had a set of lungs.
",51,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20845,Farnsworth," Wait a second! Oxygen levels are rising too rapidly! 10%... 20% ...60%!
",73,101,6,13,Gore,Gore20846,Gore," As long as it doesn't hit 70!
",31,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20847,Farnsworth," 80%!
",6,101,6,13,Gore,Bender20848,Bender," Y'know, I don't recall having done anything for a while. But I still feel like I deserve a smoke.  Hey, cool, the air's on fire.
",130,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Robot #1 Santa20849,Robot #1 Santa," Ho ho ho! Everyone's dead!  Stay tuned for another tale of holiday hilarity!
",78,101,6,13,Bender,Transition Announcer #120850,Transition Announcer #1," Now, back to...
",17,101,6,13,Robot #1 Santa,Transition Announcer #120851,Transition Announcer #1," ...the Gunderson's Nuts Holiday Spectacular featuring Futurama!
",65,101,6,13,Transition Announcer #1,Farnsworth20852,Farnsworth," Okay, crew. Xmas break is over. It's time to destroy these gifts we forgot to deliver.
",88,101,6,13,Transition Announcer #1,Bender20853,Bender," Woah, woah, woah! How come we get off for every dumb human holiday but not for robot holidays?
",96,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Leela20854,Leela," Oh, Lord, not Robanukah.
",26,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20855,Bender," I'm talkin' about Robanukah, the holiest six and a half weeks in the robot calendar!
",86,101,6,13,Leela,Amy20856,Amy," Pfft! That's just a fake holiday you make up every year to get out of work.
",77,101,6,13,Bender,Fry20857,Fry," Yeah, if it's real, how come there's no song that explains how you celebrate it?
",82,101,6,13,Amy,Bender20858,Bender," Because there is! Hit it!
",27,101,6,13,Fry,Farnsworth20859,Farnsworth," Hit what?
",11,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20860,Bender," I've placed instruments under your seats. Play 'em or I'll break 'em over your heads!
",87,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Bender20861,Bender,"  Robanukah may sound as if it's Jewish,
But its ancient sounding customs are exceptionally newish.
So take a hearty swallow from your robo-kiddish cup,
Which will give me time to quickly make them up.
",202,101,6,13,Bender,Hermes20862,Hermes,"  Do you spin a dreidel made from clay?
",40,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20863,Bender,"  Mine is called a droidel and it's rigged to make you pay.
",60,101,6,13,Hermes,Amy20864,Amy,"  Do you eat these dummy tin-wrapped chocolate coins?
",54,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20865,Bender," Better!  We got fembots with illegal five-speed groins!  Shalom, Ruth and Esther!
",83,101,6,13,Amy,Ruth20866,Ruth," Why with the music so loud?
",29,101,6,13,Bender,Esther20867,Esther," Would it kill him to turn up the heat a little in here?
",57,101,6,13,Ruth,Bender20868,Bender,"  But by far the most important thing is oil.
",46,101,6,13,Esther,Leela20869,Leela,"  To keep the lamp light burning or to help the latkes broil?
",62,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20870,Bender,"  No, we pour the holy lubricant out from the sacred vessel
Into this blessed pit so they can wrestle.
",103,101,6,13,Leela,Planet Express crew20871,Planet Express crew,"  The extra made-up touch that makes Robanukah so special
Is the oil in which the nasty fembots wrestle.
",105,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20872,Bender," We shall now begin the traditional oil wrestling. Will the referee bring out the ceremonial crudes of petroleum oil?  Thank you, Abraham. 
",140,101,6,13,Planet Express crew,Ruth20873,Ruth," Not in the hair, please. I just had it did.
",45,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20874,Bender," Aw, no! These broads are s'posed to wrestle for six and a half weeks! But there's only enough petroleum oil for four and a half weeks!
",136,101,6,13,Ruth,Esther20875,Esther," We're still gettin' paid, right?
",34,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20876,Bender," I told you it's an audition!
",30,101,6,13,Esther,Leela20877,Leela," Bender, four and a half weeks of oil wrestling sounds like plenty.
",68,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20878,Bender," This isn't a lousy reform Robanukah! We need more petroleum oil!
",66,101,6,13,Leela,Hoschel20879,Hoschel," I got me some whale oil, some squirrel oilâ€”
",45,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20880,Bender," Not kosher! It has to be petroleum oil! Do you not give a damn about the hallowed traditions of Robanukah?!
",109,101,6,13,Hoschel,Hoschel20881,Hoschel," I reckon I do not. Anyways, Earth done run out of petroleum oil.
",66,101,6,13,Bender,Gore20882,Gore," I tried to warn you.  One unit of free limitless solar power please.
",70,101,6,13,Hoschel,Hoschel20883,Hoschel," That'll be... I dunno... ten bucks?
",37,101,6,13,Gore,Gore20884,Gore," Um, can you make change for a Nobel Prize?
",44,101,6,13,Hoschel,Bender20885,Bender," Aw, man! Can't we just make more petroleum oil?
",49,101,6,13,Gore,Farnsworth20886,Farnsworth," I'm afraid not, son.  Petroleum only forms when organic matter is subjected to intense pressure for hundreds of millions of years.
",132,101,6,13,Bender,Fry20887,Fry," I can't wait that long! I've got ADD!
",39,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Bender20888,Bender," This is so unfair!
",20,101,6,13,Fry,Ruth20889,Ruth," I don't wrestle dry, Bender. I went to Vassar.
",48,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20890,Bender," Professor, I want you to look these poor floozies in the eye and tell them their oil wrestling days are over.
",111,101,6,13,Ruth,Farnsworth20891,Farnsworth,"  I suppose there could be a minute quantity of petroleum left. But it would be insanely deep within the Earth, at pressures so dangerously high thatâ€”
",151,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20892,Bender," Let's go already!
",19,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Leela20893,Leela," Setting Bachman turners to overdrive.
",39,101,6,13,Bender,Hermes20894,Hermes," We're getting pretty deep.  Look! Mole coffins!
",49,101,6,13,Leela,Amy20895,Amy," Oh, no! We tunneled into a tunnel!
",36,101,6,13,Hermes,Zoidberg20896,Zoidberg," What's that loud, boring sound you'll hear when I stop talking? 
",66,101,6,13,Amy,Farnsworth20897,Farnsworth,"  It's an albino humping worm!
",31,101,6,13,Zoidberg,Fry20898,Fry," Why do they call it that? 
",28,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20899,Farnsworth," Because it doesn't have any pigment.
",38,101,6,13,Fry,Farnsworth20900,Farnsworth," What's our depth, Captain?
",28,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Leela20901,Leela," Forty kilometers. Fifty!
",26,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Bender20902,Bender," There must be petroleum oil down here somewhere. Go deeper! Deeper!
",69,101,6,13,Leela,Farnsworth20903,Farnsworth," No, Bender! The ship can't withstand this much pressure! Sometimes it falls apart just sitting in the hangar!
",111,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20904,Bender," Professor, I've never asked for anything before, but seeing those fembots glistening with oil means more to me than life itself.
",130,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Farnsworth20905,Farnsworth,"  Oh, call me an old fool, but I believe the Lord is speaking through you.  Brace yourselves, everyone!
",104,101,6,13,Bender,Leela20906,Leela," One hundred kilometers! Two hundred!
",38,101,6,13,Farnsworth,Amy20907,Amy," I hate to complain about the heat, but the air conditioner is on fire!
",72,101,6,13,Leela,Hermes20908,Hermes,"  My ice cream manwich!
",24,101,6,13,Amy,Leela20909,Leela," What the hell are we doing? We're all gonna die so this ""junkyard Golem"" can celebrate Robanukah.
",99,101,6,13,Hermes,Bender20910,Bender," You vile racist! Haven't my people suffered enough? Now keep drilling for that petroleum oil, you selfish cowards! Although, then again, I guess any kind of oil would be just as-
",180,101,6,13,Leela,Everybody else20911,Everybody else," Aah! 
",7,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20912,Bender,"  Not my fault.
",16,101,6,13,Everybody else,Bender20913,Bender," I am so great! Bender is great! Bender, Bender, Bender--  Man, where'd the time go?  Hey, you guys wannaâ€” Oh. Right.  They turned into petroleum oil! I thought they were selfish, yet in the end it turned out it was I who thought they were selfish!
",249,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20914,Bender," Doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-Doo, DOO!
",57,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20915,Bender," Hey, ladies, I found some... What theâ€”?  There was only enough petroleum for four and a half weeks of oil wrestling. But it lasted 500 million years! It's a miracle!
",167,101,6,13,Bender,Bender20916,Bender," Happy Robanukah, everyone! Coming up next, more thoughtful, interfaith hijinx!
",80,101,6,13,Bender,Transition Announcer #120917,Transition Announcer #1," And now, the unrelated conclusion.
",36,101,6,13,Bender,Leela20918,Leela," LaBarbara, Hermes, happy Kwanzaa. We brought a chocolate cake. But now I'm worried that might be offensive in some way.
",121,101,6,13,Transition Announcer #1,Labarbara20919,Labarbara," Just sit down.
Bubblegum: Happy Kwanzaa, brother men and sister men.
",70,101,6,13,Leela,Hermes20920,Hermes," Well, look at the cat the cat dragged in.
",43,101,6,13,Labarbara,Bubblegum20921,Bubblegum," Kwanzaa tradition encourages educational gifts. So I brought Dwight my book on Mathketball. 
",94,101,6,13,Hermes,Dwight20922,Dwight," Woah! Let me see that. 
",25,101,6,13,Bubblegum,Bubblegum20923,Bubblegum," I'll sign it for you later.
",29,101,6,13,Dwight,Barbados20924,Barbados," Mon, it's a cold one out there.
",33,101,6,13,Bubblegum,Hermes20925,Hermes," Barbados Slim?
",16,101,6,13,Barbados,Labarbara20926,Labarbara," Come in, Barbados. Look at yourself, all throbbing and shirtless for the holiday. I hope you're ready to celebrate.
",117,101,6,13,Hermes,Barbados20927,Barbados," All night long, woman. 
",25,101,6,13,Labarbara,Hermes20928,Hermes," I'm glad you all could be here with my family. Kwanzaa traditions are quite ancient, dating back over 1,000 years.
",116,101,6,13,Barbados,Fry20929,Fry," Woah!
",7,101,6,13,Hermes,Zoidberg20930,Zoidberg," If only someone could tell us more about these traditions. 
",61,101,6,13,Fry,Kwanzaabot20931,Kwanzaabot," Oh, yeah!
",11,101,6,13,Zoidberg,Dwight20932,Dwight," Hey, Kool-Aid's here.
",23,101,6,13,Kwanzaabot,Labarbara20933,Labarbara," No, child. That's not a made-up character. It's Kwanzaa-bot.
",62,101,6,13,Dwight,Kwanzaabot20934,Kwanzaabot," And I'm gonna tell you all how we celebrate Kwanzaa. Zoidberg, lay down a beat.
",81,101,6,13,Labarbara,Zoidberg20935,Zoidberg," How about I just lay down?
",28,101,6,13,Kwanzaabot,Kwanzaabot20936,Kwanzaabot," The seven basic principles that go to make up Kwanzaa!
",56,101,6,13,Zoidberg,Labarbara20937,Labarbara," Kujichagulia...

",22,101,6,13,Fry,Farnsworth20967,Farnsworth," To communicate with the bees, we'll need to use these trans-bumbalators. Bender, say something in bee talk.

",24,101,6,13,Queen,Farnsworth20979,Farnsworth," They're all infected, just like the bees on Earth.
",52,101,6,13,Zoidberg,Queen20980,Queen," Brother-sucking parasites gone and disrupted our hivemind. Now, instead of working in harmony, my bees just talk smack to each other.

",69,101,6,13,Bee #1 #4,Hermes20987,Hermes," No, we're not going anywhere. I can't abide all this bee-on-bee conflict. It's time to African-Americanize these honeybees. Listen up, bees. It's Kwanzaa, a time of Umoja.

",28,102,6,14,Clamps,Fry21111,Fry," Hey, Francis.
",15,102,6,14,Hermes,Farnsworth21112,Farnsworth," Hello, Francis.
",17,102,6,14,Fry,Leela21113,Leela," Hello.
",8,102,6,14,Farnsworth,Amy21114,Amy," Cute name.
",12,102,6,14,Leela,Hermes21115,Hermes," Look what he can do.
",22,102,6,14,Amy,Clamps21116,Clamps," Yeah, I do it all. Clampin', crimpin', occasional snippin'.
",61,102,6,14,Hermes,Farnsworth21117,Farnsworth," Snipping?  Looks like you may be out of a job, Zoidberg.
",58,102,6,14,Clamps,Zoidberg21118,Zoidberg," That's all good fun. But, of course, a clamp is no substitute for the precision of a genuineâ€”
",95,102,6,14,Farnsworth,Amy21119,Amy," Francis, would you do the honours?
",36,102,6,14,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21120,Zoidberg,"  Stay off my turf!
",20,102,6,14,Amy,Clamps21121,Clamps," Eesh.  That guy can bite my shiny metal clamps.
",49,102,6,14,Zoidberg,Fry21122,Fry,"  You remind me of my old friend Bender.
",41,102,6,14,Clamps,Clamps21123,Clamps," Oh, yeah? Where does he safely live?
",38,102,6,14,Fry,Fry21124,Fry," I dunno. Hey, you wanna come to my house and play?
",52,102,6,14,Clamps,Clamps21125,Clamps," Yeah. Sounds like freakin' fun.
",33,102,6,14,Fry,Clamps21126,Clamps," Four stinkin' years of clampin' school for this?
",50,102,6,14,Clamps,Zoidberg21127,Zoidberg,"  Greetings, Francis.  Sorry if I was a little hostile before, but snipping is the only reason I'm even tolerated around here. Not like you, with those magnificent squeezers!
",175,102,6,14,Clamps,Clamps21128,Clamps," Squeezers? Squeezers?!  They're clamps, you !  And if I wanna -in' snip with these clamps, I will snip with these -ing clamps!  Why do you think they call meâ€”  Francis?
",170,102,6,14,Zoidberg,Farnsworth21129,Farnsworth," Eh, Francis, I have good news. It's time for your first delivery...  To the Moon!
",83,102,6,14,Clamps,Clamps21130,Clamps," Fan--in'-tastic!
",18,102,6,14,Farnsworth,Fry21131,Fry," Here's the two-hundred feet of rope you ordered, Sheriff Burley.
",66,102,6,14,Clamps,Sheriff Burley21132,Sheriff Burley," Hot diggety! You fellas wanna stick around for the hangin' tomorrow? It's gonna be a doozy.  I sure do love hangin' people.  Well, best start cuttin' the nooses.
",163,102,6,14,Fry,Leela21133,Leela," Oh! You know who could help with that?!  Francis!
",51,102,6,14,Sheriff Burley,Leela21134,Leela," Nice job, Francis! I liked how you didn't get drunk and steal anyone's organs. Like our old Robotâ€”
",100,102,6,14,Leela,Fry21135,Fry," Bender?!  Bender! It's me, Fry!
",33,102,6,14,Leela,Donbot21136,Donbot,"  I knew Bender would turn up purely by coincidence. Take care of 'im, but do it quietly.
",90,102,6,14,Fry,Clamps21137,Clamps," Don't worry. We're in space. Where no one can hear you clamp!
",63,102,6,14,Donbot,Hermes21138,Hermes," What do you know? The Feds gave Bender a new identity as a Moon farmer.
",73,102,6,14,Clamps,Fry21139,Fry," Well, he must be afraid to break character in case there's any Robot Mafia scuzzballs around.
",95,102,6,14,Hermes,Clamps21140,Clamps," Huh?
",6,102,6,14,Fry,Amy21141,Amy," Come on! Let's go check on 'im!
",33,102,6,14,Clamps,Clamps21142,Clamps,"  I checked on a guy once.  I checked 'im into tiny pieces!
",60,102,6,14,Amy,Hydroponic Farmer21143,Hydroponic Farmer," Bender?! Nope, don't recollect nobody by that name. But let me ask my son-in-law.   Billy!
",92,102,6,14,Clamps,Bender21144,Bender," Yes, Moon pa?
",15,102,6,14,Hydroponic Farmer,Hydroponic Farmer21145,Hydroponic Farmer," These nice, big-city hillbillies are lookin' for someone named Bender. You know 'im?
",86,102,6,14,Bender,Bender21146,Bender," No, he ain't any of the eight people I ever met.
",50,102,6,14,Hydroponic Farmer,Fry21147,Fry," Bender, it's us, your friends. You can drop the hillbilling moron act.
",72,102,6,14,Bender,Bender21148,Bender," Sorry, mister, but I'm no Bender. I'm just a simple farmer. Name's Billy West!
",80,102,6,14,Fry,Fry21149,Fry," Billy West. What a stupid, phony, made-up name!
",49,102,6,14,Bender,Hydroponic Farmer21150,Hydroponic Farmer," You city folk are probably hungry from premarital sex and flag burnin'. Y'all wanna stay for supper?
",102,102,6,14,Fry,Amy21151,Amy," Well...  My boyfriend and I were gonna have sex on a burning flag, but...  I could have a bite.
",97,102,6,14,Hydroponic Farmer,Billy West21152,Billy West," May I present my beautiful Robot wife, the Crushinator. She's servin' up the dinner and the charm.
",100,102,6,14,Amy,Crushinator21153,Crushinator," Mashed chicken, Mr. Fry?
",26,102,6,14,Billy West,Fry21154,Fry," Sure!
",7,102,6,14,Crushinator,Clamps21155,Clamps," So, uh... Billy... Where were you born?
",41,102,6,14,Fry,Billy West21156,Billy West," Right here in Moon country!
",29,102,6,14,Clamps,Farnsworth21157,Farnsworth," And how long have you been a farmer?
",38,102,6,14,Billy West,Billy West21158,Billy West," Reckon I was born a farmer. Folks say my momma was a hoe.
",59,102,6,14,Farnsworth,Leela21159,Leela," Oh, dear! I seem to have warped my fork!  Could you bend it back for me? Billy?
",81,102,6,14,Billy West,Billy West21160,Billy West," Bend it?  I can't even lift it. Which is weird... Seein' as how my daddy was a forklift.
",90,102,6,14,Leela,Leela21161,Leela,"  Wow! Bender is really committed to his new Jethrovian identity!
",66,102,6,14,Billy West,Billy West21162,Billy West," If y'all are all finished, I'll drive y'all back to town in the old clunker.
",78,102,6,14,Leela,Billy West21163,Billy West," So... Y'all flew here in a spacey-ship?
",41,102,6,14,Billy West,Hermes21164,Hermes," Stop talking like that! You live on the Moon!
",47,102,6,14,Billy West,Fry21165,Fry,"  If that is Bender, I guess he's just happier in his new life.
",64,102,6,14,Hermes,Farnsworth21166,Farnsworth," I refuse to believe anyone is happy! Mr. West, would you mind if I examined your brain?
",89,102,6,14,Fry,Billy West21167,Billy West," Examine? Heck. If you can find it, you can keep it.
",53,102,6,14,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21168,Farnsworth," Gadzooks!  Bender's hard drive no longer contains any of his old memories. When the Feds bumpkinised him, they completely wiped out his old identity!
",151,102,6,14,Billy West,Billy West21169,Billy West," Well, I don't know about that. But who am I to argue with a man from the sky!  So long, space heroes!
",103,102,6,14,Farnsworth,Fry21170,Fry,"  You sure you don't wanna kill all Humans?
",44,102,6,14,Billy West,Billy West21171,Billy West," Pfff! I love all Humans!
",26,102,6,14,Fry,Fry21172,Fry," He really is gone.
",20,102,6,14,Billy West,Fry21173,Fry,"  I guess I'm happy for 'im. And, honestly, Francis is a way better friend than Bender ever was.  Hey, where is Francis?
",121,102,6,14,Fry,Billy West21174,Billy West," One sasparoil, Sheriff! I'm thirsty!
",38,102,6,14,Fry,Sheriff Burley21175,Sheriff Burley," Make it two. I'm greedy.
",26,102,6,14,Billy West,Clamps21176,Clamps," You got the rest fooled.  But not me.  Now let's take this outside so's no one else gets clamped.
",99,102,6,14,Sheriff Burley,Billy West21177,Billy West," You're the boss, stranger!
",28,102,6,14,Clamps,Clamps21178,Clamps," I'm gonna clamp your body parts off one by one. But, then, I'm gonna clamp your wounds shut so ya stay alive... While I clamp ya some more. Say your prayers, stoolie.
",168,102,6,14,Billy West,Billy West21179,Billy West," Okay!  God bless grandma and grandpaâ€”
",39,102,6,14,Clamps,Clamps21180,Clamps," They're next! Right now, I'm gonna cut your damn head off!
",60,102,6,14,Billy West,Zoidberg21181,Zoidberg,"  Drop the Robut.  I thought I told you. I do the cutting around here.
",71,102,6,14,Clamps,Clamps21182,Clamps," Scuttle on home.  This ain't none of your business, Slick.
",60,102,6,14,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21183,Zoidberg," My name isn't Slick. It's Zoidberg.   John -ing Zoidberg!
",59,102,6,14,Clamps,Fry21184,Fry," Stop, Zoidberg!  You'll hurt Francis!
",39,102,6,14,Zoidberg,Clamps21185,Clamps," Oh, yeah? Take this! That that!
",33,102,6,14,Fry,Zoidberg21186,Zoidberg,"  Oy!
",6,102,6,14,Clamps,Clamps21187,Clamps," Why, you lousyâ€”  I'm gonna clamp ya!
",38,102,6,14,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21188,Zoidberg,"  Oy!  Ow. Ow. Ow.
",19,102,6,14,Clamps,Clamps21189,Clamps," Looks like an all-you-can-kill lobster fest.
",46,102,6,14,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21190,Zoidberg," That offer was for a limited time only.
",41,102,6,14,Clamps,Clamps21191,Clamps,"  My clamps!
",13,102,6,14,Zoidberg,Fry21192,Fry," Why, Zoidberg?! Why?!
",23,102,6,14,Clamps,Zoidberg21193,Zoidberg," Because our friend Francis here is in reality... A bad murderer.
",66,102,6,14,Fry,Billy West21194,Billy West," Yup. He was fixin' to kill me.  This here crawdad done saved my life!
",71,102,6,14,Zoidberg,Bella21195,Bella," Bender, you two-timing jerk!  I put off my singing career for you! And, if I can't have you,  no one can!
",107,102,6,14,Billy West,Billy West21196,Billy West," Aw, shucks.
",13,102,6,14,Bella,Fry21197,Fry," Bender!
",9,102,6,14,Billy West,Leela21198,Leela," No!
",5,102,6,14,Fry,Hermes21199,Hermes," What?
",7,102,6,14,Leela,Donbot21200,Donbot," Bender was a helluva squealer.  Maybe the best there ever was. We'll send his widow some meatballs. Clamps, Bella, get in the way-back.
",137,102,6,14,Hermes,Fry21201,Fry," To my friend Bender. A wise man once said he was a helluva squealer.  Maybe the best there ever was.
",102,102,6,14,Donbot,All21202,All," To Bender!
",12,102,6,14,Fry,Bender21203,Bender,"  You pizzas gonna be another minute.  We are still waitin' for it to be delivered.
",84,102,6,14,All,Fry21204,Fry," Bender?!
",10,102,6,14,Bender,Bender21205,Bender,"  I'm no Bender. You got me mixed up with another Robot.
",57,102,6,14,Fry,Fry21206,Fry,"  You're probably right.  I don't really remember what he looks like.
",70,102,6,14,Bender,Bender21207,Bender," Guys! Guys! It's me, Bender!
",30,102,6,14,Fry,Fry21208,Fry,"  He's alive!
",14,102,6,14,Bender,Leela21209,Leela,"  So that Moon hillbilly who got murdered was just an innocent husband and father!
",83,102,6,14,Fry,Farnsworth21210,Farnsworth," Bender, old bot, the Mafia thinks you're dead! You can come back to work with us!
",83,102,6,14,Leela,Bender21211,Bender," I'm back, baby!
",17,102,6,14,Farnsworth,Brown-haired man21212,Brown-haired man," Pizza's here.
",15,102,6,14,Bender,Bender21213,Bender," Woo!  I'll just cut that.
",27,102,6,14,Brown-haired man,Zoidberg21214,Zoidberg," You do and I'll -ing gut you like a fish!
",43,102,6,14,Bender,Leela21215,Leela," Where's the Professor?
",24,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Bender21216,Bender," Eh, probably dead. Already dissolving in a bathtub if we're lucky.
",68,103,6,15,Leela,Farnsworth21217,Farnsworth," I was out on the widow's walk keeping a hopeless vigil for the return of my first delivery crew.  It's been fifty years since they disappeared.
",145,103,6,15,Bender,Fry21218,Fry," Huh. I knew you had other crews, but you never told us you had a first crew.
",78,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21219,Farnsworth," I remember it like it was interesting.
",40,103,6,15,Fry,Farnsworth21220,Farnsworth,"  I had just built my new shipping and receiving emporium.
",59,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21221,Farnsworth,"  And I scoured the hardware-store parking lot to assemble the finest crew imaginable.
",87,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21222,Farnsworth,"  There was Candy, the raunchy by-the-books navigator...  Lifter, the devastatingly handsome forklift...  And Captain Lando Tucker, a dedicated young man with no characteristics.
",179,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Lando Tucker21223,Lando Tucker," We'll deliver that package or die trying.
",43,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Zoidberg21224,Zoidberg," Eh! It's all my favourite patients. And also Captain Tucker. Pow!
",67,103,6,15,Lando Tucker,Candy21225,Candy," Whoa!
",7,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Lando Tucker21226,Lando Tucker," You totally got me, Dr. John.  You're hilarious.
",50,103,6,15,Candy,Hermes21227,Hermes," Zoidberg was popular?!
",24,103,6,15,Lando Tucker,Amy21228,Amy," Zoidberg had hair?!
",21,103,6,15,Hermes,Farnsworth21229,Farnsworth," I never said he had hair!  If you chose to imagine 'im that way, that's your business.  Anyway...
",99,103,6,15,Amy,Farnsworth21230,Farnsworth,"  The time came for our first delivery.
",40,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Young woman21231,Young woman," Lando, don't forget about me and Junior.
",42,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Lando Tucker21232,Lando Tucker," I won't, honey.  Or die trying.
",33,103,6,15,Young woman,Farnsworth21233,Farnsworth," Well, crew, this is it. That cookie bouquet isn't going to deliver itself.
",76,103,6,15,Lando Tucker,Farnsworth21234,Farnsworth,"  Ten...
",9,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21235,Farnsworth,"  Nine and so on. Three...  Two...  One.
",41,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Scientist21236,Scientist," Go, you big metal bird! Get up there!
",39,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Hermes21237,Hermes," Incredible!  Zoidberg had friends?!
",37,103,6,15,Scientist,Zoidberg21238,Zoidberg," It was a different time.
",26,103,6,15,Hermes,Farnsworth21239,Farnsworth,"  Everything was going smoothly until right after that part I was just telling you about.  Suddenly, Amanda's aunt called to say her niece hadn't received her cookie bouquet.
",175,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Farnsworth21240,Farnsworth,"  I watched the skies for weeks. With only occasional breaks to tender my grief diarrhea.
",90,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21241,Farnsworth,"  Just when all hope was lost...
",33,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21242,Farnsworth," The ship's escape pod!  What happened up there, Johnny?
",57,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Zoidberg21243,Zoidberg," Aw! Don't make me remember! So horrible, it was.
",50,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Amy21244,Amy," I thought you said he didn't have hair.
",41,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Farnsworth21245,Farnsworth," Yes, but something he saw on that mission traumatised 'im so severely, he grew hair!  Just so it could turn white! Sadly, my brave crew was gone forever.
",155,103,6,15,Amy,Leela21246,Leela," That poor, incompetent crew.  What do you think happened, Professor?
",70,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21247,Farnsworth," They were lost in the Bermuda Tetrahedron!
",44,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21248,Leela," That's ridiculous.  The Bermuda Tetrahedron is just a myth.
",61,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21249,Farnsworth," I'm glad you're so brave in the face of the unknown, Leela.  Because, for your next mission, you'll be flying directly through...  The Bermuda Tetrahedron!
",157,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21250,Leela," Or we could fly around it.
",28,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21251,Farnsworth," Of course you could! You'd be stupid not to.
",46,103,6,15,Leela,Bender21252,Bender," Supposing we're not stupid, what kinda stupid mission is this?!
",65,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21253,Farnsworth," You'll be picking up a monument commemorating my lost crew.  To be unveiled Tuesday at their memorial ceremony. All the grieving families will be there.  Plus, a popsicle cart!
",178,103,6,15,Bender,Leela21254,Leela," You can count on us, Professor. We'll get that monument here in time.
",71,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Bender21255,Bender," Hooray!
",9,103,6,15,Leela,Amy21256,Amy," Woohoo!
",9,103,6,15,Bender,Bender21257,Bender," Yeah!
",7,103,6,15,Amy,Leela21258,Leela," Or die trying.
",16,103,6,15,Bender,Zoidberg21259,Zoidberg," We're gonna tryâ€” What?
",24,103,6,15,Leela,Green Alien21260,Green Alien," 'Ere you go. ""In memory of the 1st Planet Express ship and it's crew"".
",72,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Leela21261,Leela," Hang on.  It's shouldn't have an apostrophe. This means and it is crew. What the hell's wrong with you?!
",106,103,6,15,Green Alien,Green Alien21262,Green Alien," It's a minor error, lady. I mean, we're space Aliens.  It's a miracle we can even speak English.
",98,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21263,Leela," The miracle is that I'm not kickin' your ass!  I insist you recarve the entire statue correctly.
",98,103,6,15,Green Alien,Green Alien21264,Green Alien," Okay. Okay.  Hey, Charlie! Hack off another block of ivory!
",61,103,6,15,Leela,Amy21265,Amy,"  Well, the statue's perfect now.
",34,103,6,15,Green Alien,Amy21266,Amy," Too bad we won't make it back in time for the memorial service.
Leela: We'll make it. Or die trying.
",102,103,6,15,Amy,Fry21267,Fry," Whoa!
",7,103,6,15,Amy,Leela21268,Leela," We're cutting through the Bermuda Tetrahedron.
",48,103,6,15,Fry,Bender21269,Bender," Woo!  Wait. The Bermuda Tetrahedron?
",38,103,6,15,Leela,Zoidberg21270,Zoidberg," Aw... I think I'm remembering that thing I forgot.
",52,103,6,15,Bender,Amy21271,Amy," Uh-oh. The dials are terrified!
",33,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Leela21272,Leela," Brace yourselves. It's Tickle Me Elmo's fire!
",47,103,6,15,Amy,Bender21273,Bender," Ow.
",5,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21274,Leela," There. See? It was no big thing.
",34,103,6,15,Bender,Hermes21275,Hermes," What was that big thing?
",26,103,6,15,Leela,Fry21276,Fry,"  It's a spaceship graveyard.   Why did we have to come 'ere at night?
",71,103,6,15,Hermes,Hermes21277,Hermes," Look at all these famous lost ships.  There's the Garmin.  And the TomTom.
",76,103,6,15,Fry,Leela21278,Leela," Over there! It's the original Planet Express ship!
",52,103,6,15,Hermes,Amy21279,Amy,"  What caused all that damage?
",31,103,6,15,Leela,Amy21280,Amy," Could it've been flavour-blasted?
",35,103,6,15,Amy,Leela21281,Leela," We'd better investigate.  Looks like an Ion Storm, though.  Everyone suit up!
",79,103,6,15,Amy,Leela21282,Leela," Whatever happened here, that first crew left in a hurry.  The table is still set from McDonald's value dinner!
",112,103,6,15,Leela,Zoidberg21283,Zoidberg," I remember. I remember!  This is what traumatised me. Such a meal to got to waste!  And, with that...  I have closure.
",120,103,6,15,Leela,Amy21284,Amy," Hey, Zoidberg. You're cockatieling.
",37,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21285,Zoidberg," Oh, no.  Something's happening!  What's happening?!
",53,103,6,15,Amy,Zoidberg21286,Zoidberg," Oh, right! And there was a giant killer space whale.
",54,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Bender21287,Bender," Holy crap!  It's a giant space fish!
",38,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Leela21288,Leela," Actually, the space whale isn't a space fish.  It's a space mammal.
",69,103,6,15,Bender,Bender21289,Bender," Wow, interesting. I'm both impressed and being eaten.
",55,103,6,15,Leela,Hermes21290,Hermes," Spacewalk, people! Spacewalk for your lives!

",25,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21294,Zoidberg," Relax, friends.
",17,103,6,15,Leela,Zoidberg21295,Zoidberg," Panic, jerks!
",15,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Hermes21296,Hermes," That's no ordinary space whale!  It's a four-dimensional space whale!
",71,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Amy21297,Amy," Of course! And it only breaches into our 3-D universe to hunt and fill its lungs with vacuum!
",95,103,6,15,Hermes,Leela21298,Leela," Whatever its beef is, our one mission now is to get that monument to Earth.
",77,103,6,15,Amy,Leela21299,Leela," Correction: Our one mission now is to avenge the loss of that monument.
",73,103,6,15,Leela,Amy21300,Amy," Shmeesh! He gonked off the engines!
",37,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21301,Leela," That won't stop me!  Raise the solar sails. I'm goin' after that ""MÃ¶bius Dick"".

",41,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21303,Leela," Comport yourself, Mr. Conrad! When we're at space, the Captain's word is law.  I could marry you and Bender against your will if I wanted to.
",143,103,6,15,Hermes,Hermes21304,Hermes," You wouldn't dare!
",20,103,6,15,Leela,Bender21305,Bender," I've been married to worse.
",29,103,6,15,Hermes,Fry21306,Fry," Leela, I'm no doctor, but I'm afraid you be exhibiting symptoms of illin'.  You're risking all our lives for your own personal obsession.
",139,103,6,15,Bender,Leela21307,Leela," There's nothing personal about this!  That thing screwed up my delivery! This time,  it's business!
",101,103,6,15,Fry,Leela21308,Leela," Maybe, if I move the compass like this, it will somehow kill the whale.
",73,103,6,15,Leela,Amy21309,Amy," Leela, we need to talk. You've gone from crazy like a fox to crazy like Fox News!
",83,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21310,Leela," Fear not the space behemoth.  In my dreams, I've peered beyond its eyes and into the cackling hell within us all.
",115,103,6,15,Amy,Fry21311,Fry," Okay...  That's a good point.
",31,103,6,15,Leela,Bender21312,Bender," Fry's right! Let's kill the Captain and order some strippers!   Yeah, what he said.   It's a mutiny led by Fry!
",113,103,6,15,Fry,Leela21313,Leela," That's enough insubordination, Mr. Fry!
",41,103,6,15,Bender,Bender21314,Bender,"  String 'im up!
",17,103,6,15,Leela,Bender21315,Bender," Things look bad enough without having to look closer at them.  Look! Off in the distance! It's exhaling!
",106,103,6,15,Bender,Leela21316,Leela,"  Use boaty talk!
",18,103,6,15,Bender,Bender21317,Bender," Thare she blows!
",18,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21318,Leela," Alright.  Which of you space dogs has the guts and know-how to harpoon that whale?
",84,103,6,15,Bender,Amy21319,Amy," I spent a semester in Africa harpooning giraffes. And giraffes are basically just land space whales.
",102,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21320,Leela," Miss Wong, you have the 'poon.
",32,103,6,15,Amy,Amy21321,Amy," Oh, God! I'm having a Serengeti flashback!  Die, you dirty giraffe!
",69,103,6,15,Leela,Amy21322,Amy," Well, I got it. Now what, Captain?
",36,103,6,15,Amy,Leela21323,Leela," You know, I'm not sure.  I guess I thought whales died when you harpooned them.
",81,103,6,15,Amy,Leela21324,Leela,"  Don't worry.
",15,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21325,Leela," I'll drop the anchor.
",23,103,6,15,Leela,Zoidberg21326,Zoidberg," Ouch.
",7,103,6,15,Leela,Hermes21327,Hermes," She's diving into the fourth dimension!
",41,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Amy21328,Amy," We have to cut the rope!
",26,103,6,15,Hermes,Leela21329,Leela," Negative, Sailor Moon.  We're goin' for a sleigh ride.
",56,103,6,15,Amy,Hermes21330,Hermes," I can see sideways in time.
",29,103,6,15,Leela,Amy21331,Amy," Gee, I see CGI.  IGC ees I, eej.
",34,103,6,15,Hermes,Fry21332,Fry," Poop!  Poop!
",14,103,6,15,Amy,Bender21333,Bender," Aw, yeah.   Bender! Bender! Bender!
",37,103,6,15,Fry,Bender21334,Bender," Aw. That was the greatest uncountably infinite bunch of guys I ever met.
",74,103,6,15,Bender,Amy21335,Amy," Look out!  It's pulling us through a field of spacebergs!
",59,103,6,15,Bender,Bender21336,Bender," Stupid rocks!  Think they're so great!
",40,103,6,15,Amy,Amy21337,Amy," Well, they are giant diamonds.

",8,103,6,15,Amy,Bender21339,Bender," Come to papa!
",15,103,6,15,Bender,Fry21340,Fry," A lotta Bender fell outta the crow's nest!  We need to cut the line!
",70,103,6,15,Bender,Leela21341,Leela," Enough of your mad obsession with Bender, Fry! We've got to murder that whale or die trying.
",94,103,6,15,Fry,Hermes21342,Hermes," This has gone too far!  Bender's one of Planet Express' most expensive appliances! And he's in trouble!
",105,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21343,Leela," That's it!  I warned you. Fry, Zoidberg, I now pronounce you man andâ€”
",71,103,6,15,Hermes,Zoidberg21344,Zoidberg," Aw! So close.
",15,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21345,Leela," Unsit me, Mr. Conrad. We can't let the whale win! Hi-yah!   You're all too weak!  I can see that now. So I'll have to be my own crew!  Understood?  You've gone mad, Captain.  That's enough outta me!  Now come on! I gotta find that whale.  I found 'im!  With my Oxo Good Grips Cheese knife, I stab at thee.  You do know I'm stabbing at thee, right?
",349,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21346,Zoidberg," Hello.
",8,103,6,15,Leela,Farnsworth21347,Farnsworth," Think, Zoidberg.  You must remember something!
",48,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21348,Zoidberg," No! Nothing! For all I know, our friends could've been eaten by some kind of crazy space whale!
",97,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21349,Farnsworth," Damn that Bermuda Tetrahedron!  It's taken my latest crew just as it took my first one!
",89,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21350,Zoidberg," Not to mention those single socks from the dryer. Am I right?
",63,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21351,Farnsworth,"  Shut up, Zoidberg!   Oh, Zoidberg!  The grieving relatives will be gathered here tomorrow in need of comfort.  And, with no stone monument, they may well demand that I refund their admission fees.
",199,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Leela21352,Leela," Where are we?
Hermes: In the belly of the beast.
",50,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Fry21353,Fry," Like that Bible guy who got swallowed by the whale! Pinocchio!
",64,103,6,15,Leela,Amy21354,Amy," This is all Obsessy Bessy's fault!
",36,103,6,15,Fry,Bender21355,Bender," Right on, sister. We should be back at Planet Express right now. Hiding from work in the ceiling. But no!
",107,103,6,15,Amy,Leela21356,Leela," For the last time, I'm not obsessed. I just want this whale to die, die, die!
",79,103,6,15,Bender,Hermes21357,Hermes," Uh-oh. What's that loud digesting sound?
",42,103,6,15,Leela,Fry21358,Fry,"  Holy crap! Four-dimensional bowels!
",38,103,6,15,Hermes,Amy21359,Amy," Einstein was right.
",21,103,6,15,Fry,Leela21360,Leela," Why?!  Why?!  Also, what and how?!
",36,103,6,15,Amy,Male voice21361,Male voice," The great fish has chosen you for a higher purpose.
",53,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21362,Leela," It's a great mammal!  See? It's got whiskers! And I saw it lactating earlier.  Wait.  Who said that?

",85,103,6,15,Deformed man,Lando Tucker21365,Lando Tucker," It's very simple. Well, actually, it's very complicated. Luckily, I'm here to explain it. You see... This space whale feeds on... Obsession!
",142,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21366,Leela," Wow. Are you gross-looking. Go on.
",36,103,6,15,Lando Tucker,Lando Tucker21367,Lando Tucker," The great space serpentâ€”

",10,103,6,15,Lando Tucker,Lando Tucker21369,Lando Tucker,"  Figured out long ago that no one's more obsessed than space captains.
",72,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21370,Leela," Oh!  What are these things?!  Get away!
",41,103,6,15,Lando Tucker,Lando Tucker21371,Lando Tucker," The whale's nearly sucked me dry. It'll need a new source of obsession once I'm gone.
",87,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21372,Leela," How many times do I have to tell other people? I'm not obsessed!
",66,103,6,15,Lando Tucker,Lando Tucker21373,Lando Tucker," The whale is obsession, Leela! And you are the whale!
",55,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21374,Leela,"  I am not the whale! All I wanted was to complete my delivery. Is that too much to ask? One chicken-pickin' delivery? This whale's gonna pay! It can't escape what it already is. Me! I am the whale!   See?
",206,103,6,15,Lando Tucker,Old lady21375,Old lady," Fifty years, Junior! Fifty years of grippling sorrow!

",77,103,6,15,Paper-hatted salesman,Leela21393,Leela," Hello, everyone. I suppose you're wonderin' why my flesh has melded with that of a giant space whale.
",103,103,6,15,Munda,Farnsworth21394,Farnsworth," I'll admit to a polite interest.
",34,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21395,Leela," At first, I was consumed by a dark obsession to kill the whale. Then I was consumed by the whale.
",99,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Zoidberg21396,Zoidberg," That sounds clever, but it doesn't explain much.
",50,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21397,Leela," Shut up, Zoidberg!
",20,103,6,15,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21398,Zoidberg," Okay.
",7,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21399,Leela," You see, beneath my obsession lay an even deeper obsession. An obsession so strong, it allowed me to overpower the beast's will and pilot it through space and time. An obsession... With completing my  delivery!

",34,103,6,15,Old Man,Farnsworth21407,Farnsworth," They haven't aged a day!  The whale must have some kind of MÃ¶bius colon that endlessly recycles time and space!
",113,103,6,15,Mrs. Wong,Scruffy21408,Scruffy," Yup. That stands up to scrutiny.
",34,103,6,15,Farnsworth,Leela21409,Leela," I should've listened to my crew.  That space whale wasn't a monster.  It was the obsession of me and others like me that made it into a monster.
",146,103,6,15,Scruffy,Lando Tucker21410,Lando Tucker," Mainly you.
",13,103,6,15,Leela,Leela21411,Leela," On the other hand, the stupid fish did eat us. You guys wanna do this?

",53,103,6,15,Fry,Zoidberg21415,Zoidberg," Eh!
",5,103,6,15,Candy,Fry21416,Fry,"  After centuries as a delivery boy, nothin' surprises me.

",36,104,6,16,Leela,Fry21420,Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for...  D. Frosted Wang?  Not another crank delivery! Why don't I read these things ahead of time?!  One time was funny. But, every week for ten years, not as funny.
",189,104,6,16,Fry,Ipji21421,Ipji," True. Not as funny. But still somewhat funny.
",47,104,6,16,Fry,Fry21422,Fry," And... And then they burst out laughing a second time.  I've been a delivery boy for a thousand years. Isn't there any room for promotion around here?
",152,104,6,16,Ipji,Hermes21423,Hermes," There'll be no promotions unless somebody dies. And, even then, only if we can bring 'em back as a zombie like Scruffy.
",121,104,6,16,Fry,Scruffy21424,Scruffy," Life and death are a seamless continuum.
",42,104,6,16,Hermes,Fry21425,Fry," Well, could I at least get some encouragement? I could use a shot in the arm.  I got shot in the leg!

",36,104,6,16,Fry,Roberto21427,Roberto," What? A fella can't drop in on ol' friends and hold 'em hostage?

",10,105,6,17,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21707,Farnsworth," Unless we quickly exterminate them, they'll replicate ad infinitum and consume all the matter on Earth.  According to my calculations, there are eleven generations at the moment.  That's 2046 total Benders we need to destroy.
",227,105,6,17,Fry,Bender21708,Bender," Wait. Does that include me?
",29,105,6,17,Farnsworth,Bender21709,Bender," Too bad he didn't have his own Bible.

",29,105,6,17,Amy,Bender21714,Bender," Alright. So I let one measly Bender get away. How much harm can one infinitely self-reproducing Robot do?

",49,105,6,17,Fry,Leela21723,Leela," Wait a second. All Benders are powered by alcohol!
",52,105,6,17,Bender,Farnsworth21724,Farnsworth," Of course! Long before the Benders devour the Earth, they'll deplete the planet's booze and die off. This is a problem that will solve itself.
",144,105,6,17,Leela,Bender21725,Bender," A problem that solves itself? That sounds like a job for me, Bender.

",34,105,6,17,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21734,Farnsworth," I was lying here, snoozing, dreaming, oddly enough, about bathing in champagne with six of the world's most distinguished scientists, when suddenly I realised my bathwater had been transformed into alcohol.

",10,105,6,17,Farnsworth,Fry21736,Fry," Chug! Chug!
",13,105,6,17,Bender,Bender21737,Bender," It's like fine cognac with a hint of aged scrotum.
",52,105,6,17,Fry,Leela21738,Leela," How can this be? I thought the Benders drank all the alcohol in the world!
",76,105,6,17,Bender,Farnsworth21739,Farnsworth," They did. But then they made more! You see, once the Benders reached atomic scale, they began directly manipulating water and CO2 molecules to make alcohol.  In a matter of hours, there will be no more fresh water on Earth.
",225,105,6,17,Leela,Bender21740,Bender," Oh, no! What will I mix with my Scotch?

",59,105,6,17,Amy,Zoidberg21808,Zoidberg," But how?
",10,105,6,17,Farnsworth,Fry21809,Fry," I didn't do it. Bender, did you learn a lesson about not bein' lazy while the rest of us were bombed out of our gourds?
",121,105,6,17,Zoidberg,Bender21810,Bender," Maybe I did, Fry. Maybe I did. Or maybe I rescued one last mini-Bender to fold stupid, ugly sweaters while I laughed at him.  I guess we'll never know.
",153,105,6,17,Fry,Man #121811,Man #1," Mom on deck! Tenâ€”
",19,106,6,18,Bender,Mom21812,Mom," Alright, grunts. Here's your pre-mission pep talk.  Shoot anyone who doesn't obey hard enough.
",96,106,6,18,Man #1,Man #121813,Man #1," Butâ€”
",6,106,6,18,Mom,Mom21814,Mom," Stop gaining knowledge, Hubert!  It's a simple mission.  The grunts catch the Alien, the surgeon guts it, and you smuggle the poison parts back here.
",151,106,6,18,Man #1,Farnsworth21815,Farnsworth," Eh, something about poison. Got it. Eh, by the way, that surgeon...  Where is he?
",83,106,6,18,Mom,Mom21816,Mom," You! Where's the butcher?!
",28,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Man #121817,Man #1," Ma'am, I dunno, ma'am. 'Is duffel bag arrived.
",48,106,6,18,Mom,Zoidberg21818,Zoidberg,"  It's not a duffel bag. It's my apartment.
",44,106,6,18,Man #1,Mom21819,Mom," Hubert, meet John Zoidberg.  You need an Alien hacked to pieces, he's the best there is.  In the budget category.
",115,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Farnsworth21820,Farnsworth,"  Have you ever dissected a Yeti before?
",41,106,6,18,Mom,Zoidberg21821,Zoidberg,"  Pfff.  Himalayan or Neptunian?
",33,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21822,Farnsworth," Tritonian.
",12,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21823,Zoidberg," A Tritonian Yeti?!  You two aren't up to anything unethical, are you?!
",72,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Mom21824,Mom,"  Relax.  There's nothing unethical about covert biological weapons research.   I said, ""Relax.""
",97,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Farnsworth21825,Farnsworth," Ah, Zoidberg.  We've known each other so long that... Sometimes, I don't think we even need words to understand each other.
",125,106,6,18,Mom,Zoidberg21826,Zoidberg," What?
",7,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Leela21827,Leela," Once and for all, Fry, even though it's the future, most objects are still just objects. Not Aliens who look like objects.
",124,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Fry21828,Fry," So my efforts to establish diplomatic relations with the cactus people were doomed from the start.
",100,106,6,18,Leela,Zoidberg21829,Zoidberg," So you're in pain and 'ave a bunch o' needles. I prescribe acupuncture.  Let's begin.   Blood?!  I mean, ""Blood.""
",115,106,6,18,Fry,Fry21830,Fry," Put it back in me!
",20,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21831,Zoidberg," I'm afraid Fry lost a lotta juice.  He's developed Simpsons jaundice.
",71,106,6,18,Fry,Fry21832,Fry," Â¡Ay, caramba!
",15,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21833,Zoidberg," His only hope is some replacement liver. Yours looks like a good match.
",73,106,6,18,Fry,Leela21834,Leela," Well, if it'll help Fryâ€”
",26,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Fry21835,Fry," Careful, Leela!  He knows less about Human anatomy than I do. And I can't even find my own uterus!
",100,106,6,18,Leela,Zoidberg21836,Zoidberg,"  You may feel a slight sawing!
",32,106,6,18,Fry,Zoidberg21837,Zoidberg," And all we need is a little spine supplement to replace what Leela lost in that unavoidable saw mix-up.
",105,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Leela21838,Leela," It wasn't unavoidable!  You just had to stop cutting my spine when I yelled, ""Stop! You're cutting my spine!""
",111,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Fry21839,Fry,"  Quit complaining!  My body rejected your liver and now I've got Garfield syndrome.  I hate Mondays.
",102,106,6,18,Leela,Zoidberg21840,Zoidberg," Anyhow, Hermes, all Leela needs is one of your vertebrae.
",59,106,6,18,Fry,Hermes21841,Hermes," But, Doctor, will I be able to limbo afterwards?
",50,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21842,Zoidberg," Could you limbo before?  Wait. I say, ""Yes."" And you say, ""I couldn't limbo before."" You ruined the joke, Hermes!
",115,106,6,18,Hermes,Zoidberg21843,Zoidberg," There you go, Leela. Good as new!
",35,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Leela21844,Leela," Whoa! Whoa!
",13,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Fry21845,Fry," Oh, sure.
",11,106,6,18,Leela,Leela21846,Leela,"  Whoa!
",8,106,6,18,Fry,Fry21847,Fry,"  Leela's fine.  But my jaundice has progressed a Muppet gangrene. It's not easy being gangrenous.
",99,106,6,18,Leela,Hermes21848,Hermes," I thought you were only gonna take out one vertebra!
",54,106,6,18,Fry,Zoidberg21849,Zoidberg," Yeah, but did you ever play Jenga? Sometimes, you pull one andâ€”
",65,106,6,18,Hermes,Fry21850,Fry,"  Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for ya. I'm not stayin' like this. You're the Doctor!
",86,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21851,Zoidberg," Hmmm. What started out as a pleasant afternoon of drugs and surgery has not gone as planned. But don't worry. We still 'ave three or four coworkers with plenty of spare parts.
",177,106,6,18,Fry,Zoidberg21852,Zoidberg," My first mission.  I'm so excited.  And, after I dissect the Yeti's poison glands, we can stop maybe for ice cream on the way back?  With sprinkles on?
",153,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Farnsworth21853,Farnsworth," Why, you're just a big kid, aren't you, Zoidberg?
",51,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21854,Zoidberg," A very big kid.
",17,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Man #121855,Man #1," We're over the drop zone, gentlemen. Might I suggest you jump out the door and poop yourselves.
",97,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21856,Zoidberg," So, anyway, I hope the men 'ave been taking their hypermalaria pills.
",71,106,6,18,Man #1,Farnsworth21857,Farnsworth," Their wha?!
",13,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21858,Zoidberg," ""Their wha?!""  That's funny. Like a crazy, old man. But you know what's not funny?  Deadly Tritonian hypermalaria. Just be sure to stay outta the methane swamps.  What smells like methane?
",190,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Doctor21859,Doctor," My God. I've never seen such a gruesome shark attack.  Especially this far inland.
",84,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Leela21860,Leela," It wasn't a shark. It was an awful, incompetent doctor.
",57,106,6,18,Doctor,Doctor21861,Doctor," Wow. He must've been a total Zoidberg.
",40,106,6,18,Leela,Hermes21862,Hermes," It was Zoidberg! He brutalised us with power tools, gypsy curses, and hypnosis!
",81,106,6,18,Doctor,Amy21863,Amy," Yes, master.
",14,106,6,18,Hermes,Doctor21864,Doctor," You'll all get through this. I give you my word as a real doctor.
",67,106,6,18,Amy,Bender21865,Bender," What about me?
",16,106,6,18,Doctor,Doctor21866,Doctor," What did 'e do to you?
",24,106,6,18,Bender,Bender21867,Bender," I dunno exactly, but...   I'm incontinent.
",44,106,6,18,Doctor,Doctor21868,Doctor," I'm truly sorry.
",18,106,6,18,Bender,Fry21869,Fry," I consider myself a reasonable man. Quick with a joke. Slow to anger. But Bender can't go on long car trips anymore an' I say Zoidberg must die!
",146,106,6,18,Doctor,Hermes21870,Hermes," People, please!  Let's not overreactâ€”  Death to the crab!
",59,106,6,18,Fry,Farnsworth21871,Farnsworth," How bad is it, Doctor?
",24,106,6,18,Hermes,Zoidberg21872,Zoidberg," Super bad. It's Tritonian hypermalaria.  A lot of these men will be dead within twenty-four hours.
",100,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Man #121873,Man #1," What?!
",8,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21874,Zoidberg," Not you, though!  You'll make a complete recovery and go on to marry a super model!  Funny plague, hypermalaria.  It can kill immediately. Or lie dormant for decades. But, sooner or later, it erupts, causing fever, spasms, madness, coma, and finally... Death.
",261,106,6,18,Man #1,Man #121875,Man #1," What?!
",8,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21876,Zoidberg," Super model!
",14,106,6,18,Man #1,Farnsworth21877,Farnsworth," Oh!  Those poor, doomed bastards. I guess it's up to me to complete the mission.
",82,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Farnsworth21878,Farnsworth," I'll be in the swamp, blowing the smirk off a toxic Yeti.
",59,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Hermes21879,Hermes," Professor, we need to talk!  Man-to-mob.   You need to listen to us! Yes, you do!
",83,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Leela21880,Leela," We've had it with Zoidberg!  We demand you fire him!
",54,106,6,18,Hermes,Farnsworth21881,Farnsworth," Nonsense! Zoidberg's a fine physician.  For Aliens.  Your mistake is being Humans! No. If I'm going to fire anyone, it'll be Scruffy.
",135,106,6,18,Leela,Hermes21882,Hermes,"  Ya can't do that!
",20,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Bender21883,Bender,"  What did Scruffy ever do to you?!
",36,106,6,18,Hermes,Amy21884,Amy,"  Over my dead body!
",21,106,6,18,Bender,Bender21885,Bender," Don't you get it, old man?  Thanks to Dr. Scissor Hands, I wet myself every time I laugh.  It's not funny! Well... I guess it is kinda funny.  Uh-oh.
",151,106,6,18,Amy,Hermes21886,Hermes," Why are you protecting Zoidberg, Professor?  Do you owe him something?
",72,106,6,18,Bender,Leela21887,Leela," Is he blackmailing you somehow?
",33,106,6,18,Hermes,Amy21888,Amy," What does 'e have on you?!  Why have you kept 'im around all these years when 'e's so grossly incompetent?!
",109,106,6,18,Leela,Farnsworth21889,Farnsworth," Long ago, Zoidberg an' I entered into a secret arrangement relating to certain extraordinary events too horrible to reveal.   So there's nothing to be curious about!
",167,106,6,18,Amy,Farnsworth21890,Farnsworth,"  Stop or I'll shoot!   Zoidberg?!
",35,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Zoidberg21891,Zoidberg," You can't hunt a Yeti by yourself, sir.  It's suicidal.
",57,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21892,Farnsworth," So what?!  I'm going to die of hypermalaria, anyway. I was in the same swamp as the rest of the men.
",102,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21893,Zoidberg," Just because you were in the swamp, doesn't necessarily meanâ€”
",63,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21894,Farnsworth," I was thirsty from the flight! I drank swamp water! Look, Zoidberg.  You're a loyal friend.
",93,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21895,Zoidberg,"  Friend?!
",11,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21896,Farnsworth," But I'm doomed.  I might as well capture a Yeti and die trying.
",65,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21897,Zoidberg," Then you'll need someone to dissect it!  Friend.
",50,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21898,Farnsworth," Go, Johnny! Go!  That's an order!
",35,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21899,Zoidberg," Never! Zoidberg doesn't abandon a friend apparently.
",54,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21900,Farnsworth," Ooh! Ooh-ho-ho!
",17,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21901,Zoidberg," I'll save us! By scaring 'im off with my crazy war noise!  Crunch all you want. I'll make more.
",97,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Zoidberg21902,Zoidberg," Oy.  I lost another one.
",26,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Leela21903,Leela,"  Zoidberg...   I'm sorry to break it to you this way, but we hate you and we never wanna see you again.
",105,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21904,Zoidberg," But, friendsâ€”
",15,106,6,18,Leela,Hermes21905,Hermes," We're not your friends! We're your victims!
",45,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21906,Zoidberg," I was just trying toâ€”
",23,106,6,18,Hermes,Amy21907,Amy," Shut up and give me my kidney back!
",37,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21908,Zoidberg," I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
",24,106,6,18,Amy,Fry21909,Fry," We dunno why the Professor keeps you around here and we don't care!   You're a terrible doctor!   Nobody wants to see you ever again!
",135,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Farnsworth21910,Farnsworth," Dr. Zoidberg, I want to see you right now!
",44,106,6,18,Fry,Farnsworth21911,Farnsworth," The time 'as come, my friend.  We have to talk about... Our arrangement.
",74,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Zoidberg21912,Zoidberg," Oh, no!  No! No!  Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no!
",43,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Zoidberg21913,Zoidberg," Oh, no!
",9,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Farnsworth21914,Farnsworth," Unpaw him, you big ape!  I saw this in a Tarzan movie.  It was called...  Tarzan versus the Yetis.  I lost my virginity...  Ooh! During the film. So I'm... Hah!  A little fuzzy on the details.  Oh!  John...  Are you alright?
",226,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21915,Zoidberg," You!  You saved my life!
",26,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21916,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff.
",11,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21917,Zoidberg," Yes, fuff.  How can I ever repay you?! Do you need a slave?  Or maybe a butler?
",81,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21918,Farnsworth," No, I haven't needed a butler since grad school. But I do need a doctor.  I don't wanna die like those marines, John.  The fever! The madness!
",144,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21919,Zoidberg," Don't forget the spasms, coma, and death.
",43,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21920,Farnsworth," I don't want to go through that!  I want you to kill me!
",58,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21921,Zoidberg," Alright.  Give me the knife.
",30,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21922,Farnsworth," Not now!  Hypermalaria can lie dormant for years.  Isn't that what you said?
",78,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21923,Zoidberg," It sounds like something I would say.
",39,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21924,Farnsworth," So stay with me until the symptoms start. Then...  Put me out of my misery. You must swear!
",93,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21925,Zoidberg," Alright, Hubert.  I swear.
",28,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21926,Farnsworth," It's started, Zoidberg. The fever. The muscle spasms.  I'm dying.  It's time for you to keep your promise and kill me.
",120,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21927,Zoidberg," This is very difficult.  But I'll try...  Friend.
",51,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21928,Farnsworth," No! Wait!  I'm afraid to die!
",31,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21929,Zoidberg," Argh!  You said you wanted me to kill you!  Is this one o' those ""No means yes"" deals?!
",89,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21930,Farnsworth," Yes and no.  I do want you to kill me. But I mustn't see it coming. That would be agony!  So you must murder me completely by surprise.
",137,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21931,Zoidberg," As God is my witness, you can count on me.  Well... See you tomorrow.
",71,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21932,Farnsworth," Not surprising enough!
",24,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Farnsworth21933,Farnsworth," Eh, wha?! Oh!  My...  Heart!
",30,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Fry21934,Fry," Hey!
",6,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Leela21935,Leela," What are you doing there?
",27,106,6,18,Fry,Farnsworth21936,Farnsworth," Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!
",28,106,6,18,Leela,Zoidberg21937,Zoidberg," Stop! You don't understand!
",29,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Leela21938,Leela," Let's go, you murderer! Fry, help me lock 'im up!
",51,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Fry21939,Fry," Hang on. I'm learnin' how to do loop-de-loops.
",48,106,6,18,Leela,Farnsworth21940,Farnsworth," Whoa! Whoa! Woo!
",18,106,6,18,Fry,Zoidberg21941,Zoidberg," You're making a mistake! I was only trying to kill the Professor!
",67,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Bender21942,Bender," Ooh.
",6,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21943,Zoidberg," Hubert... I'm sorry.  Wha?! He doesn't have hair.  Great Little Caesar's ghost!
",81,106,6,18,Bender,Farnsworth21944,Farnsworth," You fools!  You stupid, life-prolonging fools!  I asked Zoidberg to kill me!
",78,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Amy21945,Amy," Huh?!
",7,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Bender21946,Bender," What you talkin' 'bout, Professor?!
",37,106,6,18,Amy,Hermes21947,Hermes," Professor, have you gone mad?!
",32,106,6,18,Bender,Farnsworth21948,Farnsworth," Probably!  It's one o' the symptoms of Tritonian hypermalaria!
",64,106,6,18,Hermes,Amy21949,Amy," You mean the incurable disease that causes fever...  Spasms...  Insanity...  Coma...  And finally death?!
",107,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth21950,Farnsworth," Yes! And I begged Zoidberg to put me out of my misery!  Bring 'im!  Quickly!
",78,106,6,18,Amy,Scruffy21951,Scruffy," Hmmm. Should've known better than to store my antiques in the office.
",71,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Leela21952,Leela," Zoidberg, we were wrong!  We're letting you out so you can kill the Professor!
",80,106,6,18,Scruffy,Zoidberg21953,Zoidberg,"  Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop.
",48,106,6,18,Leela,Amy21954,Amy," Oh, no!  He sand-crabbed out!
",31,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Leela21955,Leela," Then we have no choice. We'll have to mercy-kill the Professor ourselves.
",75,106,6,18,Amy,Bender21956,Bender," Well, let's get started.
",26,106,6,18,Leela,Walt21957,Walt," We have a situation, Mother. This creature tried to sand-crab into the building.
",82,106,6,18,Bender,Mom21958,Mom," Zoidberg?!
",12,106,6,18,Walt,Zoidberg21959,Zoidberg," Sorry I didn't call first, Carol. Uh... But I'm in a hurry! I need your help to save Hubert!
",94,106,6,18,Mom,Mom21960,Mom,"  Let him go  and stooge the hell out of here!
",47,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Larry21961,Larry," We're on it.
",14,106,6,18,Mom,Walt21962,Walt," Ow!
",5,106,6,18,Larry,Igner21963,Igner," Ow!
",5,106,6,18,Walt,Larry21964,Larry," Ow!
",5,106,6,18,Igner,Zoidberg21965,Zoidberg," Beautiful kids. You must be very proud!
",41,106,6,18,Larry,Mom21966,Mom," John Zoidberg... It's been a long time. How've you been?
",58,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21967,Zoidberg," Not too bad.  Last year, I took a bus trip to the Grand Canyon.  Later, I'll show you the pictures.
",101,106,6,18,Mom,Mom21968,Mom," Do you ever regret it, John?  Leaving me to work for the Professor?
",69,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21969,Zoidberg," What do you want me to say?  'E saved my life.
",48,106,6,18,Mom,Mom21970,Mom," Oh, big deal! You could've been rich if you'd stayed.  Your own lab... A full staff...
",88,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21971,Zoidberg," But Hubert is my friend.  'E's very sick.  I can cure him. But I need the thing! The thing...  From Triton!
",109,106,6,18,Mom,Mom21972,Mom," It'll cost you, John.  How much are you worth now?

",106,106,6,18,Mom,Mom21974,Mom,"  Oh, John.  That's really all you have?   Then I'll take it.
",62,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Scruffy21975,Scruffy," Okay.  Murdolator's finished.
",31,106,6,18,Mom,Bender21976,Bender," I said I'd kill 'im myself!  Nobody listens to Bender!
",56,106,6,18,Scruffy,Leela21977,Leela," We all have to share in the guilt.  Which is why we're each going to add one drop of cyanide to the death wheel as it goes by.
",128,106,6,18,Bender,Scruffy21978,Scruffy," Commence mercy-killing...  In three...  Two...  Ayup.
",55,106,6,18,Leela,Hermes21979,Hermes," Kill-check one is go!
",23,106,6,18,Scruffy,Leela21980,Leela,"  Yay!

",32,106,6,18,Amy,Leela21991,Leela,"  Zoidberg!   We know about your secret agreement.  I am so, so sorry for how we treated you.
",94,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Fry21992,Fry," And, to make it up to you, we're killing the Professor for you so he doesn't die horribly from hypermalaria.
",110,106,6,18,Leela,Zoidberg21993,Zoidberg," 'E doesn't have hypermalaria, you idiots!  'E has Yetiism.  When 'e saved my life all those years ago, 'e was scratched by a Yeti!
",132,106,6,18,Fry,Fry21994,Fry," Hmmm. I consider myself almost completely ignorant of modern medicine.  And I've never heard of Yetiism.
",106,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21995,Zoidberg," It mimics the symptoms of hypermalaria exactly.  Except for the part where, instead of dying, you turn into a Yeti!  Wow!  Hold 'im down while I prepare the antidote.
",168,106,6,18,Fry,Leela21996,Leela," Another Yeti?!
",16,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21997,Zoidberg," Yes.  The same jerk that once noshed on me like a shrimp toast.  Now, who's getting 'is pineal gland extracted?  Ah, yes.  This contains a concentrated form of the Yeti neurotoxin.
",182,106,6,18,Leela,Hermes21998,Hermes," But that's what gave 'im Yetiism in the first place! Won't it just make 'im a double Yeti?!
",93,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg21999,Zoidberg," Don't lecture me about Alien physiology, Conrad! The pineal neurotoxin neutralises the adrenal neurotoxin. That's why Yetis don't drive themselves mad!
",153,106,6,18,Hermes,Fry22000,Fry," My God. He's like some kinda believable Hulk!
",47,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg22001,Zoidberg," No time for an injection.  Uh!   I'll be damned. It did make 'im a double Yeti!
",81,106,6,18,Fry,Amy22002,Amy,"  It wasn't supposed to do any of those things.

",32,106,6,18,Amy,Bender22004,Bender," Wow!  Alright, let's set it up and try again.
",47,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth22005,Farnsworth," There's one thing I don't understand, Zoidberg.  How did you persuade Mom to give you her precious Yeti head? Did you 'ave to promise anything in return?
",155,106,6,18,Bender,Zoidberg22006,Zoidberg,"  Nothing. Nothing at all.
",27,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Amy22007,Amy," This calls for a celebration! Come on, everyone!  Let's go tanning!
",69,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Bender22008,Bender," Hooray!
",9,106,6,18,Amy,Farnsworth22009,Farnsworth," Yay!
",6,106,6,18,Bender,Zoidberg22010,Zoidberg,"  I was going to tan...  Once.
",31,106,6,18,Farnsworth,Farnsworth22011,Farnsworth," What do you say, Johnny?  It's on me.
",39,106,6,18,Zoidberg,Zoidberg22012,Zoidberg,"  Thank you, Hubert.

",10,107,6,19,Amy,Hermes22018,Hermes," Oh, God, no! Get out of here, you horrific sausage!
",53,107,6,19,Bender,Leela22019,Leela," Wait! Isn't today the parade? It's just a giant balloon!
",58,107,6,19,Hermes,Fry22020,Fry," Giant balloon?
",16,107,6,19,Leela,Bender22021,Bender," See, buddy? It's not so scary.
",32,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22022,Fry," I feel better now.  Why is so many different parades smooshed together?
",73,107,6,19,Bender,Leela22023,Leela," It's the Parade Day parade.
",29,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22024,Fry," What's Parade Day?
",20,107,6,19,Leela,Farnsworth22025,Farnsworth," It used to be that every group in New New York wanted their own parade. Why, when I was a boy, we had a parade every day. Those were dark times.
",146,107,6,19,Fry,Leela22026,Leela," Now we just combine them all into one big Parade Day parade and get it over with.
",83,107,6,19,Farnsworth,Zoidberg22027,Zoidberg," Hey, look! A fog is rolling in.
",33,107,6,19,Leela,Hermes22028,Hermes," No, that's just the Jamaican pride float.
",43,107,6,19,Zoidberg,Amy22029,Amy," Looks like it's speeding up.
",30,107,6,19,Hermes,Hermes22030,Hermes," Oh, no! It's within munching distance of the Doritos float.
",61,107,6,19,Amy,Zapp22031,Zapp," Thank you! Thank you!  Kif, you're slacking off of my waving arm.
",67,107,6,19,Hermes,Leela22032,Leela," Oh, no! It's heading right for those two nerds!
",49,107,6,19,Zapp,Man #1bot22033,Man #1bot," Whoa! Sweet shirt, dude!
",26,107,6,19,Leela,Man #122034,Man #1," Thanks. I have another one that says PALEONTOLOGISTS DO IT IN THE DIRT. I'm a palaeontologist.

",24,107,6,19,Man #1,Woman #122036,Woman #1," Oh, honey! I dig you so much!  Thank you for saving my stupidly dressed husband.  You're a hero!
",98,107,6,19,Fry,Mayor Poopenmeyer22037,Mayor Poopenmeyer," A hero indeed. What's your name, son?
",39,107,6,19,Woman #1,Fry22038,Fry," I dunno. Fry?
",15,107,6,19,Mayor Poopenmeyer,Mayor Poopenmeyer22039,Mayor Poopenmeyer," Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to associate myself with a true hero.  Mr. Fry, allow me to present you with the keys to the city.  This one's for the deadbolt, this is for the top lock... I think this one's for the knob. The city's in a bad neighbourhood.  Care to say a few words, son?
",289,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22040,Fry," Uh... Heroes don't do drugs! Except for Drugman, I guess.
",59,107,6,19,Mayor Poopenmeyer,Mayor Poopenmeyer22041,Mayor Poopenmeyer," I hereby declare that henceforth this Saturday shall be known as Fry-day!
",75,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22042,Fry," It sure was nice of the Mayor's wife to have sex with me.  Huh?
",65,107,6,19,Mayor Poopenmeyer,Bender22043,Bender," You!
",6,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22044,Fry," What?
",7,107,6,19,Bender,Bender22045,Bender," You could've saved the Robot, but instead you saved the Human.  Do you think Human life is more precious than Robot life?
",123,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22046,Fry," No, no... Well, yes, actually.
",32,107,6,19,Bender,Bender22047,Bender," That's it. I'm killin' myself!
",32,107,6,19,Fry,Leela22048,Leela," Oh, Lord.
",11,107,6,19,Bender,Bender22049,Bender," Don't try and talk me out of it!  Well?
",41,107,6,19,Leela,Amy22050,Amy," Bender, you always say you're gonna kill yourself, but you almost never do.
",77,107,6,19,Bender,Hermes22051,Hermes," Yeah. Last time you went to the suicide booth, you ended up dating it for six months.
",87,107,6,19,Amy,Leela22052,Leela," How is Lynn, by the way?
",26,107,6,19,Hermes,Bender22053,Bender," Livin' in Oregon with her crazy mother! See you at my funeral, suckers!
",73,107,6,19,Leela,Bender22054,Bender," Kill me, please!  And make it splatter!
",41,107,6,19,Bender,Suicide Booth22055,Suicide Booth," With pleasure... Bender!
",26,107,6,19,Bender,Bender22056,Bender," Lynn?  Huh, wow, you look great.  Fat, but great. I thought you were in Oregon.
",81,107,6,19,Suicide Booth,Suicide Booth22057,Suicide Booth," My mom tried to commit suicide in me. I don't wanna talk about it.
",68,107,6,19,Bender,Bender22058,Bender," Well, tell your mom I said hello and it's been nice catchin' up with you. Let's get this show on the road!
",108,107,6,19,Suicide Booth,Suicide Booth22059,Suicide Booth," Oh, no! You're going to die, alright. But it won't be suicide. It'll be murder!
",81,107,6,19,Bender,Bender22060,Bender,"  Missed me!
",13,107,6,19,Suicide Booth,Fry22061,Fry," He did it.  He actually did it this time.
",43,107,6,19,Bender,Hermes22062,Hermes," No way, mon. He's fakin' it.  He really is gone.  Everyone, put on your takin'-off caps.
",90,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22063,Fry," Our what?
",11,107,6,19,Hermes,Farnsworth22064,Farnsworth," It's a sign of respect, you savage!
",37,107,6,19,Fry,Amy22065,Amy," Poor, nasty, mean, old Bender. I can't believe we'll never hear his evil laugh again.
",87,107,6,19,Farnsworth,Fry22066,Fry," I miss 'im so much.
",21,107,6,19,Amy,Hermes22067,Hermes," There, there, Fry. He may be gone, but he'll always be with us as a trash can.
",80,107,6,19,Fry,Benders ghost22068,Benders ghost," Look at that loser gettin' garbage dumped in 'im. Glad I'm not him, whoever he is.
",84,107,6,19,Hermes,Leela22069,Leela," Fry, as his only friend, you should have first pick of body parts.
",68,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22070,Benders ghost," Just don't pick his nose!  What's wrong with you guys? This is comedy gold!
",77,107,6,19,Leela,Fry22071,Fry," He always had my back, so I'll take his arm, uh... As a backscratcher.  I love you, Bender. Somebody hand me a bolt cutter.
",125,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22072,Benders ghost," Hey, dipshlits! That's not me. I'm right here. Hello!  Pay attention to me!
",77,107,6,19,Fry,Benders ghost22073,Benders ghost," Why can't anybody hear my witty remarks? This is Hell!
",56,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Robot #1 Devil22074,Robot #1 Devil," Feh! You wish!
",16,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22075,Benders ghost," Robot Devil? You can hear me? Why is everyone else ignoring me?
",65,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22076,Robot #1 Devil," Isn't it obvious, Bender?
",27,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22077,Benders ghost," Yeah, I guess it is.
",22,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22078,Robot #1 Devil," You're dead!
",14,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22079,Benders ghost," What?! I thought I just had laryngitis and anti-gravity.
",58,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22080,Robot #1 Devil," Come down to my office and I'll explain everything.
",53,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22081,Benders ghost," So what's happenin' to me? And I'll take my answer in any form but a song!
",76,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22082,Robot #1 Devil," Oh, you're no fun.  You see, Bender, it's simple. You're a ghost!
",67,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22083,Benders ghost," A g-g-g-g-ghost?!
",19,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22084,Robot #1 Devil," No, just the regular kind.  Because you killed yourself, you're in Limbo. Your software was exported to the computational cloud.
",130,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22085,Benders ghost," Adoy! Wait, Adoy?
",19,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22086,Robot #1 Devil," Your disembodied programme is now running on the wireless network shared by all machinery.
",92,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22087,Benders ghost," Cut to the chase, Smokey! How do I get outta Limbo?
",53,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22088,Robot #1 Devil," That's the laughy part! You can't! You're stuck in an infinite loop.
",70,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22089,Benders ghost," An infinite loop?  I don't have time for that. Man, this is all Fry's fault!
",78,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22090,Robot #1 Devil," Fry? I hate that guy. We once traded hands.  They still stink of candy corn!
",78,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22091,Benders ghost," Get this: That jerk said Human life was more valuable than Robot life!
",72,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22092,Robot #1 Devil," What?!  After all you've done for him, Fry must die.
",54,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22093,Benders ghost," I know, right? I'd murder him good if only I was still alive.
",63,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22094,Robot #1 Devil," Bender, would you like to make a deal?
",40,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22095,Benders ghost," I'm not stupid...  So yes, absolutely.  What have I agreed to?
",64,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22096,Robot #1 Devil," I'll return you to your body... After you use your ghostly powers to scare Fry to death!
",90,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22097,Benders ghost," That sounds fair and also fun. I like that there's no catch this time.
",72,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22098,Robot #1 Devil," But wait. There's a catch.
",28,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22099,Benders ghost," Crap!
",7,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22100,Robot #1 Devil," If you fail, you'll spend eternity here in Robot Hell. Which, as luck would have it, is where I rehearse my band.  Hit it, boys!   Cigars are evil. You won't miss 'emâ€”
",169,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22101,Benders ghost," Okay! I'll do it, I'll do it. Just stop the damn music!
",57,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Benders ghost22102,Benders ghost," Scare Fry to death? Ha. I could do that in my sleep.  What are you, deaf?
",75,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22103,Benders ghost," Soap. I know Fry's afraid of that.  Maybe he'll die if I rub 'im all over with it real slow.  Whoa, it's sick! My software can control electronics.
",149,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Fry22104,Fry," What theâ€”  No! Not the armpits! Winter's coming!
",50,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Hermes22105,Hermes," As you can see, since Bender's death, requests to bite one's shiny metal ass are down 98%.  Do you mind doing that later?!
",124,107,6,19,Fry,Scruffy22106,Scruffy," Bite my shiny metal ass.
",26,107,6,19,Hermes,Fry22107,Fry," Help! I was attacked in my bathroom! By my bathroom! I'm being haunted by a ghost!
",84,107,6,19,Scruffy,Amy22108,Amy," Fry... You're just upset because you drove Bender to suicide. Here, take your mind off it with these soothing relaxation balls.
",129,107,6,19,Fry,Benders ghost22109,Benders ghost," Alright. I got 'im all heebie-jeebied with my bathroom harass.  One more good scare and I'll be outta Limbo!
",110,107,6,19,Amy,Hermes22110,Hermes," Did someone say Limbo?
",24,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22111,Benders ghost," Hold on to your dookie. It's about to get spooky.
",51,107,6,19,Hermes,Fry22112,Fry," I'm tellin' ya. Somethin' supernatural is happening. I'm scared to death!
",75,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Leela22113,Leela," Stop being ridiculous. There's no such thing as whatever you're saying.
",73,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22114,Fry,"  Ow! Ow! Ow!
",14,107,6,19,Leela,Leela22115,Leela," Whoa. Maybe you're right. I only meant to slap you twice.
",59,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22116,Fry," All I know is I've got a ghost that needs busting.
",52,107,6,19,Leela,Hermes22117,Hermes," Who you gonna call?
",21,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22118,Fry," Ghoâ€”
",6,107,6,19,Hermes,Female Voice22119,Female Voice," The number you have dialled has been lame since 1989.
",55,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22120,Fry," Now do you believe me?!
",25,107,6,19,Female Voice,Farnsworth22121,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff.  Enough of your superstitious nonsense. I'm sure that whatever is happening can be explained by science.
",116,107,6,19,Fry,Gypsy22122,Gypsy," Let the sÃ©ance begin!
",23,107,6,19,Farnsworth,Farnsworth22123,Farnsworth," I said science!
",17,107,6,19,Gypsy,Gypsy22124,Gypsy," The veil is lifting. I am gazing into the spirit world... And... Nothing.  You said something about a buffet?
",111,107,6,19,Farnsworth,Benders ghost22125,Benders ghost," I'm right here, you lazy shyster!
",35,107,6,19,Gypsy,Gypsy22126,Gypsy,"  Wait. I'm sensing something.
",31,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22127,Benders ghost," I'm rich!  Aw.
",16,107,6,19,Gypsy,Fry22128,Fry,"  Is it a ghost?!
",18,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Gypsy22129,Gypsy," There's no such thing as ghosts, you donkey monkey! It's a Robot ghost.
",73,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22130,Fry," A Robot ghost?! What Robot would wanna haunt me?
",50,107,6,19,Gypsy,Benders ghost22131,Benders ghost," Me, dumbass! Bender, Bender, Bender, Bender!  Aw!  Tell 'im, you baggy, old crone!
",84,107,6,19,Fry,Farnsworth22132,Farnsworth," Finally! Any more ridiculous ideas?
",37,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Reverend Preacherbot22133,Reverend Preacherbot," Hallelujah!  I'm here to conduct a exorcism and avail myself of the buffet.  Can I get an amen and a goodly helpin' of Scruffy's famous corn biscuits?
",152,107,6,19,Farnsworth,Scruffy22134,Scruffy," Right away, Reverend.
",23,107,6,19,Reverend Preacherbot,Reverend Preacherbot22135,Reverend Preacherbot," Oh, Lord. I got the too much macaroni sweats. Now where's this alleged apparition?  Might be a problem with your circuit breaker. See ya.
",139,107,6,19,Scruffy,Fry22136,Fry," Please! I'm under constant attack by machinery. I can't sleep, I can't think. I can't even think!
",99,107,6,19,Reverend Preacherbot,Reverend Preacherbot22137,Reverend Preacherbot," Very well.  This sacramental firewall scans for and removes ghostware in a twenty-foot radius.
",96,107,6,19,Fry,Benders ghost22138,Benders ghost," Bring it on, holy man!
",24,107,6,19,Reverend Preacherbot,Reverend Preacherbot22139,Reverend Preacherbot," Carry this at all times and the demon cannot harm you. It also keeps cats off the sofa. By killin' 'em!
",105,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Fry22140,Fry," So quiet! So peaceful! Time to lower my guard even for a minute.  A heart attack!  Yup, I was right.
",102,107,6,19,Reverend Preacherbot,Benders ghost22141,Benders ghost," Okay, Beelze. Fry's dead.

",25,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22143,Benders ghost," A deal's a deal, so give me my body back.
",43,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22144,Robot #1 Devil," Fry's dead, you say? Funny. That's not what it says on his Wikipedia page.
",76,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22145,Benders ghost," Survived the heart attack?! Damn you, Obamacare!
",50,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Dr. Cahill22146,Dr. Cahill," I'm afraid your heart has suffered a lot of damage, Mr. Fry. And my cleavage isn't helping.
",93,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Farnsworth22147,Farnsworth,"  Not helping him.
",19,107,6,19,Dr. Cahill,Dr. Cahill22148,Dr. Cahill," One more sudden shock will kill you.
",38,107,6,19,Farnsworth,Benders ghost22149,Benders ghost," Sudden? That's just the kind of one more shock I was plannin'.
",64,107,6,19,Dr. Cahill,Fry22150,Fry," The machines. They're after me!
",33,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Dr. Cahill22151,Dr. Cahill," You're suffering from machine phobia. Your only hope is to go to the Amish homeworld, where no machines are allowed.
",118,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22152,Fry," I guess it's for the best.  The only machine I'll ever miss is...  Bender.
",76,107,6,19,Dr. Cahill,Benders ghost22153,Benders ghost," Say what?
",11,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22154,Fry," Now that he's gone, I realise how valuable a Robot life can be... When it belongs to my best friend.
",102,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22155,Benders ghost,"  That's the closest thing to Bender is great that anyone besides me has ever said.

",128,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22157,Benders ghost," I'm sorry, Fry. I'm sorry! Wait for your ghost buddy!
",55,107,6,19,Female Voice,Amish man22158,Amish man," Brother Fry, thou hast visitors.
",34,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Fry22159,Fry," Well, yank my beard. This be a surprise.
",42,107,6,19,Amish man,Leela22160,Leela," How are you, Fry?
",19,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22161,Fry," Thank you for asking, English. My life is simple, but plain. And, though Bender be gone, somehow, I feel he's still with me.
",126,107,6,19,Leela,Benders ghost22162,Benders ghost," I sure am, Brother Fry.  Yo, big bonnet! Move your ugly but modest head covering. Oh, right. You can't hear me.
",113,107,6,19,Fry,Robot #1 Devil22163,Robot #1 Devil," Oh, I hear you loud and clear.
",32,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22164,Benders ghost," You're not Granny Hester! What have you done with Granny Hester?!
",67,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22165,Robot #1 Devil," She's naked, but unharmed. And now, Bender, it's time to fulfil your end of the deal.
",87,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22166,Benders ghost," Sorry. I'm not gonna kill Fry. Take me to Hell for all eternity. Just as long as my little bearded meatbag gets to live.
",122,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22167,Robot #1 Devil," That he will not! For, you see, it is your fate to kill him.
",62,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22168,Benders ghost," Says you!  I would never kill Fry! Not even to save my own life!
",66,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22169,Robot #1 Devil," But, Bender, isn't a Robot life worth ever so much more than a Human life?
",76,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22170,Benders ghost," Of course not! What idiot thinks that?!
",41,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22171,Robot #1 Devil," You!
",6,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22172,Benders ghost," You're usin' my own words against me!  Go to Hell!
",52,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22173,Robot #1 Devil," Soon enough. But, first, the killing. Have you noticed that animals are sometimes spooked by Robot ghosts?
",108,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22174,Benders ghost," So what?! I hate animals!  Run for your life, Fry! Move your hemp flaps!
",74,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22175,Robot #1 Devil," He can't hear you, Bender. I'm afraid your friend is about to be Fully Buckminstered!
",87,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22176,Benders ghost," Oh, yeah? I'll just jump into a machine and get his attention that way.
",73,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22177,Robot #1 Devil," Ah, but there aren't any machines on this planet!
",51,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22178,Benders ghost," There's one, you rusty, old dummy.
",36,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22179,Robot #1 Devil," Hey, no fair! Ocupado!
",24,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22180,Benders ghost,"  Got you! Get over here, Devil!
",33,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Fry22181,Fry," And Scruffy's buffet? How's that going?
",41,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22182,Benders ghost,"  Fry! Fry! Look out for that bowlin' barn!
",44,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22183,Fry," Bender?! Is that thou?
",24,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22184,Benders ghost,"  I love you!
",14,107,6,19,Fry,Amy22185,Amy," Oh, my God! That was close!

",19,107,6,19,Amy,Leela22187,Leela," Are you okay? What just happened?
",35,107,6,19,Hermes,Fry22188,Fry," Well, I think the Robot Devil said he'd loved me in Bender's voice, wearing Granny Hester's clothes. I wanna go home!
",119,107,6,19,Leela,Robot #1 Devils ghost22189,Robot #1 Devils ghost," You still lose, Bender. You failed to kill Fry, so you are banished to Hell.  I get a new body and you get to be a translucid chump 'til the end of time!
",155,107,6,19,Fry,Benders ghost22190,Benders ghost," Big deal! I saved my friend. As far as I'm concerned, I won.
",62,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devils ghost,Robot #1 Devil22191,Robot #1 Devil," Uh, really?   You may find your victory pyrrhic, when subjected to this lyric, for a trillion years or so. Yeah!
",114,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22192,Benders ghost," Whoa!
",7,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Robot #1 Devil22193,Robot #1 Devil," Hey, where are you going?!
",28,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22194,Benders ghost," I don't know and I don't care!
",32,107,6,19,Robot #1 Devil,Benders ghost22195,Benders ghost," Yeah, I'm back!  Wait. This is my stop!  Oh, this guy...
",58,107,6,19,Benders ghost,White Robot #122196,White Robot #1," Bender, for your selfless act in saving Fry, I am pleased to welcome you to Robot Heaven.
",91,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22197,Benders ghost," Shut up, God!
",15,107,6,19,White Robot #1,White Robot #122198,White Robot #1," Beg pardon?
",13,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Benders ghost22199,Benders ghost," I wanna go back to Robot Earth. I mean regular Earth.
",55,107,6,19,White Robot #1,White Robot #122200,White Robot #1," Hey, what are youâ€”  Ow! Hey, stop that! I command you, you jerk!  Just get out.
",81,107,6,19,Benders ghost,Fry22201,Fry," Woo! I've been through the adventure of a lifetime.  Ow!
",58,107,6,19,White Robot #1,Bender22202,Bender," I'm back, baby!
",17,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22203,Fry," You're back from the dead?!
",29,107,6,19,Bender,Bender22204,Bender," I'm back from lots of stuff.
",30,107,6,19,Fry,Fry22205,Fry," Oh, Bender, Bender, I missed you so much!  Hey, wait. Did you haunt me?
",73,107,6,19,Bender,Hermes22206,Hermes," Well, we're bankrupt in six, five...
",38,108,6,20,Fry,Hermes22207,Hermes," Four, three...
",16,108,6,20,Hermes,Hermes22208,Hermes," Two, one. And we're out of business.
",38,108,6,20,Hermes,Farnsworth22209,Farnsworth," Good news! We're back in business. We've been hired to deliver an envelope.
",77,108,6,20,Hermes,Leela22210,Leela," It's crunch time. Let's do this.  It's for you, Professor.
",60,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Farnsworth22211,Farnsworth," Great delivery, everyone. You're the finest crew I've had the honour to work with.  Oh, my. We're being foreclosed upon. You're all terrible and incompetent!
",159,108,6,20,Leela,Amy22212,Amy," I resent that!
",16,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Hermes22213,Hermes," Wait. I found a loophole in the mortgage. If we actually pay it, we can keep the building. We just need...  Eleven million dollars.
",133,108,6,20,Amy,Bender22214,Bender," And... Boned!
",15,108,6,20,Hermes,Farnsworth22215,Farnsworth," Aw. I suppose there's nothing left to do but move out. Leela, Amy, pack us a lunch for our new lives under the bridge while us men reminisce and smoke some stogies.
",166,108,6,20,Bender,Leela22216,Leela," We are not packing lunches, you walking beer commercials. It was you men who drove this company into the ground. Remember Fry's idea to offer free delivery?
",158,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Fry22217,Fry," It got us a lot of customers!
",31,108,6,20,Leela,Leela22218,Leela," We're a delivery company!
",27,108,6,20,Fry,Amy22219,Amy," If you wanna save this company, you should listen to a woman's idea for once.
",79,108,6,20,Leela,Hermes22220,Hermes," Okay. What you got?
",21,108,6,20,Amy,Leela22221,Leela," An airline!
",13,108,6,20,Hermes,Amy22222,Amy," Yeah! Wait, what?
",19,108,6,20,Leela,Leela22223,Leela," We should become a commercial airline. I mean, we've got a ship, and teleporters won't be invented for another fifteen years, according to that guy from the future.
",166,108,6,20,Amy,Amy22224,Amy," Wow! That's actually a really good idea for a woman!
",54,108,6,20,Leela,Farnsworth22225,Farnsworth," Puff! What else you ladies got?
",33,108,6,20,Amy,Bender22226,Bender,"  Girls-of-Planet-Express calendar!
",36,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Fry22227,Fry," Girly calendar? Great idea, Amy!
",34,108,6,20,Bender,Hermes22228,Hermes," Okay, then. Leela, Amy, come to work topless tomorrow.
",56,108,6,20,Fry,Leela22229,Leela," Forget it! I promised myself I wouldn't pose naked until I was married.
",73,108,6,20,Hermes,Hermes22230,Hermes," Sorry. It's in your contract. ""All female employees must pose nude if requested.""
",83,108,6,20,Leela,Leela22231,Leela," That's discriminatory!
",24,108,6,20,Hermes,Hermes22232,Hermes," No, it's in all our contracts. Here's mine. ""All female employees must pose nude if requested.""
",97,108,6,20,Leela,Fry22233,Fry," Sounds fun.
",13,108,6,20,Hermes,Bender22234,Bender," Back to work, Hermes!
",23,108,6,20,Fry,Scruffy22235,Scruffy," Now that's what I call fine print.
",36,108,6,20,Bender,Amy22236,Amy," Okay, but good luck making a girly calendar with only two female employees.
",77,108,6,20,Scruffy,Labarbara22237,Labarbara," Oh, husband! I'm so excited about this new job.
",49,108,6,20,Amy,Hermes22238,Hermes," And it's excited about you, LaBarbara. First order of business is to put on your uniform and take your ID photo.
",114,108,6,20,Labarbara,Leela22239,Leela," Look, I agree that it makes space walking more comfortable, but, for a photo shoot, it's a little... Unsavoury. Over.
",119,108,6,20,Hermes,Bender22240,Bender," Time is money, peaches. Now shut your com link and make love to the camera. And remember: I'm the camera.  Stop actually washin' and play with the sponges!
",157,108,6,20,Leela,Leela22241,Leela," But the ship is dirty.
",24,108,6,20,Bender,Bender22242,Bender," Uh, whatever. I ran out of film an hour ago.
",46,108,6,20,Leela,Farnsworth22243,Farnsworth," No, no. This won't do. A three-month calendar? What is this, Mercury?
",71,108,6,20,Bender,Amy22244,Amy," I told you it wouldn't work.
",30,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Farnsworth22245,Farnsworth," Well, you should've talked louder. Fortunately, I came up with a brilliant idea to save Planet Express. We'll turn it into a commercial airline!
",146,108,6,20,Amy,Leela22246,Leela," But that was my idea!
",23,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Farnsworth22247,Farnsworth," Then you should've talked louder.  What?
",42,108,6,20,Leela,Leela22248,Leela," There. It was hard work, but it beats posing in demeaning, skimpy modelling outfits.
",86,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Farnsworth22249,Farnsworth," Ladies, here are your demeaning, skimpy stewardess outfits.
",61,108,6,20,Leela,Bender22250,Bender," Sorry, ma'am. I'll have to confiscate your artificial knee cap.
",65,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Hattie McDoogal22251,Hattie McDoogal," Okay, here you go.
",20,108,6,20,Bender,Fry22252,Fry," Ladies and gentlemen, this is the plane's president speaking.
",63,108,6,20,Hattie McDoogal,Fry22253,Fry," We are cleared for takeoff.
",29,108,6,20,Fry,Leela22254,Leela," You put Goofus and Ganja in charge? I'm the only trained pilot here.
",70,108,6,20,Fry,Farnsworth22255,Farnsworth," Please, Leela. Who ever heard of a plane with a woman president?
",66,108,6,20,Leela,Bender22256,Bender," Welcome to Plan Am Flight 1 to Acapulsar. The local time on Acapulsar is five years from now.  In the event of a wormhole sendin' us back in time, do not kill your parents. If you who are travelling with small children, help them not to kill you before not killin' your own parents. Now please turn off all electronic devices.
",328,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Fry22257,Fry," Uh, preparing for takeoff.
",28,108,6,20,Bender,Man #122258,Man #1," I kill you, my friend!
",24,108,6,20,Fry,Labarbara22259,Labarbara,"  I hope you all enjoyed our timey beverage service.  Now sit back and endure our in-flight entertainment.
",107,108,6,20,Man #1,Zoidberg22260,Zoidberg,"  Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!  So what's the deal with airline food, hmm? They offer you two choices, but they're always outta one. Uh, by the way, we're outta both choices.
",164,108,6,20,Labarbara,Petunia22261,Petunia," Shut up and put on four episodes of Da Office.
",48,108,6,20,Zoidberg,Amana22262,Amana," Ooh, your hands are warm...  For a Robot.
",43,108,6,20,Petunia,Bender22263,Bender," Thanks, baby. I don't know what you're doing back here in the galley, 'cause you got a first-class C.
",103,108,6,20,Amana,Leela22264,Leela," Captain, we were supposed to land two days ago. Is everythingâ€” Hey!
",69,108,6,20,Bender,Fry22265,Fry," Are we at the fair yet, Mommy?
",32,108,6,20,Leela,Leela22266,Leela," We're not at the any place! And we're out of fuel!
",52,108,6,20,Fry,Amy22267,Amy," Attention, passengers. Please remain seated until the plane comes to a complete crash.
",88,108,6,20,Leela,Farnsworth22268,Farnsworth," Perhaps we should reconsider the girly calendar.
",50,108,6,20,Amy,Leela22269,Leela," Flight-attendance log. We've crashed near a river of mercury on a lifeless, mineral world. Supplies are low. Cannibalism, imminent. Radio, busted. Our one hope is to form a society.
",183,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Hermes22270,Hermes," Okay, then. Men, let's get hunting. The women folk can cook what we catch.
",76,108,6,20,Leela,Labarbara22271,Labarbara," No one put you in charge, husband. I'm the only one here who ever ran a society.
",82,108,6,20,Hermes,Hermes22272,Hermes," Roller derby is not a society!
",32,108,6,20,Labarbara,Labarbara22273,Labarbara," Well, let's put it to a vote, then. All in favour of the jamooca thunderclap?  That would be me.
",98,108,6,20,Hermes,Hermes22274,Hermes," Practically no one. All in favour of me?
",42,108,6,20,Labarbara,Dr. Cahill22275,Dr. Cahill," Eight to eight. It's a tie.
",29,108,6,20,Hermes,Farnsworth22276,Farnsworth," We can't trust a woman's math! Count again!
",45,108,6,20,Dr. Cahill,Big rock Alien22277,Big rock Alien," Greetings, soft ones. Who among you is your leader?
",53,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Men22278,Men," He is!
",8,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Women22279,Women," She is!
",9,108,6,20,Men,Big rock Alien22280,Big rock Alien," Curious. You're a diarchic society?
",37,108,6,20,Women,Hermes22281,Hermes," Um, maybe. But, whatever we are, I'm the leader of it.
",56,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Labarbara22282,Labarbara," Leader? Fat man, you couldn't even run a bath.
",48,108,6,20,Hermes,Labarbara22283,Labarbara," Well, you sure can run something: Your mouth!
",47,108,6,20,Labarbara,Big rock Alien22284,Big rock Alien," Silence! Even a young pebble could see your race is divided based on the configuration of your twenty-third chromosome.
",121,108,6,20,Labarbara,Amy22285,Amy,"  You mean, ""along gender lines""?
",34,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Big rock Alien22286,Big rock Alien,"  Gender?
",10,108,6,20,Amy,Sal22287,Sal," Yes. You knows, guyses, galses... In that order.  Ows!
",56,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Big rock Alien22288,Big rock Alien," I am not familiar with this concept of gender. My species has only a single gender, known as nuchacho.
",104,108,6,20,Sal,Zoidberg22289,Zoidberg," Interesting.  Come on, men! Let's kill him!
",45,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Big rock Alien22290,Big rock Alien," Your genders differ in many ways, but, as with all things that are different, chocolate and vanilla, Mac and PC, one is always clearly better.
",144,108,6,20,Zoidberg,Bender22291,Bender," Chocolate, Mac, men. The end.
",31,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Big rock Alien22292,Big rock Alien," Well, I've got nothing to do for the next eight million years. Therefore, I will administer a series of tests to determine the superior gender. Test number one: Who can drink the most sulfur? Test inconclusive. Test number two: Who can drink the most arsenic?
",261,108,6,20,Bender,Farnsworth22293,Farnsworth," Just ask us some damn questions.
",34,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Big rock Alien22294,Big rock Alien," Very well. Which is larger? An Italian size four or an American apparel medium?  How many calories are in a small green-tea yogurt.  Name any twelve of the Desperate Housewives.  How was your day?  Test complete. What is the score?
",233,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Bender22295,Bender," Uh... Men, five. Women, less.
",31,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Amana22296,Amana," Hey! He's lying.
",18,108,6,20,Bender,Big rock Alien22297,Big rock Alien," Obviously. That was a test to see who could lie better. The men win that round.
",81,108,6,20,Amana,Farnsworth22298,Farnsworth," In your face, decumbent urinators.
",36,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Big rock Alien22299,Big rock Alien," So far, I have learned nothing, but that's probably as much my fault as yours.  The time has come for the final test.
",119,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Fry22300,Fry," Uh, we usually call it the lightning round.
",45,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Big rock Alien22301,Big rock Alien," As you may have noticed, it's getting hotter here.
",52,108,6,20,Fry,Leela22302,Leela," It's nice.
",12,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Fry22303,Fry," It's too hot.
",15,108,6,20,Leela,Zoidberg22304,Zoidberg,"  Would one of you chicks change the thermostat?
",49,108,6,20,Fry,Big rock Alien22305,Big rock Alien," Tomorrow morning, this planet makes its closest pass to the sun. You will all be boiled alive like retired circus animals. Unless you somehow can cross the Great Alkali Plains and reach shelter in the Cave of Harmony.
",219,108,6,20,Zoidberg,Fry22306,Fry," That sounds hard.
",19,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Big rock Alien22307,Big rock Alien," Which ever gender reaches the cave will survive and may the inferior gender burst into something. Flames, I guess.
",116,108,6,20,Fry,Hermes22308,Hermes," Uh-oh. I think we're walking in circles. I recognise the pattern of striations on that gypsum formation.
",106,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Fry22309,Fry," Also, my shoe that fell off.
",30,108,6,20,Hermes,Bender22310,Bender," Oh, God. We're all gonna die in agony.
",40,108,6,20,Fry,Small rock Alien22311,Small rock Alien," Howdy there. You fellows need some directions?

",10,108,6,20,Bender,Fry22314,Fry," Don't worry about it.
",23,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Labarbara22315,Labarbara," Keep it up, sistren. Only a few more miles to the cave. Let's just buckle down andâ€”
",85,108,6,20,Fry,Amy22316,Amy," Look! A clearance sale!
",25,108,6,20,Labarbara,Labarbara22317,Labarbara," What?! Where?
",15,108,6,20,Amy,Labarbara22318,Labarbara," I can't believe that sale was just a mirage. Now we're going to die without so much as a factory second-clutch purse to show for it.
",134,108,6,20,Labarbara,Amy22319,Amy," It would've been nice to shop at Tommy Hilfiger one last time.
",64,108,6,20,Labarbara,Hattie McDoogal22320,Hattie McDoogal," It wasn't Tommy Hilfi-gigger. It was Linens 'n Things!
",56,108,6,20,Amy,Petunia22321,Petunia," The hell it was! It was a Juicy Couture!
",42,108,6,20,Hattie McDoogal,Leela22322,Leela," I guess we all saw what we wanted to see.
",43,108,6,20,Petunia,Hermes22323,Hermes," We can't make it tonight. We'll set up camp here by this shoe.
",64,108,6,20,Leela,Farnsworth22324,Farnsworth," Oh, gentlemen. When that sun rises in the morning, we're toast. These are our last moments together. So, if anyone's got any good fart jokes, now would be the time.
",166,108,6,20,Hermes,Amy22325,Amy," It's a schmundered degrees and all we have to drink are non-diet sodas.
",73,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Petunia22326,Petunia," It's gonna ruin ma figger.
",28,108,6,20,Amy,Leela22327,Leela," Wait. I forgot that Amana here is a refrigerator. If we could supercharge her freon with a gas compressor, we might survive the heat and make it to the cave.
",159,108,6,20,Petunia,Amana22328,Amana," Hey, yeah! But the only gas compressor on this planet is inside Bender's ass.
",79,108,6,20,Leela,Dr. Cahill22329,Dr. Cahill," Was that a fart joke? Because I don't find those amusing.
",59,108,6,20,Amana,Labarbara22330,Labarbara," No one does! Nevertheless, Bender's gas blaster may be our only hope.
",71,108,6,20,Dr. Cahill,Hermes22331,Hermes," Oh! Wife? What are you doin' with Bender's shiny metal, gas compressor?
",73,108,6,20,Labarbara,Labarbara22332,Labarbara," None of your Biz Markie. Wait a second. What's that do wah in your ditty bag?
",79,108,6,20,Hermes,Hermes22333,Hermes," Okay... So we were hot. I stole Amana's freon coil so we could hook it up to Bender's ass and build a cooler.
",111,108,6,20,Labarbara,Labarbara22334,Labarbara," You are no better than me, ya shifty tree skink! How do you live with yourself?
",81,108,6,20,Hermes,Hermes22335,Hermes," Damn it, woman! You are makin' me highly Selassie.
",52,108,6,20,Labarbara,Labarbara22336,Labarbara," Don't you talk to me that way, you big, hairy Belafonte!
",58,108,6,20,Hermes,Hermes22337,Hermes," Oh... You cookin' me back bacon. Thank you, woman.
",52,108,6,20,Labarbara,Labarbara22338,Labarbara," That's not back bacon! That's your back bakin'!
",49,108,6,20,Hermes,Hermes22339,Hermes," Oh, no! We overslept.
",23,108,6,20,Labarbara,Amy22340,Amy," The mercury's boiling!
",24,108,6,20,Hermes,Petunia22341,Petunia," Can't breathe... Lungs burnin'...
",35,108,6,20,Amy,Fry22342,Fry," My lucky shoe!
",16,108,6,20,Petunia,Bender22343,Bender," Goodbye, cruel me!  I learned that from a movie.
",50,108,6,20,Fry,Big rock Alien22344,Big rock Alien," I find both genders supremely disappointing. The real reason I administered this bizarre, outer-space test was to teach you to work together! But you couldn't. Thanks to you, I lost my bet with the Borax Kid.
",210,108,6,20,Bender,Fry22345,Fry," Never bet against me being stupid.
",36,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Big rock Alien22346,Big rock Alien," Enough! Your gender differences have kept you from achieving harmony. There is only one way to resolve this conflict.
",119,108,6,20,Fry,Fry22347,Fry," Wait. Why didn't that hurt?  My wing-wang's gone!
",51,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Leela22348,Leela," My girls!
",11,108,6,20,Fry,Bender22349,Bender," My antenna!
",13,108,6,20,Leela,Hattie McDoogal22350,Hattie McDoogal," My kajigger!
",14,108,6,20,Bender,Zoidberg22351,Zoidberg," My gonopores! Look it up.
",27,108,6,20,Hattie McDoogal,Big rock Alien22352,Big rock Alien," I have freed you from the tyranny of gender. Now go in peace. Or actually stay here. I'll go in peace.
",104,108,6,20,Zoidberg,Farnsworth22353,Farnsworth," Good news, nuchachos! The ship is nearly repaired.
",52,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Sal22354,Sal," Work goes fasters withouts no secondary sex characteristicses at which to hoot. Now who wants to sing some Christopher Cross songs?
",133,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Labarbara22355,Labarbara," I do!
",7,108,6,20,Sal,Fry22356,Fry," Look, associates. I made a hammock from our clothing.
",55,108,6,20,Labarbara,Leela22357,Leela," How industrious!
",18,108,6,20,Fry,Amy22358,Amy," Do you mind if we sleep with you?
",35,108,6,20,Leela,Fry22359,Fry," I have no opinion.  Well, good night.
",39,108,6,20,Amy,Hermes22360,Hermes," Everyone got along so well today.
",35,108,6,20,Fry,Labarbara22361,Labarbara," Yes. This place is like a neutered utopia.  A neutopia!
",57,108,6,20,Hermes,Hermes22362,Hermes," I enjoy humour when no one gets hurt.
",39,108,6,20,Labarbara,Labarbara22363,Labarbara," Your companionship is inoffensive, Hermes.
",44,108,6,20,Hermes,Hermes22364,Hermes," Likewise. Really, what are we missing out on by not having sex right now?
",75,108,6,20,Labarbara,Labarbara22365,Labarbara," Well...
",9,108,6,20,Hermes,Hermes22366,Hermes," Give us back our genitals!
",28,108,6,20,Labarbara,Big rock Alien22367,Big rock Alien," Is that you, Borax Kid? I've got your fifty bucks.  Oh, it's you. Why do you want your genders? You seem happier without them.
",128,108,6,20,Hermes,Labarbara22368,Labarbara," Bein' Human isn't just about bein' happy! It's about lovin' and fightin' and that rasta MacNasty we were doin' last night.  We want that back.
",144,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Big rock Alien22369,Big rock Alien," Very well. Perhaps it is I who have learned a lesson. Or something.
",69,108,6,20,Labarbara,Bender22370,Bender," Now what?
",11,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Big rock Alien22371,Big rock Alien," I have decided, after little thought, to return your genders.
",63,108,6,20,Bender,Amy22372,Amy," Not cool, bro! Our genders are all reversed!
",46,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Hattie McDoogal22373,Hattie McDoogal," Now I got a what-ya-call-it instead of a kajigger, you stupid what-ya-call-it!
",80,108,6,20,Amy,Big rock Alien22374,Big rock Alien," Okay. Stop yelling at me! It was an innocent mistake. Allow me to rectify it.
",79,108,6,20,Hattie McDoogal,Zapp22375,Zapp," I got your distress call and came as quickly as I wanted to. No need to thank me.
",83,108,6,20,Big rock Alien,Leela22376,Leela," What's your problem, Holmes? Now we'll be stuck like this forever!
",68,108,6,20,Zapp,Zapp22377,Zapp," Chill out, dude.  Well, hello from the neck down.
",51,108,6,20,Leela,Bender22378,Bender," Thank you for your patronage. We know you have a choice in airlines and you made the wrong one. No refunds!
",109,108,6,20,Zapp,Hermes22379,Hermes," Aren't we going to cuddle?
",28,108,6,20,Bender,Labarbara22380,Labarbara," Woman, I'm tired! I'm sorry. It's just... I need my sleep. I got to get up five times a night to play Xbox.
",109,108,6,20,Hermes,Hermes22381,Hermes," I understand. Womanhood also takes some getting used to. For example, did you know there are more than two feelin's?
",118,108,6,20,Labarbara,Labarbara22382,Labarbara," I only need one feelin': Love for you, wifey man.
",51,108,6,20,Hermes,Hermes22383,Hermes," Your manwich!
",15,108,6,20,Labarbara,Labarbara22384,Labarbara," No wonder it's such a mess in there. These bad boys are hard to aim.
",70,108,6,20,Hermes,Leela22385,Leela," I hate being a man. I smell bad, my face is scratchy, and the food at those strip clubs is terrible.
",102,108,6,20,Labarbara,Amy22386,Amy," Crappin' A! Still, I'm sure the women are having an even harder time.
",71,108,6,20,Leela,Bender22387,Bender," OMG! Being chicks is so much fun.
",35,108,6,20,Amy,Fry22388,Fry," Now, when I say stupid things, guys all laugh and buy me stuff.
",65,108,6,20,Bender,Leela22389,Leela," What a skank. Anyway, Planet Express is still facing foreclosure. There's no way we can raise enough money to save this company.
",130,108,6,20,Fry,Amy22390,Amy," Wait. What about the girly calendar?
",38,108,6,20,Leela,Fry22391,Fry," Well, that won't work, remember? We only have three women on staffâ€”
",69,108,6,20,Amy,Labarbara22392,Labarbara," ""All female employees must pose nude if requested.""
",53,108,6,20,Fry,Leela22393,Leela," And it is requested.
",22,108,6,20,Labarbara,Farnsworth22394,Farnsworth," Let's just hope we can sell enough of these calendars by tomorrow.
",68,108,6,20,Leela,Farnsworth22395,Farnsworth,"  We sold enough of those calendars since yesterday!
",53,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Leela22396,Leela," Thank God most of our fans are huge perverts!
",47,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Fry22397,Fry," Who're you, stranger?
",23,108,6,20,Leela,Borax Kid22398,Borax Kid," Well, madam, folks called me the Borax Kid. My friend, the other rock Alien, died without settin' your genitals to right, so I reckon it's up to me to sex you up proper.
",171,108,6,20,Fry,Leela22399,Leela," My girls are back!
",20,108,6,20,Borax Kid,Fry22400,Fry," Ow! Yay!
",10,108,6,20,Leela,Hermes22401,Hermes," So what did you like better, my love? Bein' a man or a woman?
",63,108,6,20,Fry,Labarbara22402,Labarbara," I don't care what parts I have. As long as they interlock with yours.
",71,108,6,20,Hermes,Farnsworth22403,Farnsworth," Ah, marriage. It combines the contentedness of being neutered with the occasional sex of being not.
",101,108,6,20,Labarbara,Borax Kid22404,Borax Kid," Well, I'd best mosey on down to the landing. Sounds like the feldspar queen is about to set sail. You folks watch your genitals now.  Come on, boy! Giddy up!
",159,108,6,20,Farnsworth,Leela22405,Leela," And that's that.
",18,108,6,20,Borax Kid,Scruffy22406,Scruffy," What I miss?
",14,108,6,20,Leela,Albert22407,Albert," I got one!
",12,109,6,21,Scruffy,Warden Vogel22408,Warden Vogel," Okay, kids. Put away the dust motes 'til tomorrow.  It's story time!  Today's storyteller is a space captain who grew up right here at the Orphanarium. Welcome back the bedwetter of building D, Turanga Leela!
",210,109,6,21,Albert,Leela22409,Leela," Hi, kids!  What book would you like me to read first?
",55,109,6,21,Warden Vogel,Albert22410,Albert," We don't got books no more.
",29,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22411,Leela,"  What?
",8,109,6,21,Albert,Warden Vogel22412,Warden Vogel," He means any more. Look, sometimes you gotta choose between eatin' and reading.  So they ate the books. Just... Make somethin' up!
",132,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22413,Leela," Make something up? Um... Okay.  Once upon a time, there was a... A...
",71,109,6,21,Warden Vogel,Sally22414,Sally," Princess?
",11,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22415,Leela," Yes! That!  A... One-eyed princess in a long, flowing... Tank top. And she lived in a magical, one-room...
",108,109,6,21,Sally,Sally22416,Sally," Castle?
",9,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22417,Leela," Yeah. If you believe the listing agent. Anyhow, one day, the princess went off to... Uh... Tell a story! And, then, that's exactly what she did do that. And they all lived happily ever after. The end.
",202,109,6,21,Sally,Albert22418,Albert," Miss Leela? I have a question!
",32,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22419,Leela," Yes, Albert?
",14,109,6,21,Albert,Albert22420,Albert," That story was bad.
",21,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22421,Leela," That's not really a question.
",31,109,6,21,Albert,Albert22422,Albert," That wasn't really a story.
",29,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22423,Leela,"  I'm sorry, kids. I'm not a natural storyteller.   But I promise: I'll make up a better story and come back again.
",116,109,6,21,Albert,Sally22424,Sally,"  Please don't...
",18,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22425,Leela," See you soon!
",15,109,6,21,Sally,Leela22426,Leela," I'm sure I've got a great kids' story in me. I just need to think of three of some kind of animal. Concentrate, Leela! Concentrate!   Fry, I'm writing here! Do you have to play that?
",184,109,6,21,Leela,Fry22427,Fry,"  Yes.  It's the only song I know.
",35,109,6,21,Leela,Zoidberg22428,Zoidberg," Look, friends! I accidentally learned to tap-dance!
",53,109,6,21,Fry,Leela22429,Leela,"  Zoidberg, I'm trying toâ€”
",27,109,6,21,Zoidberg,Hermes22430,Hermes," Time for my four-twenty-one daiquiri!
",39,109,6,21,Leela,Bender22431,Bender," Guys! Guys! Guess who just got commissioned as a tugboat!

",26,109,6,21,Amy,Farnsworth22434,Farnsworth," Ooh, good, Leela. You're here.  I'd like to describe my foot pain.  My left has a sharp jabbing throb near the bunion, while the other's got a searing pain like gout.  Maybe it's too much albumin because of gravity...
",219,109,6,21,Pachinko machine,Leela22435,Leela," Even if I had a pen, I couldn't write under these conditions.  I'm going to some other planet, where I can concentrate.

",60,109,6,21,Leela,Bender22437,Bender,"  Well, that was rude.
",23,109,6,21,Farnsworth,Leela22438,Leela," Warden Vogel, I have a new story for the children.  I'm sure they'll like it more than my last one.
",101,109,6,21,Bender,Warden Vogel22439,Warden Vogel," They liked hunger cramps more than your last one. Anyhow, you'll have to wait. The kids are busy right now.

",50,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22455,Leela," It's about some cute, little creatures from a land called Rumbledy-Hump.  Kids, let's meet the Humplings! 
 My name is Lady Buggle and I huggle all my friends. 
 I'm a silly spring named Doingg and my bouncing never ends.  Doingg. Doingg. Doingg. 
 They call me Princess Num Num. I'm as sweet as sticky buns. 
 I'm Feffernoose. 
 Hello. 
 I'm scared of everyones.
 Oh, Feffernoose. 
 What about me? 
 Hey, it's Garbly. Everyone loves him 'cause they can't understand him.
 It's nice to meet you.
 We're here to make you laugh and think and smile and learn and sing.
And laugh and learn and smile and think and other happy things.
",631,109,6,21,Sally,Albert22456,Albert," Say more things like that!
",28,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22457,Leela," Okey-doke. One sunny, funny day, there was an unfamiliar visitor in Rumbledy-Hump.
",84,109,6,21,Albert,Leela22458,Leela,"  Today we learned that folks are not as different as they seem. 
 The space gorilla's just like us.
 Although I breathe chlorine.

",53,109,6,21,Leela,Nina22460,Nina," Will you come back again and tell us more stories and also adopt us all?
",74,109,6,21,Sally,Leela22461,Leela," Of course I'll tell you more stories.  I'll go think some up right now.

",44,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Abner Doubledeal22464,Abner Doubledeal," I brain-scanned those little nose-pickers during your story. And, sister, their enjoyment glands were squirtin' like Broadway roadkill!

",19,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Abner Doubledeal22466,Abner Doubledeal," Say, you seem like a smart mark.  How'd you like to make it into a TV show? Sign here, 'round this... Uh...  Supercuts coupon.
",128,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22467,Leela,"  I dunno.  Don't I need a degree to write gibberish for toddlers?

It's just that I'm in show biz.
",310,109,6,21,Fry,Leela22475,Leela," Sorry. I went to my quiet place to write. Here's the script.
",62,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Abner Doubledeal22476,Abner Doubledeal," Argh! You writers make me sick. Nice job on the script, though. Places, everyone.  Okay. Cheap lights. Off-brand camera. And non-union action!
",144,109,6,21,Leela,Fry22477,Fry,"  I like ice cream. And I like lollipops. And I like you, Princess Num Num.
",76,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Amy22478,Amy,"  Ew! I'm all licky-sticky!
",28,109,6,21,Fry,Fry22479,Fry,"  I don't understand. When I like something, I lick it. Like this raccoon.
",75,109,6,21,Amy,Leela22480,Leela,"  Doingg! Don't lick things that don't wanna be licked.
",56,109,6,21,Fry,Fry22481,Fry,"  But how do I know what to lick and what not to lick?
",55,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22482,Leela,"  It's very simple.  If it's alive, don't lick it.
",51,109,6,21,Fry,Zoidberg22483,Zoidberg,"  Like a horse, a turtle, or a cricket.
",40,109,6,21,Leela,Bender22484,Bender,"  I like turtles.
",18,109,6,21,Zoidberg,Leela22485,Leela,"  So, if you're not sure if it's alive or dead,
Poke it with a stick and lick the stick instead.
",97,109,6,21,Bender,Fry22486,Fry,"  Now I get it!
",16,109,6,21,Leela,Zoidberg22487,Zoidberg,"  Ow!
",6,109,6,21,Fry,Leela22488,Leela,"  Well, that's all for today. But, before we go, let's do everything we just did two more times.
",97,109,6,21,Zoidberg,Bender22489,Bender," Leela, that was great! Even I have to admire the performance of me, Bender!
",77,109,6,21,Leela,Amy22490,Amy," The show looks so cute. Kids'll love it! And it looks so cruddy, their ironic hipster parents will love it.
",109,109,6,21,Bender,Leela22491,Leela," Thanks, guys. But let's be realistic. We all know any TV show that's even slightly good gets cancelled. Sometimes, two or three times.
",136,109,6,21,Amy,Abner Doubledeal22492,Abner Doubledeal," Leela! Tomorrow's ratings just came in from the future. We're a hit!
",70,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22493,Leela," What?! My show is a hit?!
",27,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Abner Doubledeal22494,Abner Doubledeal," What are you, deaf? It's gonna be bigger than SpongeBot SquareBolts!
",70,109,6,21,Leela,SpongeBot SquareBolts22495,SpongeBot SquareBolts," I interfere with pacemakers!
",30,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Abner Doubledeal22496,Abner Doubledeal," Baby, I hope you like drowning in caviar. 'Cause that is how you're gonna die!
",80,109,6,21,SpongeBot SquareBolts,Calculon22497,Calculon," Welcome back to the Young People's Choice Awards. In a moment, the award for Outstanding Sext Message. But, first, the nominees for Best New Kids' Show are... Yo Gimme Gimme!, The Adventures of Pit-Bull and Scaredy Squirrel, Dora the Destroyer, and Rumbledy-Hump.
",265,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Fry22498,Fry," I hope you win, Leela.
",24,109,6,21,Calculon,Leela22499,Leela," Thanks, Fry. It's nice to have the support of viewers like you.
",65,109,6,21,Fry,Fry22500,Fry," I'm the star of the show.
",27,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22501,Leela," Shh!
",6,109,6,21,Fry,Calculon22502,Calculon," And the Slurmie for Best New Kids' Show goes to... Turanga Leela for Rumbledy-Hump!
",85,109,6,21,Leela,Female Voice22503,Female Voice," This is Turanga Leela's first nomination and second time in high heels.
",73,109,6,21,Calculon,Leela22504,Leela," Wow. I feel so lucky just to have been nominated alongside so many inferior shows. And, to all my young friends at the Orphanarium, thank you for inspiring me to be your hero.
",177,109,6,21,Female Voice,Calculon22505,Calculon," Slurm her!
",12,109,6,21,Leela,Bender22506,Bender," So wait. You play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star who's also secretly a massage chair?
",110,109,6,21,Calculon,Fembot #122507,Fembot #1," No. I play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star, but, in real life, I'm a massage chair.
",107,109,6,21,Bender,Bender22508,Bender," Hmmm. You ever made out with a tugboat?
",41,109,6,21,Fembot #1,Leela22509,Leela," Guys, I didn't have time to mention it up there, but I want each of you to know what an honour it is to work with me.
",119,109,6,21,Bender,Hermes22510,Hermes," Sweet ego of Montego! Someone build a wind farm in front of her mouth.
",72,109,6,21,Leela,Abner Doubledeal22511,Abner Doubledeal," Leela, I mean this. You're the greatest creative mind since blah, blah, blah-bity, blah. But it's two AM and you still haven't written tomorrow's episode.
",156,109,6,21,Hermes,Leela22512,Leela," Well, you can't expect me to write it here, with everyone talking so loudly about how great I am.
",99,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Abner Doubledeal22513,Abner Doubledeal," Sorry.
",8,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22514,Leela," I'm taking the ship to my quiet place so I can be alone. You non-creatives can catch a bus home.
",98,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Fry22515,Fry," Non-creative? Ha! I'll have you know I bedazzle my own underpants.
",68,109,6,21,Leela,Bender22516,Bender," That was a helluva massage. Maybe the best there ever was. Say, where are we? Rumbledy-Hump?! It's real!
",106,109,6,21,Fry,Doingg22517,Doingg," I love eating vegetables. Don't you? They're like crunchy, green water.
",73,109,6,21,Bender,Garbly22518,Garbly,"  I don't like 'em. They're icky-yucky!
",40,109,6,21,Doingg,Lady Buggle22519,Lady Buggle," Now, now, Garbly. If we don't eat our vegetables, we won't grow big and strong... Like Feffernoose.
",101,109,6,21,Garbly,Feffernoose22520,Feffernoose," I have to be big and strong to fight off the monsters. Did somebody say monsters?!
",84,109,6,21,Lady Buggle,Leela22521,Leela," This will make a great episode. But talk slower. I can't type that fast.
",74,109,6,21,Feffernoose,Bender22522,Bender," Well, well, well. You didn't make up that TV show! You just wrote down what these space twerps said!
",102,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22523,Leela," Oh, hell.
",11,109,6,21,Bender,Princess Num Num22524,Princess Num Num," Leela said a Rumbledy-Hump no-no!
",35,109,6,21,Leela,Humplings22525,Humplings,"  Sometimes, when we're mad,
We say words that are bad.
",56,109,6,21,Princess Num Num,Humplings22526,Humplings,"  And poo-poo and pee-pee and penis and gay.
Those are the ninety-eight words we don't say.
",92,109,6,21,Humplings,Bender22527,Bender," My God. You stole all your ideas from those poor, innocent creatures and hogged all the credit?! I underestimated you.
",120,109,6,21,Humplings,Leela22528,Leela," Wait! I can explain.
",22,109,6,21,Bender,Bender22529,Bender," Nah, don't ruin it. I'm lovin' the hypocrisy. It's like catchin' an evangelist in a whorehouse. That was the best Christmas ever.
",131,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22530,Leela," You know I hate lying. But those orphans were so proud of me, I couldn't bear to let them down.
",97,109,6,21,Bender,Bender22531,Bender," Pfff! At least Reverend Pickens had the dignity to jump out the whorehouse window with his pants around his ankles.
",117,109,6,21,Leela,Princess Num Num22532,Princess Num Num," Who's your friend, Leela? He sure has a shiny metal bumbledy-boop.
",68,109,6,21,Bender,Bender22533,Bender," Aw, they're so cute and harmless. No wonder you feel safe rippin' off their act.
",82,109,6,21,Princess Num Num,Leela22534,Leela," Bender! I feel bad enough already.
",36,109,6,21,Bender,Bender22535,Bender," I'm just messin' with ya. I love that you're gettin' rich off of them. 'Cause, now, I can get rich off of you!
",112,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22536,Leela," Oh, Lord.
",11,109,6,21,Bender,Bender22537,Bender," From now on, you give me half the gross or I'll blow your cover.
",66,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22538,Leela," Fine. You'll get your cut. I don't really care about the money, anyway. I just wanna show those poor, disadvantaged orphans that they can succeed in life.
",156,109,6,21,Bender,Bender22539,Bender," Ugh. You are the worst kind of rich person.
",45,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22540,Leela,"  Be it parsnips or peppers or kale or zucchini.
",49,109,6,21,Bender,Fry22541,Fry,"  I like to relax with a spinach martini.
",42,109,6,21,Leela,Bender22542,Bender,"  A-gurgle bufwoozle didoodi houdini.
",38,109,6,21,Fry,All22543,All,"  'Cause we love our vegetables.
",33,109,6,21,Bender,Abner Doubledeal22544,Abner Doubledeal," And... Cut! That's a wrap, everybody. Ten-minute break, then we shoot season three.
",85,109,6,21,All,Fry22545,Fry," Leela, you may have become a Lady Gaga-esque fame hag, but you sure cheered up those orphans. Nice job.
",105,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Warden Vogel22546,Warden Vogel," Thanks so much for inviting us to the taping. The kids haven't been this excited since food day!
",98,109,6,21,Fry,Leela22547,Leela," Aw, thanks. They're my inspiration.
",37,109,6,21,Warden Vogel,Bender22548,Bender," But not your only inspiration. Am I right, Leels?
",51,109,6,21,Leela,Albert22549,Albert," Is somebody standing on me?
",29,109,6,21,Bender,Bender22550,Bender," I do love inconveniencing the underclass.
",43,109,6,21,Albert,Warden Vogel22551,Warden Vogel," Well, we'll be on our way. After we dig through your trash for aluminum. Okay, kids. Delta pattern. Go! Go! Go!
",113,109,6,21,Bender,Sally22552,Sally," Miss Leela?
",13,109,6,21,Warden Vogel,Leela22553,Leela," Yes, Sally?
",13,109,6,21,Sally,Sally22554,Sally," I wanna show you the story I made up. That's Gum Drop, Sticky, Candy Corn, Sour Ball, and Jujube. They're brothers and sisters and they live in Butterscotch Hollow.
",166,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22555,Leela," Sally, that's wonderful. You came up with that yourself? Out of thin air? How?
",80,109,6,21,Sally,Sally22556,Sally," You were an orphan and now you're the best writer ever, so I knew I could write too. Thank you for being my hero.
",115,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22557,Leela," I can't do this any more.
",27,109,6,21,Sally,Farnsworth22558,Farnsworth," I don't blame you. Having to wear a costume made from a hollowed-out walrus...
",80,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22559,Leela," Everyone, I have a confession. I, Turanga Leela, winner of a Young People's Choice Award, a Peabody Jr, and two Training Emmys, am not what I appear to be. There's something I need to show you.
",195,109,6,21,Farnsworth,Bender22560,Bender," Uh-oh.
",8,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22561,Leela," Continuing my confession, this is the hardest thing I've ever done.
",69,109,6,21,Bender,Sally22562,Sally," Harder than creating the bestest show in the world?
",53,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22563,Leela," I didn't create anything. I stole it.
",39,109,6,21,Sally,Bender22564,Bender," Stealin' is a form of creativity!
",35,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22565,Leela," No, it isn't. Guys! Come on out!
",34,109,6,21,Bender,Abner Doubledeal22566,Abner Doubledeal," Holy moly again.
",18,109,6,21,Leela,Lady Buggle22567,Lady Buggle," Oh, hello, Leela. I was just telling my friends how they shouldn't eat food off the floor. Should we sing a song about it?
",124,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Fry22568,Fry," Yes, please!
",14,109,6,21,Lady Buggle,Leela22569,Leela," No need, Lady Buggle.
",23,109,6,21,Fry,Abner Doubledeal22570,Abner Doubledeal," Say, what's goin' on here?
",28,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22571,Leela," This planet is the real Rumbledy-Hump. And these creatures are the real Humplings. All I did was write down their adorably repetitious hijinks.
",145,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Sally22572,Sally," You lied? Like Doingg did when he stole Garbly's pet pinecone?
",64,109,6,21,Leela,Doingg22573,Doingg," You told them about that?
",27,109,6,21,Sally,Leela22574,Leela," I should've told the truth right away. These simply prairie folk have a simple prairie-ish life here. And I was wrong to exploit it for profit.
",145,109,6,21,Doingg,Lady Buggle22575,Lady Buggle," I'm as sad as an upside-down smile.
",37,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22576,Leela," You mean a frown?
",19,109,6,21,Lady Buggle,Lady Buggle22577,Lady Buggle," We didn't have a word for it... Until now.
",44,109,6,21,Leela,Amy22578,Amy," To think I put on an unflattering cupcake costume for you!
",60,109,6,21,Lady Buggle,Fry22579,Fry," To think I borrowed money from you!
",37,109,6,21,Amy,Albert22580,Albert," I was gonna ask you to marry me.
",34,109,6,21,Fry,Sally22581,Sally," I guess, if you can't make up stories, I can't neither.
",57,109,6,21,Albert,Leela22582,Leela," I deserve this. And more. Keep it coming!
",43,109,6,21,Sally,Abner Doubledeal22583,Abner Doubledeal," Wait a second. As a big Hollywood TV producer, I think I know how to remedy this ethical lapse.
",97,109,6,21,Leela,Lady Buggle22584,Lady Buggle,"  So if you don't want a tapeworm or intestinal bug...
",55,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Humplings22585,Humplings,"  Don't eat pastrami that fell on the rug.
",43,109,6,21,Lady Buggle,Abner Doubledeal22586,Abner Doubledeal," And... Cut! Ta-da! We got us a reality show! No writers. No actors. No problem.
",81,109,6,21,Humplings,Leela22587,Leela," Doubledeal, this is disgraceful! You can't just rip off their real lives and put it on TV!
",92,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Abner Doubledeal22588,Abner Doubledeal," Wha? Who said anything about rippin' them off?
",48,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22589,Leela," I did!
",8,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Abner Doubledeal22590,Abner Doubledeal," I'm payin' 'em. Gather 'round, gang. Here're your pay checks.
",63,109,6,21,Leela,Garbly22591,Garbly,"  I can finally afford my speech therapy!
",42,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Feffernoose22592,Feffernoose," And the health plan covers my generic Prozac!
",47,109,6,21,Garbly,Lady Buggle22593,Lady Buggle," Electricity, plumbing... Our lives are a jillion times better. And it's all thanks to you, Leela.
",99,109,6,21,Feffernoose,Leela22594,Leela," Don't thank me! I should be punished! I've corrupted you and taught the orphans a terrible lesson.
",100,109,6,21,Lady Buggle,Warden Vogel22595,Warden Vogel," What orphans?! The kids were all adopted!
",43,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22596,Leela," They were?! By who?!
",22,109,6,21,Warden Vogel,Abner Doubledeal22597,Abner Doubledeal," Come on, kids. Let's get this place cleaned up for the next episode. Albert, pick up that pastrami and put it back on the craft services table.
",145,109,6,21,Leela,Albert22598,Albert," You're the boss, Daddy.
",25,109,6,21,Abner Doubledeal,Leela22599,Leela," Oh, God! What have I done?!
",29,109,6,21,Albert,Nina22600,Nina," You've given us a new father and a full-time job! Which is more than most kids have!
",86,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22601,Leela," Butâ€”
",6,109,6,21,Nina,Sally22602,Sally," We love it here, Miss Leela. This is the funnest planet in the whole world!
",77,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22603,Leela," Don't hug me! I've done a horrible thing! For God's sakes, somebody teach me a lesson!
",88,109,6,21,Sally,Orphans and Humplings22604,Orphans and Humplings,"  We love Leela!
",17,109,6,21,Leela,Leela22605,Leela,"  No!
",6,109,6,21,Orphans and Humplings,Fry22606,Fry," Run, Leela! They're bouncing right at us!
",43,110,6,22,Leela,Bender22607,Bender," So... Anybody hungry?
",23,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22608,Fry," I could stuff myself.
",23,110,6,22,Bender,Leela22609,Leela," I'll use that free app that tells you what restaurants you're near.
",69,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22610,Fry," You mean the window?
",22,110,6,22,Leela,Leela22611,Leela," Yes.
",6,110,6,22,Fry,Lrrr22612,Lrrr,"  I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8! I demand extra dipping sauce!
",81,110,6,22,Leela,Teenaged Alien22613,Teenaged Alien," How many?
",11,110,6,22,Lrrr,Lrrr22614,Lrrr,"  Uh... Two.
",13,110,6,22,Teenaged Alien,Fishy Joe22615,Fishy Joe," Welcome to Fishy Joe's. Today is Stroganoff Thursday. We are currently out of the following menu items.
",105,110,6,22,Lrrr,Female Voice22616,Female Voice," Stroganoff.
",13,110,6,22,Fishy Joe,Teenaged Alien22617,Teenaged Alien," May I take your order?
",24,110,6,22,Female Voice,Fry22618,Fry," I'll have the Stroganoff.
",27,110,6,22,Teenaged Alien,Teenaged Alien22619,Teenaged Alien," Okay.
",7,110,6,22,Fry,Bender22620,Bender," Yeah, uh, gimme the fried spaghetti dinner breakfast pocket for lunch an', uh, a big bucket o' mixed sodas.
",109,110,6,22,Teenaged Alien,Teenaged Alien22621,Teenaged Alien," One kids meal. Got it.
",24,110,6,22,Bender,Leela22622,Leela,"  Huh. Buggalo tots?
",21,110,6,22,Teenaged Alien,Leela22623,Leela," What exactly are those made of?
",33,110,6,22,Leela,Teenaged Alien22624,Teenaged Alien," You got a warrant?
",20,110,6,22,Leela,Leela22625,Leela," I'll just have something from the lite menu. How about the gardener lover's salad?
",84,110,6,22,Teenaged Alien,Teenaged Alien22626,Teenaged Alien," What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?
",45,110,6,22,Leela,Leela22627,Leela," Ugh! Just gimme the fruit cup!
",32,110,6,22,Teenaged Alien,Teenaged Alien22628,Teenaged Alien," Okey-doke. What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?
",56,110,6,22,Leela,Leela22629,Leela," Oh, God! Fruit is spelled F-R-O-O-T. And it's got quotation marks around it.
",78,110,6,22,Teenaged Alien,Fry22630,Fry," Mmm. There's nothin' wrong with a little fast food once or twice a meal. Heart... Attack! I'm fine.
",101,110,6,22,Leela,Leela22631,Leela," Oh! I got a bone in my fruit! That's it. From now on, we're not eating anything unless we know what it is an' where it's from. We're going to the local farmers market.
",169,110,6,22,Fry,Bender22632,Bender," Aw, mom! Do we hafta?!
",24,110,6,22,Leela,Leela22633,Leela," This is what I'm talkin' about! See all the dirt an' earwigs? That's the sign of healthy food.
",96,110,6,22,Bender,Hydroponic Farmer22634,Hydroponic Farmer," You think that's healthy? Try this. I found it growin' at the bottom of my hamper.
",84,110,6,22,Leela,Leela22635,Leela," Mmm! So fresh an' musty!
",26,110,6,22,Hydroponic Farmer,Bulb22636,Bulb," It's what I do.
",17,110,6,22,Leela,Thog22637,Thog," Hello, tiny man. You want sample small-batch Amazonian maple syrup?
",69,110,6,22,Bulb,Fry22638,Fry," Sure. That's the kinda sap I like.
",36,110,6,22,Thog,Thog22639,Thog," You the kind of sap I like.
",29,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22640,Fry," I'm scaroused!
",16,110,6,22,Thog,Bender22641,Bender," Zuban tobacco?! The richest, most obnoxious kind! Listen, pal. I'm lookin' for a versatile smoke. One that's equally good in a crowded elevator or an audience with the Pope.
",175,110,6,22,Fry,Moustached Alien22642,Moustached Alien," Forget the Pope, my friend. Smoke one of these and God himself will ask to be seated far away from you.
",105,110,6,22,Bender,Bender22643,Bender," Ooh!
",6,110,6,22,Moustached Alien,Leela22644,Leela," Heirloom eggs?! That's so life-affirming! I'll bet you run your own hatchery. Just you and your wife... Matilda.
",114,110,6,22,Bender,Brown-haired man22645,Brown-haired man," No, ma'am. Matilda an' I gather them eggs in the forest. And Matilda's really more of a mongoose than a wife.
",111,110,6,22,Leela,Leela22646,Leela," You're a lucky man. But are they way more expensive than regular eggs?
",72,110,6,22,Brown-haired man,Brown-haired Man #122647,Brown-haired Man #1," Way more.
",11,110,6,22,Leela,Leela22648,Leela," Ooh! I'll take a dozen.
",25,110,6,22,Brown-haired Man #1,Farnsworth22649,Farnsworth," Wha?! You're not my breakfast friends! What are you doing here?!
",66,110,6,22,Leela,Amy22650,Amy," Leela blackmailed us all into eating healthy, organic food.
",61,110,6,22,Farnsworth,Farnsworth22651,Farnsworth," Blackmail? What does she have on you?
",39,110,6,22,Amy,Hermes22652,Hermes," As long as we eat 'er filthy scrambled eggs, you'll never find out.
",69,110,6,22,Farnsworth,Leela22653,Leela," They're not filthy! They're wholesome, fertile, and fresh from the forest floor. There's some filth.
",102,110,6,22,Hermes,Fry22654,Fry," FERTILE? What does that mean?
",31,110,6,22,Leela,Zoidberg22655,Zoidberg," It means it'll hatch into a tiny, little infant creature. Unless we cook it first. Hey, Leela! Hurry up with those scrambled infants!
",135,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22656,Fry," What?! That's horrifying! Zoidberg, you're an in-Human monster.
",65,110,6,22,Zoidberg,Zoidberg22657,Zoidberg," What are you? My driver's license?
",36,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22658,Fry," Eating a sweet, innocent chick before it's even hatched?! Oh-ho-ho-ho, no, you won'tn't! I refuse to eat an unborn animal! I'm gonna keep this egg safe and warm and secure. Until it hatches out into the world. And then I'm gonna eat it!
",238,110,6,22,Zoidberg,Leela22659,Leela," Should we turn on the TV?
",27,110,6,22,Fry,Hermes22660,Hermes," Nah.
",6,110,6,22,Leela,Fry22661,Fry," Bender, d'you mind? I'm roosting.
",35,110,6,22,Hermes,Bender22662,Bender," I'm considerin' buyin' a yacht to house my Thoroughbreds. How d'you expect me to do that without smokin' a cigar?
",115,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22663,Fry," Think of the unborn embryo!
",29,110,6,22,Bender,Bender22664,Bender," That's what I'm gonna call the yacht. Stop pickin' me! Whoa!
",62,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22665,Fry," Hey! Leggo my egg-o, crab-o!
",30,110,6,22,Bender,Hermes22666,Hermes," Stop it, Fry! That's sexual harassment!
",41,110,6,22,Fry,Zoidberg22667,Zoidberg," Yeah, come down off your round, white pulpit! You're just gonna eat that thing, anyway!
",89,110,6,22,Hermes,Fry22668,Fry," I was, but you can't sit on something for a week without falling in love with it. Whoever's in here deserves a chance at life. A chance to blossom into a beautiful young man. Like I did as a baby. And so I make this solemn vow... To do everything I can to make sure this wonderful, innocent creature enters this world happy, healthy, an'â€” All yours, Zoidberg.
",361,110,6,22,Zoidberg,Bender22669,Bender," Aw! Look at the cute, littleâ€” I was gonna go yachting in those feet!
",70,110,6,22,Fry,Leela22670,Leela," Relax, you babies. It's no different from stomping a puppy.
",61,110,6,22,Bender,Fry22671,Fry," Everyone stop! He's not gonna hurt you.
",41,110,6,22,Leela,Bender22672,Bender," I'm standin' in a pool of my own feet!
",40,110,6,22,Fry,Hermes22673,Hermes," Bender's right! Kill it before someone names it!
",50,110,6,22,Bender,Fry22674,Fry," No! Mr. Peppy just wants to be our friend.
",44,110,6,22,Hermes,Hermes22675,Hermes," Oy!
",5,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22676,Fry," Look: I know 'e's ugly and kinda corrosive, but we can't murder someone just 'cause he's hideous an' annoying.
",112,110,6,22,Hermes,Amy22677,Amy," That's what we said about Zoidberg and look what that got us.
",63,110,6,22,Fry,Zoidberg22678,Zoidberg," Amy has a point.
",18,110,6,22,Amy,Fry22679,Fry," Mr. Peppy's not like Zoidberg. He's my friend.
",48,110,6,22,Zoidberg,Zoidberg22680,Zoidberg," Aw!
",5,110,6,22,Fry,Calculon22681,Calculon," Where to... Adulterers?
",25,110,6,22,Zoidberg,Monique22682,Monique," Calculon?! Then it wasn't your body they found in the harbor after the bomb went off.
",87,110,6,22,Calculon,Calculon22683,Calculon," What bomb?
",12,110,6,22,Monique,Bender22684,Bender," It takes more than that to surprise me, Bender.  What you doin', little buddy? Uh, yeah... Uncle Bender... He's your friend.  Huh? Oh, you wanna play fetch!  Come on, boy! Get the ball.  Dumb jerk. Come on! Get the ball.
",222,110,6,22,Calculon,Hermes22685,Hermes," Sweet freak of Mozambique! That thing's colossal! It's gonna kill us all!
",75,110,6,22,Bender,Amy22686,Amy," It's so huge! How big does one o' those things get?!
",54,110,6,22,Hermes,Fry22687,Fry," Well, that depends on what one o' those things is. That seems like a fact worth knowing.
",90,110,6,22,Amy,Farnsworth22688,Farnsworth," Good, startling news, everyone!
",33,110,6,22,Fry,Farnsworth22689,Farnsworth," I found a description of the creature in this medieval monster manual. Just as I feared. Attack type J.
",105,110,6,22,Farnsworth,Amy22690,Amy," No!  No!
",10,110,6,22,Farnsworth,Farnsworth22691,Farnsworth,"  Yes!  It kills its prey by sucking out the skeleton, leaving nothing but a puddle of flesh.
",94,110,6,22,Amy,Amy22692,Amy," Ew!
",5,110,6,22,Farnsworth,Leela22693,Leela," Ugh!
",6,110,6,22,Amy,Bender22694,Bender," Ew!
",5,110,6,22,Leela,Farnsworth22695,Farnsworth," Hence the Latin name bonus vampirus. Or, as you non-Catholics would say, the bone vampire!
",92,110,6,22,Bender,Zoidberg22696,Zoidberg," Dios mÃ_o.
",11,110,6,22,Farnsworth,Fry22697,Fry," That's ridiculous. Mr. Peppy doesn't eat bones. I raised 'im on a simple diet o' Brussels sprouts an' mixed soda.
",115,110,6,22,Zoidberg,Hermes22698,Hermes," At least there's only one of 'em. The good news is they can't start breedin'.
",79,110,6,22,Fry,Farnsworth22699,Farnsworth," The bad news, everyone, is the beast reproduces asexually. A single bone vampire, left alone with some quiet music and some bone-vampire porn, could produce dozens of deadly offspring.
",186,110,6,22,Hermes,Zoidberg22700,Zoidberg," That lucky bastard. I say kill it!
",36,110,6,22,Farnsworth,Fry22701,Fry," But it loves me! And I love it.
",33,110,6,22,Zoidberg,Zoidberg22702,Zoidberg," Kill 'em both!
",16,110,6,22,Fry,Leela22703,Leela," Killing them seems like a hassle. Can't we just set it free to live with its own kind?
",88,110,6,22,Zoidberg,Farnsworth22704,Farnsworth," Poor, ignorant Leela. The bone vampire is now extinct on its home planet.
",75,110,6,22,Leela,Leela22705,Leela," That's perfect! We can reintroduce it to the wild and repopulate the species!
",79,110,6,22,Farnsworth,Fry22706,Fry," Yeah! Let's do those Leela things.
",36,110,6,22,Leela,Fry22707,Fry," Well, buddy, how d'ya like your new home? See? He's happy already.
",68,110,6,22,Fry,Hermes22708,Hermes," That thing doesn't have emotions, Fry. Its brain is the size of a walnut.
",75,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22709,Fry," So are walnuts and they're delicious. I'll miss you, Mr. Peppy. But you'll be happier here. So... Go on. Go. Goodbye, Mr. Peppy. Come on, man. Don't do this. Go on now. I mean it. Don't make this any harder than it has to be. It's time to let go! Ow! Thanks, Leela. He just needed a little extra push.
",303,110,6,22,Hermes,Leela22710,Leela," Come on, Fry. Let's go home an'â€”
",34,110,6,22,Fry,Bender22711,Bender," Hold up! There's alcohol around here somewhere. My Tanqueray-dar is goin' crazy. Aha-ha! Thought you could get away from me, huh? You lose again, you stupid intoxicant!
",170,110,6,22,Leela,Zoidberg22712,Zoidberg," We're not from around here. Hello!
",36,110,6,22,Bender,Man #122713,Man #1," 
",2,110,6,22,Zoidberg,Hermes22714,Hermes," Excuse me, but we're guests on your planet. Speak English!
",60,110,6,22,Man #1,Man #1 #222715,Man #1 #2," Behave yourselves, gents. Off-worlders best be welcome here. Especially if we're trying to get the Olympics. May I buy you a drink? We don't get a lot of pretty faces around here.
",181,110,6,22,Hermes,Leela22716,Leela," Uh... Sure. But I'm driving. I'll just have the smallest whisky you've got.
",77,110,6,22,Man #1 #2,Man #1 #222717,Man #1 #2," A small aquarium o' whisky for the busty lass!
",48,110,6,22,Leela,Leela22718,Leela," Thanks. I suppose I should know your name if I'm gonna be drinking ten gallons of alcohol with you.
",101,110,6,22,Man #1 #2,Man #1 #222719,Man #1 #2," McZongo. Angus McZongo. Major Angus McZongo. Handsome Major Angus McZongo. Esquire.
",85,110,6,22,Leela,Leela22720,Leela," Ooh! Handsome and esquire. I'm Turanga Leela. My crew an' I are from Earth.
",77,110,6,22,Man #1 #2,Angus McZongo22721,Angus McZongo," So what brings you folks here to Doohan 6?
",44,110,6,22,Leela,Amy22722,Amy," We just released an endangered animal back into the wild. A bone vampire!
",75,110,6,22,Angus McZongo,Hermes22723,Hermes," No need to thank us. Your shocked stares of gratitude say it all.
",67,110,6,22,Amy,Angus McZongo22724,Angus McZongo," Dear God. You brought back the bone vampire?! The damn things wreaked bloody havoc on our livestock for centuries!
",116,110,6,22,Hermes,Woman #122725,Woman #1," Aye! Until McZongo 'ere shot 'em all into extinction, 'e did.
",63,110,6,22,Angus McZongo,Man #1 #322726,Man #1 #3," Now we've got more livestock than we can slaughter. Oh, aye. 'Tis a Bonnie time to be an ignorant villager.
",109,110,6,22,Woman #1,Man #1 #422727,Man #1 #4," We kinna have no murderin' bone vampires back 'ere!
",53,110,6,22,Man #1 #3,Man #1 #322728,Man #1 #3," Kill it afore it puts a bun in its own oven and repopulates the bleedin' planet!
",82,110,6,22,Man #1 #4,Fry22729,Fry," No!
",5,110,6,22,Man #1 #3,Angus McZongo22730,Angus McZongo," Angus is right.
",17,110,6,22,Fry,Hermes22731,Hermes," I thought you were named Angus.
",33,110,6,22,Angus McZongo,Man #122732,Man #1," We're all named Angus!
",24,110,6,22,Hermes,Fry22733,Fry," Please! Mr. Peppy won't attack your livestock. He's a vegetarian and 'e's not even preachy about it!
",102,110,6,22,Man #1,Angus McZongo22734,Angus McZongo," Poppycock. Once he gets the smell o' bones, there'll be no stoppin' 'im. Tonight, Mr. Peppy must die.
",103,110,6,22,Fry,Leela22735,Leela," Angus, wait. My strictly platonic friend is right. At least wait a few days before you decide to kill it.
",107,110,6,22,Angus McZongo,Angus McZongo22736,Angus McZongo," The last time I hesitated, a bone vampire snicked out me left shin.
",69,110,6,22,Leela,Leela22737,Leela," Please! Just a few days.
",26,110,6,22,Angus McZongo,Angus McZongo22738,Angus McZongo," Well, 'twould give us a chance to get to know each other. The beast lives! For now.
",85,110,6,22,Leela,Leela22739,Leela," Thank you, Angus.
",19,110,6,22,Angus McZongo,Men22740,Men,"  You're welcome!
",18,110,6,22,Leela,Fry22741,Fry," I don't trust that McZongo. Maybe I should go keep an eye on Mr. Peppy.
",73,110,6,22,Men,Leela22742,Leela," Don't worry about McZongo. He an' I are having brunch tomorrow. I'm thinking of wearing this.
",95,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22743,Fry," It's nice! But there's still somethin' I don't like about that guy. My dad always said you could tell a lot about a man by the rigidity of 'is shins.
",151,110,6,22,Leela,Zoidberg22744,Zoidberg," What is?!
",11,110,6,22,Fry,Man #122745,Man #1," UNKNOWN, Gryffindor, Slytherin an' Hufflepuff! It killed Little Angus!
",72,110,6,22,Zoidberg,Farnsworth22746,Farnsworth," They're all dead! And their bones are gone! This was no accident.
",67,110,6,22,Man #1,Angus McZongo22747,Angus McZongo," Still think your Mr. Peppy is harmless, Fry?
",46,110,6,22,Farnsworth,Fry22748,Fry," He wouldn't do this in our sleep. He would not, could not to a sheep.
",71,110,6,22,Angus McZongo,Angus McZongo22749,Angus McZongo," The deal is off! The beast must die!
",38,110,6,22,Fry,Bender22750,Bender," Ooh! Pimpy!
",13,110,6,22,Angus McZongo,Fry22751,Fry," What are we supposed to do? Just sit here and wait for Mr. Peppy to be killed?
",80,110,6,22,Bender,Bender22752,Bender," Sounds like a plan! Guess I'll pass the time by lightin' up an El Jerko!
",74,110,6,22,Fry,Leela22753,Leela," Okay! That's it! I need some air.
",35,110,6,22,Bender,Leela22754,Leela," Who's there? Hermes, is this one o' your zany practical jokes?
",64,110,6,22,Leela,Fry22755,Fry," Leela, are you okay? Did you drink too many aquaria?
",54,110,6,22,Leela,Hermes22756,Hermes," Look! The bone vampire!
",25,110,6,22,Fry,Leela22757,Leela," Mr. Peppy attacked me. Quick! Count my bones. There should be two-hundred-and-five!
",85,110,6,22,Hermes,Leela22758,Leela," Okay. That's better. Keep 'em comin'!
",39,110,6,22,Leela,Farnsworth22759,Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Fry, but no vegetarian could've done this.
",55,110,6,22,Leela,Fry22760,Fry," I know. An', as much as I love Mr. Peppy, I love Leela more. He has to be... Put down.
",88,110,6,22,Farnsworth,Amy22761,Amy," Aw, don't feel bad. Major McZongo's an experienced hunter. He'll blow Mr. Peppy's head off as painlessly as possible.
",119,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22762,Fry," No! Not McZongo! If anyone's gonna kill Mr. Peppy, it should be me.
",69,110,6,22,Amy,Zoidberg22763,Zoidberg," Fry, I know you're upset right now, but I hope you'll consider donating the body to science dinner.
",101,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22764,Fry," Here, Mr. Peppy. Mmm. Lovely bones.
",37,110,6,22,Zoidberg,Hermes22765,Hermes," We've been walkin' for hours. I hope we can find our way back.
",64,110,6,22,Fry,Amy22766,Amy," Don't worry. I left a trail of bread crumbs.
",46,110,6,22,Hermes,Bender22767,Bender," An' I left a trail of cigars!
",31,110,6,22,Amy,Leela22768,Leela," You don't have to do this, Fry. Mr. Peppy just gave me a little love concussion.
",82,110,6,22,Bender,Fry22769,Fry," Thanks, Leela, but I have no choice. I can't let my monstruous deboner get anywhere near you.
",95,110,6,22,Leela,Hermes22770,Hermes," There it is!
",14,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22771,Fry," Well, this is it. You guys wait here. This is gonna kill him more than it does me. Goodbye, boy. I'll think of you whenever I sit on something round.
",151,110,6,22,Hermes,Amy22772,Amy," What's happening?! Did you kill it?!
",38,110,6,22,Fry,Mr. Peppy22773,Mr. Peppy," The bloody idiot bloody-shot me! I'm all bloody-bloody!
",57,110,6,22,Amy,Bender22774,Bender," Wha?!
",7,110,6,22,Mr. Peppy,Fry22775,Fry," Mr. Peppy?! Bullets make you talk?!
",37,110,6,22,Bender,Bender22776,Bender," That's not Mr. Peppy!
",23,110,6,22,Fry,Amy22777,Amy," Jinkies! He Scooby-Doo-ed us!
",31,110,6,22,Bender,Leela22778,Leela," Why, Major McZongo? Why?
",26,110,6,22,Amy,Angus McZongo22779,Angus McZongo," Oh, it's been thirty years since last I killed a bone vampire. The villagers dinna idolise me like they used to.
",114,110,6,22,Leela,Amy22780,Amy," You seem pretty popular at the pub.
",37,110,6,22,Angus McZongo,Angus McZongo22781,Angus McZongo," I work there as a greeter! Your beast was my chance to be a hero again. But the damn thing was a vegetarian! So I slaughtered the sheep meself.
",145,110,6,22,Amy,Leela22782,Leela," But why did you attack me?
",28,110,6,22,Angus McZongo,Angus McZongo22783,Angus McZongo," So I could impress you by seeking revenge on the creature. Us greeters don't get a lot of action. On paper, it seemed like a win-win situation.
",145,110,6,22,Leela,Farnsworth22784,Farnsworth," Do you realise what this means, Fry?! Your pet's not dangerous after all!
",75,110,6,22,Angus McZongo,Fry22785,Fry," I told ya! Mr. Peppy's a lover, not a fighter. Like Dwayne ""The Rock"" ""The Tooth Fairy"" Johnson.
",98,110,6,22,Farnsworth,Zoidberg22786,Zoidberg," UNKNOWN! Hey. What's that bone-sucking sound?
",47,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22787,Fry," It's Mr. Peppy! I'd know 'im anywhere.
",40,110,6,22,Zoidberg,Leela22788,Leela," Huh. So, apparently, Major McZongo and Mr. Peppy were each doing about half the sheep killing.
",96,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22789,Fry," Why, Mr. Peppy? Why? Ooh. That tickles. Now I really do have to kill you.
",75,110,6,22,Leela,Man #1 #322790,Man #1 #3," Wait! Don't shoot. The beast is a godsend. Like I said, we've more livestock than we can slaughter. But, thanks to this ravenous bogle, that's nae more a problem.
",164,110,6,22,Fry,Man #1 #522791,Man #1 #5," Angus is right. The cursed thing even debones 'em. Which is perfect for today's fast-paced, lazy consumer.
",108,110,6,22,Man #1 #3,Man #122792,Man #1," Dersu Uzala, Yojimbo, Rashomon! The beast must live!
",54,110,6,22,Man #1 #5,Leela22793,Leela," You know what the best part is? From now on, whenever we're eating fresh, organic space meat, we'll know exactly where it comes from.
",135,110,6,22,Man #1,Fry22794,Fry," One bucket o' double-friend, triple-salted, boneless sheep tots, please.
",74,110,6,22,Leela,Teenaged Alien22795,Teenaged Alien," What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?
",45,110,6,22,Fry,Fry22796,Fry," All kinds.
",12,110,6,22,Teenaged Alien,Leela22797,Leela," Eh... Make it two.
",20,110,6,22,Fry,Leela22798,Leela,"  An' a small whisky. Large.
",29,110,6,22,Leela,Farnsworth22799,Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Remember when you asked to see my family tree?
",69,111,6,23,Leela,"Leela, Bender, Zoidberg, Hermes, Amy, and Fry"22800,"Leela, Bender, Zoidberg, Hermes, Amy, and Fry"," No.

And here's Dean Farnsworth, developer of the Farnsworth test for colour blindness.  Where is he, blast it?!

",103,111,6,23,Leela,Amy22804,Amy," What about Fry?  Isn't he your distant uncle?
",47,111,6,23,Farnsworth,Farnsworth22805,Farnsworth," Very distant. Not a true Farnsworth, mind you.  He's way over here on this filthy branch riddled with fungus and dung beetles.
",128,111,6,23,Amy,Fry22806,Fry," What's with the seventeen dung beetles?

",38,112,6,24,Yancy FrySr,Yancy FryJr23068,Yancy FryJr," Some stupid science contest for smart wads.  NASA's gonna pick one kid's experiment to launch into space.

",38,112,6,24,Fry,Fry23076,Fry," It's nothing.  Just a common cold.

",32,112,6,24,Hermes,Bender23081,Bender," Is it valuable? Could it be taken from you if you were, say...  Unconscious?
",78,112,6,24,Leela,Farnsworth23082,Farnsworth," A commonâ€”  A common cold?! No!   No!   Ever since Fry first came to us, I've lived in mortal terror that this would happen!
",125,112,6,24,Bender,Leela23083,Leela," I never heard you mention that.
",33,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23084,Farnsworth,"  Oh, I try to act cool, but inside I'm  freaking out!
",55,112,6,24,Leela,Fry23085,Fry," It's just a cold!  What's the big deal?

",100,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23092,Farnsworth," No, it won't!  The common cold died out five-hundred years ago. And, subsequently, Humanity lost all resistance to its ravages. But the virus survived in you...   Frozen for a thousand years.
",193,112,6,24,Fry,Fry23093,Fry," Huh.  So it was hiding deep down inside o' me? Like my skeleton bones?
",72,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Leela23094,Leela," Give it to us straight, Professor. How incredibly deadly is it?
",65,112,6,24,Fry,Farnsworth23095,Farnsworth,"  We don't know.  It could kill millions or nobody. I suppose it might even bring a few people back to life!  Anything is possible in science.
",143,112,6,24,Leela,Amy23096,Amy," Oh, no!  I've got it too!  My nose is all gunked up with blork!

",31,112,6,24,Hermes,Morbo23151,Morbo,"  The situation is expected to deteriorate as newscasters whip the city into a panic.
",86,112,6,24,Fry,Morbo23152,Morbo," Run! Run for your lives!
",26,112,6,24,Morbo,Linda23153,Linda," And, finally, the heart-warming story of a handicapped magician who didn't know when to give up.
",98,112,6,24,Morbo,Zapp23154,Zapp," I don't like the looks of this, Mr. President.  Shall I switch it off?
",72,112,6,24,Linda,Richard Nixons head23155,Richard Nixons head," Negative.  Rose Mary, release the Surgeon General!
",52,112,6,24,Zapp,Woman #123156,Woman #1,"  Get in there!
",16,112,6,24,Richard Nixons head,Wernstrom23157,Wernstrom," Ow!  It's bright out here.
",28,112,6,24,Woman #1,Richard Nixons head23158,Richard Nixons head," Wernstrom...  The quarantine 'as failed. Give me a worst-case scenario. And make it grim.
",91,112,6,24,Wernstrom,Wernstrom23159,Wernstrom," I've prepared some projections.  Should the virus escape Manhattan, this is how far it will spread in twelve hours.  This is twenty-four hours.  This is a Verizon coverage map.  And, in thirty-six hours, it will have infected the entire planet!
",246,112,6,24,Richard Nixons head,Richard Nixons head23160,Richard Nixons head," Options?
",10,112,6,24,Wernstrom,Zapp23161,Zapp," We 'ave only one option.  Protocol sixty-two.
",47,112,6,24,Richard Nixons head,Richard Nixons head23162,Richard Nixons head," Not possible. We don't 'ave nearly enough piranhas!
",53,112,6,24,Zapp,Zapp23163,Zapp," Then protocol sixty-three it is.
",34,112,6,24,Richard Nixons head,Hermes23164,Hermes," Hooray!  They're letting us out!
",34,112,6,24,Zapp,Zoidberg23165,Zoidberg," And hundreds of black hovercopters are coming to welcome us!
",62,112,6,24,Hermes,Hermes23166,Hermes," They shrink-wrapped the hole city! Well, it could be worse.  It is worse!
",75,112,6,24,Zoidberg,Zoidberg23167,Zoidberg," They're flying Manhattan into the Sun!  They must've been outta piranhas.
",75,112,6,24,Hermes,Hermes23168,Hermes," They're gonna kill the virus by exposing it to the heat of our burning bodies!
",80,112,6,24,Zoidberg,Farnsworth23169,Farnsworth," I'm just glad I have my wool scarf.
",37,112,6,24,Hermes,Fry23170,Fry," What good is a woolâ€”
",22,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Bender23171,Bender," Guys! Guys! You're never gonna believe this!
",46,112,6,24,Fry,Amy23172,Amy," We know! They shmooped up Manhattan and blasted us toward the Sun!
",68,112,6,24,Bender,Bender23173,Bender," They did? Aw!  So that's why this was unguarded.
",50,112,6,24,Amy,Wernstrom23174,Wernstrom," People of New New York, this is Surgeon General Ogden Vernstrom.
",66,112,6,24,Bender,Farnsworth23175,Farnsworth," Wern--strom!
",14,112,6,24,Wernstrom,Wernstrom23176,Wernstrom," No doctor likes hurling his patients into the Sun, but, since there is no way to make a vaccine for the common coldâ€”
",118,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23177,Farnsworth," There is a way to make a vaccine!
",35,112,6,24,Wernstrom,Fry23178,Fry," There is?   Yay!
",18,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23179,Farnsworth," Of course, there's a catch.
",29,112,6,24,Fry,Fry23180,Fry,"  Woo!
",7,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Fry23181,Fry,"  Woo!  Yay! Yay!  So what's the catch?
",40,112,6,24,Fry,Farnsworth23182,Farnsworth," The vaccine requires the original, unmutated, 20th-century cold virus. So I need to grind you into a paste.
",109,112,6,24,Fry,Leela23183,Leela," Professor, no!
",16,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Fry23184,Fry," It's okay, Leela. This is all my fault, sort of. If this will save you, then, please, turn me into a virus milkshake.
",119,112,6,24,Leela,Farnsworth23185,Farnsworth," He consented!  You all heard it!
",34,112,6,24,Fry,Yancy FrySr23186,Yancy FrySr," Yes, sir. Many of these entries merit a ride in the mighty bosom of our space shuttle.  And then there's your so-called entry.
",128,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Fry23187,Fry," Jeez!  Walk much, Gedgie?!
",28,112,6,24,Yancy FrySr,Josh Gedgie23188,Josh Gedgie," Absurd. You really think your guinea pig could survive in the vacuum of space?
",80,112,6,24,Fry,Fry23189,Fry," He already survived in the vacuum of my mom.  I mean, ""My mom's vacuum.""
",74,112,6,24,Josh Gedgie,Josh Gedgie23190,Josh Gedgie," My experiment measures the effects of microgravity of the propagation of the common cold virus in an anaerobic environment; i.e., space.  Impressed?
",150,112,6,24,Fry,Yancy FrySr23191,Yancy FrySr," Damn right I am.  That's some dry, emotionless science.  Nice job, son.
",73,112,6,24,Josh Gedgie,Fry23192,Fry," Hey, wait a second!  I know where you can get some 20th-century cold virus without killing me!
",96,112,6,24,Yancy FrySr,Farnsworth23193,Farnsworth," Hush, lad.  I'm totally in the zone.
",38,112,6,24,Fry,Fry23194,Fry," We just 'ave to find the Nerd Search '88 satellite!
",53,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23195,Farnsworth,"  I don't know why I even build these things.
",46,112,6,24,Fry,Leela23196,Leela," Gunnery Chief Bender, blast us out of quarantine.
",51,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Bender23197,Bender," Aye, aye, lady.
",17,112,6,24,Leela,Farnsworth23198,Farnsworth," Oh, fiddlepoop! Our weapons aren't strong enough to puncture a thin plastic tent that thick?!
",95,112,6,24,Bender,Leela23199,Leela," No. But theirs are!
",21,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Kif23200,Kif," Captain, a ship is attempting to break the quarantine.
",56,112,6,24,Leela,Zapp23201,Zapp," Blow them to baco bits with a well placed warning shot!
",57,112,6,24,Kif,Kif23202,Kif," Butâ€”
",6,112,6,24,Zapp,Zapp23203,Zapp," Oops.
",7,112,6,24,Kif,Fry23204,Fry," We'll find that cold virus.  The Nerd Search satellite was launched on the space shuttle and released into orbit.
",115,112,6,24,Zapp,Leela23205,Leela," Hmmm. All ancient satellites were swept up as space junk in 2113.  I actually knew that offhand.  I'm Facebooking right now.
",126,112,6,24,Fry,Farnsworth23206,Farnsworth," Aha!  That satellite was scuttled on Enceladus, Saturn's main dump moon!
",74,112,6,24,Leela,Fry23207,Fry," Let's dump it up!
",19,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Leela23208,Leela," This is the exact location of the dump.  But there's nothing here.
",68,112,6,24,Fry,Bender23209,Bender," Can we please go home an' die now?
",36,112,6,24,Leela,Farnsworth23210,Farnsworth," I'm with Bender.  Whatever was here's been covered by centuries of ice buildup.
",81,112,6,24,Bender,Fry23211,Fry," No!  It's under here somewhere. We just 'ave to bust our way down.  Remember the code of the ice. Thin an' crispy, way too risky.
",131,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Leela23212,Leela,"  I found a satellite!
",23,112,6,24,Fry,Fry23213,Fry," Let's just hope the experiment's still in here.  Yes! We're saved!
",68,112,6,24,Leela,Man #123214,Man #1," And now, to present the awards, our very special guest.  He walked on the Moon and now he is judging a high-school science contest.  Truly a man who can and will do anything... Dr. Buzz Aldrin!
",195,112,6,24,Fry,Buzz Aldrin23215,Buzz Aldrin," Wow!  I could've used an introduction like that when I first met the Moon men!  But, seriously, there are Moon men.  Okay. This year's Nerd Search runner-up is a young man who devised a way to add and subtract in zero gravity.  Vijay Patel and his calculator space hat!
",271,112,6,24,Man #1,Vijai Patel23216,Vijai Patel,"  Woo!  Woo!
",13,112,6,24,Buzz Aldrin,Buzz Aldrin23217,Buzz Aldrin," And now the grand-prize winner whose experiment will be launched into space.
",78,112,6,24,Vijai Patel,Yancy FrySr23218,Yancy FrySr,"  Look at that cocky smirk.   My money's on Gedgie.
",52,112,6,24,Buzz Aldrin,Fry23219,Fry," Yeah? He may 'ave brains, but I 'ave heart.
",45,112,6,24,Yancy FrySr,Buzz Aldrin23220,Buzz Aldrin," Josh Gedgie!
",14,112,6,24,Fry,Yancy FrySr23221,Yancy FrySr," I'll bring the car around.
",28,112,6,24,Buzz Aldrin,Farnsworth23222,Farnsworth," What a well prepared virus culture.  This will make a fine vaccine.
",69,112,6,24,Yancy FrySr,Fry23223,Fry," Good thing Gedgie won. My dumb experiment wouldn't've lasted an hour in space, let alone a thousand years. Besides, Buzz Aldrin ran over my guinea pig in the parking lot.
",172,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23224,Farnsworth," Eh, okay. Uh, come on, gang. Let's go inoculate everyone and cram Manhattan back into its rightful hole!
",106,112,6,24,Fry,Farnsworth23225,Farnsworth," This may hurt a little.
",25,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Wernstrom23226,Wernstrom," Ow!
",5,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23227,Farnsworth," Now, I'll give you the shot.
",30,112,6,24,Wernstrom,Leela23228,Leela," You saved millions of lives, Fry. You should feel proud. No matter what your dad said to you.
",95,112,6,24,Farnsworth,Yancy FrySr23229,Yancy FrySr," You still 'aven't thanked me for pullin' you outta the lake, soldier.
",71,112,6,24,Leela,Fry23230,Fry," I could've flip-flopped out.
",30,112,6,24,Yancy FrySr,Yancy FrySr23231,Yancy FrySr," I know that.  Look, son.  I know I give you the business sometimes.  But, if I'm hard on you, it's only 'cause I want you to grow up strong and resilient.  Someday, you may face adversities so preposterous, I can't even conceive of them.  But I know you'll pull through and make me proud.  I love you, son.
",308,112,6,24,Fry,Yancy FrySr23232,Yancy FrySr,"  Now, bundle up.  I don't want you gettin' frozen.
",52,112,6,24,Yancy FrySr,Fry23233,Fry," Bucket of hot dogs?
",21,113,6,25,Yancy FrySr,Cubert23234,Cubert," Check.
",8,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23235,Fry," Butt massager engaged?
",24,113,6,25,Cubert,Bender23236,Bender," Check.
",8,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23237,Fry," Then let the video games begin! Wait. Hang on. Iâ€” I lost my controller.
",73,113,6,25,Bender,Cubert23238,Cubert," There is no controller. The X-Cube tracks your motions with a built-in camera.
",80,113,6,25,Fry,Bender23239,Bender," Oh, yeah? Track this motion.
",30,113,6,25,Cubert,Cubert23240,Cubert," Frykowski. BenderIsGreat34. Follow me!
",40,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23241,Bender," Sounds like fun on the bun.
",29,113,6,25,Cubert,Cubert23242,Cubert," Aw! You guys again?!
",22,113,6,25,Bender,German #123243,German #1," Ach! These dorkeschoens. Let's humiliate them with slingshots.
",64,113,6,25,Cubert,Fry23244,Fry," Shoot your weapon, Private!
",29,113,6,25,German #1,Bender23245,Bender," Wait. How do Iâ€” Hold on. Oops.
",32,113,6,25,Fry,German #123246,German #1," Sorry to kill und run, but I really must be GÃ¶ring.
",53,113,6,25,Bender,Fry23247,Fry," Man!
",6,113,6,25,German #1,Bender23248,Bender," Pwned again.
",14,113,6,25,Fry,Cubert23249,Cubert," This is all Bender's fault. Admit it! Your reflexes suck!
",59,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23250,Bender," Aw... It's true! My circuitry's twelve years outta-date. I can't keep up with today's high-speed, top-o'-the-line kids.
",121,113,6,25,Cubert,Fry23251,Fry," You can't even keep up with me and I'm some sort o' stone-age throwback.
",74,113,6,25,Bender,Cubert23252,Cubert," You know... I might be able to speed up your reflexes by overclockin' ya.
",75,113,6,25,Fry,Bender23253,Bender," Eh... What's that, sonny? You say it'll put some whoopiee in my cushion?
",74,113,6,25,Cubert,Cubert23254,Cubert," This may take a while. I've got to adjust the memory timing, raise the CPU voltage, and delete twelve terabytes of outdated catchphrases.
",139,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23255,Bender," Sounds like fun on the bun!
",29,113,6,25,Cubert,Female Voice23256,Female Voice," Deleted.
",10,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23257,Bender,"  Oh.
",6,113,6,25,Female Voice,Leela23258,Leela," Fry, can we talk about our relationship?
",42,113,6,25,Bender,Fry23259,Fry," Of course. Our relationship is the best thing in my life, so I'm sure I'll enjoy talking about it with you.
",109,113,6,25,Leela,Leela23260,Leela," I dunno. I guess I'm just feeling uneasy about us being so on-again, off-again.
",81,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23261,Fry," Maybe it's none o' my business, but, if it were up to me, we'd be on all the time. An' I mean all the time.
",109,113,6,25,Leela,Leela23262,Leela," But what would that be like? I mean... If we were together, where would we be ten years from now? Still here?
",111,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23263,Fry," Definitely. Or... Somewhere else.
",35,113,6,25,Leela,Leela23264,Leela," Maybe I'm havin' some kinda... Early-life crisis, but... Look: Don't you ever wonder about the future?
",104,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23265,Fry," Well, sure, but... You're always in it. Also, sometimes, terminators.
",71,113,6,25,Leela,Cubert23266,Cubert," Alright. You should run a lot faster now. Unless you die.
",59,113,6,25,Fry,Bender23267,Bender,"  Woo! I'm smart! I know how to spell aardvark. February is the shortest month. There's three-thousand-eighteen jelly beans in that jar.
",137,113,6,25,Cubert,Cubert23268,Cubert," Damn, I'm good.
",17,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23269,Bender," I mean three-thousand-eighteen rat kidneys.
",45,113,6,25,Cubert,Cubert23270,Cubert," Now, then, my man. Let's see if your reflexes areâ€”
",52,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23271,Bender," Faster!
",9,113,6,25,Cubert,Cubert23272,Cubert,"  Get 'em! Get 'em! Get 'em!
",29,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23273,Bender," Eh, foreign aggressors. Vhat's up?
",36,113,6,25,Cubert,German #123274,German #1," Oh, we were just eating spaetzle and listening to Kraftwerkâ€” Iâ€” I mean, ""Fire!""
",81,113,6,25,Bender,German #223275,German #2," That tap-dancing, decadent jazz baby is too fast for us!
",58,113,6,25,German #1,German #123276,German #1," Let's see him outrun a V-2!
",29,113,6,25,German #2,Bender23277,Bender," It's my brains against your von Braun!
",40,113,6,25,German #1,German #123278,German #1," Ach! I could have fired a V-8!
",32,113,6,25,Bender,Walt23279,Walt," Those guys normally stink. That's why we play them exclusively.
",65,113,6,25,German #1,Larry23280,Larry," Those cheaters must've cheated!
",33,113,6,25,Walt,Walt23281,Walt," Now, Larry. Let's deal with this like mature adults.  Mommy!
",62,113,6,25,Larry,Mom23282,Mom," What is it, you colicky bastards?!
",36,113,6,25,Walt,Walt23283,Walt," We were playing video games and the other kids didn't play fair!
",66,113,6,25,Mom,Mom23284,Mom," What?! Nobody rips off my kids but me! We can find out who they are through their motion-capture camera. It better not be those little Korean girls again. Aha! Got it!
",169,113,6,25,Walt,Bender23285,Bender,"  Woo! We're the greatest! Mostly me!
",38,113,6,25,Mom,Mom23286,Mom,"  Bender RodrÃ_guez?
",20,113,6,25,Bender,Walt23287,Walt,"  But he's a stock MomCorp bending unit.  And 'e's twelve years out-of-date. How could 'e possibly play that well?
",115,113,6,25,Mom,Bender23288,Bender,"  Did you see me?! History came alive an' I killed it!
",55,113,6,25,Walt,Cubert23289,Cubert,"  If I overclock you some more, maybe we can beat those Korean girls!
",70,113,6,25,Bender,Mom23290,Mom," Well, well. That nerd burglar overclocked the Robot's processor!
",66,113,6,25,Cubert,Larry23291,Larry," And that voids his warranty. Even an idiot like me knows that.
",64,113,6,25,Mom,Mom23292,Mom," An idiot like you knows nothing! What matters is... It violates the licence agreement. And that means I've got 'im right by his littleâ€”

",20,113,6,25,Farnsworth,Mom23314,Mom,"  First, click the licence agreement, deary.

Bein' overclocked was a start, but, once I activate this processor, I'll be all like, ""You're a big dummy, Einstein! Get a haircut!"" Aw! Wow! I can't believe how stupid I used to be an' you still are. What are all these page-y things?
",317,113,6,25,Hermes,Amy23327,Amy," Look out! You're overheating!
",31,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23328,Bender," Yeah, yeah. There. Now, I'm water-cooled. I can stimulate my intellect without further thermodynamical disruptions.
",117,113,6,25,Amy,Fry23329,Fry," I miss the old, illiterate Bender.
",36,113,6,25,Bender,Hermes23330,Hermes," What's happened to you, mon? I thought you liked beer an' knock-knock jokes.
",78,113,6,25,Fry,Bender23331,Bender," I'm processin' so fast, it's like I can anticipate that the ceilin' fan's gonna fall an' knock Zoidberg unconscious.
",118,113,6,25,Hermes,Zoidberg23332,Zoidberg," Wrong, Mr. Genius.
",20,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23333,Bender," Not that ceilin' fan. In fact, lookin' ahead, it's obvious Mom won't allow me to stay accelerated like this. Hmmm. Who's up for a turkey dinner an' a game o' badminton?
",170,113,6,25,Zoidberg,Hermes23334,Hermes," Say what?!
",12,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23335,Bender," Yup.
",6,113,6,25,Hermes,Amy23336,Amy," Uh-oh. 'E must be overheating again.
",38,113,6,25,Bender,Hoverfish23337,Hoverfish," Bending unit, you are ordered to report for factory reset.
",60,113,6,25,Amy,Bender23338,Bender," Okay. Sure. But, first, this.
",31,113,6,25,Hoverfish,Zoidberg23339,Zoidberg," I hear turkey. Woop-woop-woop-woop-woopâ€” Oh, boy. Ay... Ay. Ay.
",65,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23340,Bender," Ten more processors for me. Once I install these, I'll have access to the loftiest realms o' thought!
",103,113,6,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg23341,Zoidberg," Anyone have access to a lofty realm of gravy?
",47,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23342,Bender," I can conceive of gravies that would boggle your tiny mind! But it's not safe here. So I'll need to find a hideout.
",117,113,6,25,Zoidberg,Fry23343,Fry," Hideout? Bender, are you becoming some kinda supervillain?
",60,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23344,Bender," Farewell, monobrains.
",23,113,6,25,Fry,Yellow and red lawyer23345,Yellow and red lawyer," Your Honour, Mom is a poor, frail industrialist with three special sons who require constant neglect. Yet, isn't it true, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that this boy, this... Cubert Farnsworth...
",201,113,6,25,Bender,Cubert23346,Cubert,"  That's my name. Don't wear it out.
",37,113,6,25,Yellow and red lawyer,Yellow and red lawyer23347,Yellow and red lawyer," Deliberately robber her blind by improving his own Robot?!
",60,113,6,25,Cubert,Fishy Joe23348,Fishy Joe," It's true! 'E did it!
",23,113,6,25,Yellow and red lawyer,Yellow and red lawyer23349,Yellow and red lawyer," No further questions for this jury.
",37,113,6,25,Fishy Joe,Ron Whitey23350,Ron Whitey," Before I call a recess for mimosas and horse breeding, can the defence produce the bending unit in question?
",110,113,6,25,Yellow and red lawyer,Farnsworth23351,Farnsworth,"  We don't know where the hell 'e is.
",38,113,6,25,Ron Whitey,Hyper-Chicken23352,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour, that is something we cannot a-doodle-do.
",55,113,6,25,Farnsworth,Ron Whitey23353,Ron Whitey," Then I'm holding the defendants in contempt and fining them ten-thousand dollars a day until they produce the Robot.
",118,113,6,25,Hyper-Chicken,Hermes23354,Hermes," Oh! At that rate, Planet Express will be bankrupt in... Four fingers!
",71,113,6,25,Ron Whitey,Hermes23355,Hermes," It's been a good run, people, but this is the end.
",52,113,6,25,Hermes,Zoidberg23356,Zoidberg,"  Wait!  I've got it! This building's technically in the theatre district. If we could mount one big musical featuring everyone's talents, we might just save Planet Express!
",174,113,6,25,Hermes,Nibbler23357,Nibbler," We'll call it Nibbler on the Roof!
",36,113,6,25,Zoidberg,Fry23358,Fry," Alright!
",10,113,6,25,Nibbler,Zoidberg23359,Zoidberg," Hooray!
",9,113,6,25,Fry,Hermes23360,Hermes," We're saved!
",14,113,6,25,Zoidberg,Leela23361,Leela," I've been thinking a lot about moving on with my life. And hearing the words Nibbler on the Roof has given me the kick in the pants I needed. It's time for me to leave and make a fresh start.
",193,113,6,25,Hermes,Fry23362,Fry,"  Don't go, Leela, please. You an' me... We were supposed to...
",64,113,6,25,Leela,Leela23363,Leela," What?
",7,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23364,Fry," I dunno.  But someday we'll find out.  Won't we?
",50,113,6,25,Leela,Leela23365,Leela," Goodbye, Fry.
",15,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23366,Fry," I dunno, Randy. I just feel like my life's falling apart. The Professor's in jail and now Leela's gone forever.
",113,113,6,25,Leela,Randy Munchnik23367,Randy Munchnik," Stay strong, Fry.
",19,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23368,Fry," You're the best friend I have left.  An' I barely even know you.
",66,113,6,25,Randy Munchnik,Randy Munchnik23369,Randy Munchnik," Have you thought about asking Bender for help?
",48,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23370,Fry,"  What are you, Randy? A complete moron?!  I'd love to talk to Bender, but I 'ave no idea where 'e is.
",103,113,6,25,Randy Munchnik,Randy Munchnik23371,Randy Munchnik," Well, if 'e's runnin' on twelve processors, 'e must be some place with a lotta power and liquid coolant.
",106,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23372,Fry,"  Aw! You're no help at all!  I'm gonna go kill myself.
",56,113,6,25,Randy Munchnik,Fry23373,Fry,"  Wait a second. Power. Liquid coolant.  That gives me the option of electrocution or drowning.
",96,113,6,25,Fry,Paper-hatted salesman23374,Paper-hatted salesman,"  Barrels here.  Can't go over the Falls without a barrel.
",59,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23375,Fry," What are my chances of surviving in one o' those?
",51,113,6,25,Paper-hatted salesman,Paper-hatted salesman23376,Paper-hatted salesman," Slim to none.
",15,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23377,Fry," I like those odds!
",20,113,6,25,Paper-hatted salesman,Fry23378,Fry,"  Wait. This isn't a barrel. It's just a stinking cask! I want my money  back!  Ow! Ow!
",88,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23379,Fry," That was not worth three-thousand dollars.
",44,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23380,Fry," Hello? Anybody?
",17,113,6,25,Fry,Bender23381,Bender,"  Fry?
",7,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23382,Fry," Bender?! Are you in here?!
",28,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23383,Bender," In here is the only place I'm not. I amuse myself.
",52,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23384,Fry," Butâ€” Bender?! What happened to you?
",37,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23385,Bender," I'll try to put it in terms you can comprehend. I passed the existential singularity.
",87,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23386,Fry," Try harder!
",13,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23387,Bender," I hacked myself inside-out and now the entire universe is my processor.
",73,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23388,Fry," Whoa! I definitely wanna hear about that. But, first, I need your help. The Professor and Cubert are in trouble and Leela left me. I'm in misery!
",147,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23389,Bender," I've grown far beyond the petty concerns of your world. Every time I burp, a new galaxy is born.  Two if I've been eatin' broccoli. All existence is just a chess game. An' I can see fifty moves ahead. Human emotion no longer concerns me.
",239,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23390,Fry," Butâ€” But Randy saidâ€”
",22,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23391,Bender,"  Randy?!  'Ave you been hangin' out with Randy?!
",50,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23392,Fry," Please, Bender. If everything is a chess game for you, you must know how to help me.
",86,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23393,Bender," I'm sorry, Fry. But some games you just can't win.  Cubert and the Professor are guilty. The jury will vote to convict.  I can't change that.
",143,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23394,Fry," Well, what about Leela? Is there any hope things could still work out between us?
",83,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23395,Bender,"  It's getting late. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some new heavy elements to create.  Better cover your nads. It may get a little non-Newtonian in here.
",157,113,6,25,Fry,Ron Whitey23396,Ron Whitey," Not only have the defendants failed to rebut the charges, they've not even presented any mitigating factors to recommend leniency. It strikes me as an extra-risky strategy.
",174,113,6,25,Bender,Hyper-Chicken23397,Hyper-Chicken," Did you say ""extra-crispy recipe""?
",36,113,6,25,Ron Whitey,Ron Whitey23398,Ron Whitey," You know I didn't.
",20,113,6,25,Hyper-Chicken,Hyper-Chicken23399,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honour... If we could locate Bender RodrÃ_guez, he would testify that my clients acted without malice.
",108,113,6,25,Ron Whitey,Fry23400,Fry," No, 'e wouldn't. Bender doesn't care about us anymore.
",56,113,6,25,Hyper-Chicken,Zoidberg23401,Zoidberg," Someone used to care about me?! Hooray!
",41,113,6,25,Fry,Ron Whitey23402,Ron Whitey," In that case, the jury will begin its deliberations. Bailiff,  release the jury collies.
",90,113,6,25,Zoidberg,Mom23403,Mom," I finally nailed Farnsworth. Destroyin' the boy is just icing on the cake.
",76,113,6,25,Ron Whitey,Larry23404,Larry," No one destroys a boy like you, Mother.
",41,113,6,25,Mom,Mom23405,Mom," Thank you, you repulsive disappointment.
",42,113,6,25,Larry,Fry23406,Fry," Any word from Leela?
",22,113,6,25,Mom,Amy23407,Amy," I heard she took a job selling deep-space real estate. Somewhere beyond the most distant thing ever observed with a telescope.
",128,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23408,Fry,"  She always liked not being observed with a telescope.
",56,113,6,25,Amy,Ron Whitey23409,Ron Whitey," Order. Order in the head.
",27,113,6,25,Fry,Bender23410,Bender," For reasons beyond even my comprehension, I 'ave returned to testify on behalf of the defendants.
",99,113,6,25,Ron Whitey,Farnsworth23411,Farnsworth," Yay!
",6,113,6,25,Bender,Cubert23412,Cubert," Yay, Bender!
",14,113,6,25,Farnsworth,Fry23413,Fry,"  I knew 'e cared about us!
",28,113,6,25,Cubert,Hermes23414,Hermes," You said you knew he didn't care about us!
",44,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23415,Fry," Leave me alone.
",17,113,6,25,Hermes,Yellow and red lawyer23416,Yellow and red lawyer," Your Honour, I object to this surprise witness. 'E's too surprising!
",70,113,6,25,Fry,Ron Whitey23417,Ron Whitey," Sustained. Testimony has closed.
",34,113,6,25,Yellow and red lawyer,Bender23418,Bender," Butâ€” Your Honourâ€”
",19,113,6,25,Ron Whitey,Ron Whitey23419,Ron Whitey," Silence! One more in-burst like that an' I'll have this courtroom removed from you! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
",103,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23420,Bender,"  I'm sorry, guys. I didn't realise I was late. I guess I'm not as smart as everybody thought.
",95,113,6,25,Ron Whitey,Farnsworth23421,Farnsworth," I was born in prison and I'll die in prison.
",46,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23422,Bender," There is still one hope. You're co-defendants. An' the jury might not wanna convict a twelve-year-old.
",104,113,6,25,Farnsworth,Mom23423,Mom," Son of a nerd. He may be right! Make sure Farnsworth doesn't get off easy on account o' that snot-gobbling twerp.
",115,113,6,25,Bender,Ron Whitey23424,Ron Whitey," 'As the jury reached a verdict?
",33,113,6,25,Mom,Fishy Joe23425,Fishy Joe," Not just any verdict, Your Honour. A great verdict!
",53,113,6,25,Ron Whitey,Mom23426,Mom,"  They're going to take pity on him!  Do something!
",52,113,6,25,Fishy Joe,Yellow and red lawyer23427,Yellow and red lawyer," Your Honour, prosecution moves to drop the charges against Cubert Farnsworth.
",79,113,6,25,Mom,Ron Whitey23428,Ron Whitey," Very well. The case against Cubert Farnsworth is hereby dismissed.
",68,113,6,25,Yellow and red lawyer,Cubert23429,Cubert," Told ya I'd get away with it.
",31,113,6,25,Ron Whitey,Ron Whitey23430,Ron Whitey," That'll do, pig. Please read the verdict against Professor Farnsworth.
",72,113,6,25,Cubert,Fishy Joe23431,Fishy Joe," You got it, Judge. I think you'll find this verdict as fair as it is cruel.
",77,113,6,25,Ron Whitey,Bender23432,Bender,"  Your Honour,  I move for a mistrial on grounds of double jeopardy. Cubert Farnsworth cannot be tried twice for the same crime! Cubert is the Professor's clone. Ergo, they are legally the same person. Since you dismissed the charges against Cubert, you cannot convict the Professor of these same charges!
",306,113,6,25,Fishy Joe,Hyper-Chicken23433,Hyper-Chicken," Well, I'll be a nugget's uncle. He's right!
",45,113,6,25,Bender,Ron Whitey23434,Ron Whitey," What a brilliant legal shenanigan! Case dismissed.
",52,113,6,25,Hyper-Chicken,Zoidberg23435,Zoidberg," Yay!
",6,113,6,25,Ron Whitey,Fry23436,Fry," Yay!
",6,113,6,25,Zoidberg,Hermes23437,Hermes," Yes!
",6,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23438,Fry," Bender, you knew all this would happen, didn't you?
",53,113,6,25,Hermes,Bender23439,Bender," Yes. All except this part.
",28,113,6,25,Fry,Mom23440,Mom," If I can't bring down Farnsworth, I can at least dumb down 'is Robot. Take 'im away and reset 'im to factory-stupid condition!
",128,113,6,25,Bender,Fry23441,Fry," Bender, wait. While you can still calculate the future, just tell me: What's gonna happen with me an' Leela?
",110,113,6,25,Mom,Bender23442,Bender," There's no time now. Quick, Zoidberg! Take three steps to your right!
",71,113,6,25,Fry,Nibbler23443,Nibbler,"  We've had some tough times,  but at least we won a Tony!
",59,113,6,25,Bender,Zoidberg23444,Zoidberg," You won a Tony. Feh!
",22,113,6,25,Nibbler,Fry23445,Fry," Wow. You gave up your superintelligence to save us. Why did you come back?
",76,113,6,25,Zoidberg,Bender23446,Bender," Honestly, I couldn't think o' one good reason. But some decisions can't be made by thinking. Even if you're drunk! No galaxies there.
",135,113,6,25,Fry,Leela23447,Leela," Knock knock.
",14,113,6,25,Bender,Bender23448,Bender," Oh! Oh! Who's there?!
",23,113,6,25,Leela,Fry23449,Fry," Leela?!
",9,113,6,25,Bender,Farnsworth23450,Farnsworth," Yay!
",6,113,6,25,Fry,Bender23451,Bender," Leela who?!
",13,113,6,25,Farnsworth,Fry23452,Fry,"  It's good  to see you.  Is it good to see me?
",48,113,6,25,Bender,Leela23453,Leela," Of course.
",12,113,6,25,Fry,Amy23454,Amy,"  Come on in, Leela!  Take that ugly coat off!
",47,113,6,25,Leela,Leela23455,Leela," Thanks. Hi, everybody.
",24,113,6,25,Amy,Hermes23456,Hermes," So... Tell us. How's the intergalactic real estate going?
",59,113,6,25,Leela,Leela23457,Leela," Pretty good. I just sold a castle to the King of Space. But, somehow, I keep finding myself thinking about this place. An' things.
",132,113,6,25,Hermes,Fry23458,Fry,"  Things  like me or... Things like this badminton racket?
",59,113,6,25,Leela,Leela23459,Leela," You, Fry. Bender, while you still have your giant brain, please... Tell me: If Fry an' I ended up togetherâ€”
",109,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23460,Fry," It's too late, Leela. He's good, old Bender again. 'E's totally useless.
",74,113,6,25,Leela,Bender23461,Bender," Well, not totally! Before they reset me, I figured out the answers to life's great questions. Uh... This is the reason we exist. This is which ceilin' fans are gonna fall. Aha! Found it! Fry and Leela's Ultimate Fate... By Bender.
",232,113,6,25,Fry,Fry23462,Fry," Uh, it's probably better if we don't know. Uh, mystery of life and whatnot.
",77,113,6,25,Bender,Leela23463,Leela," Gimme that!
",13,113,6,25,Fry,Galactic Entity23464,Galactic Entity," A wise man once said that nothing really dies. It just comes back in a new form. Then he died. So, next time you see a lowly salamander, think twice before you step on it. It might be you. Stand by for ""Reincarnation"".

",27,114,6,26,Galactic Entity,Leela23466,Leela,"  Jumpin' Joe an' golly jeeper,
I got one gigantic peeper.
Sassafras an' banana oil,
I'm a bee-youtiful purple-haired goyl.
",124,114,6,26,Planet Express headquarters,Bender23467,Bender," Watch it!
",11,114,6,26,Leela,Fry23468,Fry," Oh, it's just that I love Leela something awful. Do you think a space-age dame like her would ever marry a two-bit, low-life delivery boy like me an' also I 'ave bad posture and severe financial problems?
",206,114,6,26,Bender,Bender23469,Bender," Have you tried gettin' 'er pregnant?
",38,114,6,26,Fry,Fry23470,Fry," Gosh, yes. I've tried an' tried, but, so far, I only got Amy pregnant.
",72,114,6,26,Bender,Bender23471,Bender," You know what your problem is?  Too much smoke in your face.
",62,114,6,26,Fry,Fry23472,Fry," I wanna ask Leela to marry me, but I can't afford a diamond ring big enough to express my love.
",97,114,6,26,Bender,Bender23473,Bender," That's for sure.  Not on the measly salary I steal from you each month.
",73,114,6,26,Fry,Horn loudspeaker23474,Horn loudspeaker," All crew, report to the laboratorium. Get a wiggle on.
",56,114,6,26,Bender,Fry23475,Fry," Thanks for the heads-up, Sparky.
",34,114,6,26,Horn loudspeaker,Horn loudspeaker23476,Horn loudspeaker," Mhm. Fish on Friday. An' Human flesh the rest of the week.
",60,114,6,26,Fry,Farnsworth23477,Farnsworth," Movietone News, everyone.  I've discovered a new comet!

",43,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23479,Farnsworth," Hang on. Let me just adjust it to your eye level.
",51,114,6,26,Leela,Leela23480,Leela,"  Holy matrimony!  That's one flashy rock!
",43,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23481,Farnsworth," Indeed. It's pure diamondium!
",31,114,6,26,Leela,Fry23482,Fry," Um... Would it be possible to break off a piece an' put it in an engagement ring for reasons that are private?
",112,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23483,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff! Nothing in the universe can fracture diamondium. Not even God 1 an' God 2 put together. But behold!  The tail is composed of abrasive comet powder.  And that's just what I need to put a washday shine on my new Doomsday device.  Now hop in the flivver and score me some o' that sweet, sweet powder.
",309,114,6,26,Fry,Hermes23484,Hermes," Comet ahoy!  Why, it's lit up like a smooth, refreshing Chesterfield.
",71,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23485,Farnsworth," Get plenty of that powder. I want this bomb to sparkle like the floor at Grand Central Station.  Over and out.
",112,114,6,26,Hermes,Amy23486,Amy," Watch it, ya stumblebums! You're boopin' my betty!
",52,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Fry23487,Fry," Um... I'll be back in a jiff. I gotta go check this comet for anarchists.
",75,114,6,26,Amy,Fry23488,Fry," Wouldja look at that gem! Slap that shiner on a ring an' me an' Leela will be doing the married, horizontal Charleston in no time.
",132,114,6,26,Fry,Fry23489,Fry," Alright, diamond. You won those rounds. But I've got an ace up my hole.
",73,114,6,26,Fry,Leela23490,Leela," I love this time of day. There's such a beautiful stillness.
",62,114,6,26,Fry,Fry23491,Fry," Leela, I don't know if words can describe how I feel about youâ€”

",7,114,6,26,Fry,Fry23493,Fry," Huh. I guess they can. Anyhow, when a guy feels good about 'is sweetheart, 'e wants to prove it by giving 'er somethin' really... Good!

",35,114,6,26,Fry,Fry23495,Fry," What I'm tryin' to say is... In all the world, I couldn't find a diamond good enough for you. But then I found one out there...  Among the stars. The beautiful, affordable stars.
",180,114,6,26,Leela,Leela23496,Leela," You mean... When you disappeared up on the comet...
",53,114,6,26,Fry,Fry23497,Fry," Exactly.
",10,114,6,26,Leela,Leela23498,Leela," I thought you snuck off to take a dump.
",41,114,6,26,Fry,Fry23499,Fry," A man can sneak off to do two things.

",10,114,6,26,Fry,Fry23501,Fry," In exactly ten seconds, the Doomsday device will blow the stone loose. An', if my calculations are correct, it will land here on your finger.

",23,114,6,26,Fry,Fry23505,Fry," The diamond still didn't break!   Now, you'll never know 'ow much I love you.   It went kersplitters!
",103,114,6,26,Bird,Leela23506,Leela," Fry, I don't need a diamond. You've given me the most beautiful rainbow I've ever seen! All the colours of the spectrum!

",62,114,6,26,Leela,Leela23508,Leela,"  What's that?!  Is my eye playing trick on me?!  It's so beautiful! Fry, you've created a new colour! Totally different from any other colour or combination of colours.
",170,114,6,26,Fry,Fry23509,Fry," Shucks. It's still only half as beautiful as you.  Whoa!
",58,114,6,26,Leela,Leela23510,Leela," Whoa! I wish this moment could last forever.

",110,114,6,26,Bender,Bender23516,Bender," So we can leave early?
",24,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23517,Farnsworth," Certainly not!  Not until I demonstrate this new microscope lens,  made from the debris of that diamondium comet.
",115,114,6,26,Bender,Bender23518,Bender," Eh, Professor.
",16,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23519,Farnsworth,"  Yes, Bender?
",15,114,6,26,Bender,Bender23520,Bender," Boo!   Okay. Too bad. Goodbye.
",32,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23521,Farnsworth," You're not through with this level! I have another lens.

",52,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Hermes23523,Hermes," Whatever you say, mon.
",24,114,6,26,Bender,Farnsworth23524,Farnsworth," Due to the lens' remarkable quark-lattice structure,  it should be capable of unthinkable magnification!  Come.  Follow me to the lab.
",136,114,6,26,Hermes,Bender23525,Bender," Hey, I'm gonna try that! So long, meatbags! Son of aâ€”
",55,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23526,Farnsworth," Eh, let me just insert  lens in microscope.  There! Now, for the first time, we may be able to see the infinitesimal fabric of matter itself.  Laying bare the most fundamental laws of the universe!
",199,114,6,26,Bender,Leela23527,Leela,"  Hey, Fry. I know something you could lay bare.
",49,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Fry23528,Fry,"  Leela! Shhh! I'm tryin' to listen to a physics lecture!
",58,114,6,26,Leela,Farnsworth23529,Farnsworth,"  Now, to examine some matter. Any old matter will do.
",55,114,6,26,Fry,Hermes23530,Hermes,"  Mon, that's some cheap-ass matter!  What the hell is it?
",59,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23531,Farnsworth,"  Oh,  it's just a log I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea. Now, to penetrate its deepest mysteries.
",108,114,6,26,Hermes,Leela23532,Leela,"  Hey, Fry.
",12,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Fry23533,Fry,"  Leela! No means no!
",22,114,6,26,Leela,Farnsworth23534,Farnsworth," Oh, my! There's a frog on a bump on this log that I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea!
",95,114,6,26,Fry,Leela23535,Leela," An' that's the ultimate secret of the universe?!
",50,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23536,Farnsworth," Apparently so. Wait! There's a snail on the tail of the frog on the bump on this log that I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea!
",135,114,6,26,Leela,Hermes23537,Hermes," Dear Eliza!
",13,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23538,Farnsworth,"  The snail itself is composed of cells, molecules, atoms...
",61,114,6,26,Hermes,Fry23539,Fry," Pfff! Those things don't rhyme!
",33,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23540,Farnsworth,"  Things only rhyme below ten to the minus five angstroms, you dope!  Now, ions an' pions, muons an' gluons, neutrinos, gravitinos...  We're closing in on the very smallest particles of matter! For the first time, we're about to observe the fundamental structure of the universe.  Such detail.  Such finely wrought intricate beauty!
",333,114,6,26,Fry,Leela23541,Leela," It's like staring into the face of God!
",41,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Scruffy23542,Scruffy," It's a mirror into Scruffy's soul.
",36,114,6,26,Leela,Farnsworth23543,Farnsworth," This explains everything! Even the Big Bang that created the universe! All that's left is the mathematics! Put down h-bar, uh, carry the infinity, andâ€” My-reka! There it is! The Grand Unified Theory! Reducing all the laws of nature to a single equation!
",255,114,6,26,Scruffy,Amy23544,Amy," Professor, you did it! You solved the problem that baffled Einstein an' drove Stephen Hawking to quit physics and become a cartoon voice actor!
",145,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Stephen Hawkings head23545,Stephen Hawkings head," I like physics, but I love cartoons.
",38,114,6,26,Amy,Farnsworth23546,Farnsworth," This is the greatest moment in scientific history! At last, there are no more questions left to answer!
",105,114,6,26,Stephen Hawkings head,Stephen Hawkings head23547,Stephen Hawkings head," Yay!
",6,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Amy23548,Amy," Yay!
",6,114,6,26,Stephen Hawkings head,Hermes23549,Hermes," Woohoo! Alright! Well done, Professor. Okay. Back to work, everyone.
",70,114,6,26,Amy,Farnsworth23550,Farnsworth," Wait. There are no more questions left to answer.
",51,114,6,26,Hermes,Farnsworth23551,Farnsworth," Oh.
",5,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Morbo23552,Morbo," And those are today's high scores. Linda?
",43,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Linda23553,Linda," Thanks, Morbo. Coming up next, Galaxians. What you need to know to protect your family.
",89,114,6,26,Morbo,Farnsworth23554,Farnsworth," How do you people do it? How do you go on knowing there's nothing more to know?!
",82,114,6,26,Linda,Fry23555,Fry," I watch TV. It's the next best thing to bein' alive.
",54,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23556,Farnsworth," What's the use? I'm just not capable of the happiness of the dumb. If only I'd made some mistake!
",99,114,6,26,Fry,Stephen Hawkings head23557,Stephen Hawkings head," You didn't. I checked the invariance of your Lagrangian. Hubba-hubba.
",71,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23558,Farnsworth," Then there's nothing left to do! Nothing!
",43,114,6,26,Stephen Hawkings head,Bender23559,Bender," Would it cheer you up if I punched Fry in the groin? 'Cause I'll do it. Regardless. Body blow! Body blow!
",107,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23560,Farnsworth," I devoted every waking minute to answering the fundamental questions of science.
",82,114,6,26,Bender,Farnsworth23561,Farnsworth,"  I never married.
",19,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23562,Farnsworth,"  Rarely went outside!
",23,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23563,Farnsworth,"  And, now that I've found all the answers, I realise that what I was living for were the questions!
",101,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Fry23564,Fry," That stinks, Professor. Too bad the universe made it turn out that way and not some other way. I wonder why it did that.
",122,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Stephen Hawkings head23565,Stephen Hawkings head," Probably magnets.
",19,114,6,26,Fry,Farnsworth23566,Farnsworth," Shut up, Hawking. Fry, you idiot!  You're a genius! Why are the laws of physics what they are? Instead of some other laws? To find out, we'd have to recreate the conditions before the Big Bang. It would take decades of work by thousands of scientists in a particle accelerator powered by dump trucks of flaming grant money.  Of course, there'd be no guarantee of success.  And, in any case, I'd never live to see it.
",418,114,6,26,Stephen Hawkings head,Leela23567,Leela," I'm surprised you lived through that sentence.
",48,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Hermes23568,Hermes," Sorry you wasted your life, Professor. I guess you never know everything after all.
",85,114,6,26,Leela,Farnsworth23569,Farnsworth," Indeed. The pursuit of knowledge is hopeless and eternal.  Hooray!
",68,114,6,26,Hermes,Amy23570,Amy,"  Yay!
",7,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Hermes23571,Hermes,"  Yeah-heah!

",52,114,6,26,Subtitle,Farnsworth23579,Farnsworth," Ha ha ha! I'll never tell you.  It's a deep space-emotion detector.  The detector can tell you're impressed. You should be!  Wha? The marvellous device. It's detecting a massive burst of anger. From deep space!
",212,114,6,26,Leela,Subtitle23580,Subtitle," There is Earth! Attack it as previously discussed!
",52,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Fry23581,Fry," Flying bananas? Ha ha! I will slice them on my morning fish porridge.
",71,114,6,26,Subtitle,Farnsworth23582,Farnsworth," This is no time for one of your jokes, Fry.
",45,114,6,26,Fry,Fry23583,Fry," I will tell you something that's no joke.  I will lead the defence fight.
",75,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23584,Farnsworth," Ha ha ha ha! Don't make me laugh. If we fight, we'll surely be destroyed.
",75,114,6,26,Fry,Hermes23585,Hermes," Then what is our only hope?!
",30,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Amy23586,Amy," We must summon Zagtar, defender of space!
",43,114,6,26,Hermes,Hermes23587,Hermes," You forget!
",13,114,6,26,Amy,Hermes23588,Hermes,"  Zagtar was destroyed by the crystal space devil!
",51,114,6,26,Hermes,Leela23589,Leela,"  The crystal space devil was once my brother, Prince Hiroshi.
",63,114,6,26,Hermes,Leela23590,Leela,"  I mourn his loss. But what matters now is protecting Earth from that fruit armada.
",85,114,6,26,Leela,Farnsworth23591,Farnsworth," I see your mother, the water Mutant, didn't raise any fools, Turanga Leela. Our only hope is to communicate with the Aliens. And show them our peaceful intentions.
",165,114,6,26,Leela,Bender23592,Bender," Perhaps they speak perfect English... As do we.
",49,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23593,Farnsworth," We can't take that chance! We'll need my universal auto-translator!

",41,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Fry23595,Fry," That will show them our peaceful intentions.
",46,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23596,Farnsworth," The only question is, ""Who should  be our spokesman?!""
",56,114,6,26,Fry,Zoidberg23597,Zoidberg," Me! Me! Choose Zoidberg.
",26,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Fry23598,Fry," Zoidberg, a diplomat? The list of things I've heard now contains everything.
",78,114,6,26,Zoidberg,Zoidberg23599,Zoidberg," Hear my words. My shell may be tough like a samurai honeymoon mask, but inside I'm as soft and sensitive as a girl made of custard!

",68,114,6,26,Cubert,Leela23602,Leela," Instead, I will send the peace transmission. Most honoured visitors, we greet you in peace.
",93,114,6,26,Zoidberg,Subtitle23603,Subtitle," Why does it flap its face hole? I am puzzled, for we don't know what mouths are. It's a threat! Destruct them!

",36,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23610,Farnsworth," Defeat is ours. If we can't communicate with these bone-jelly ghosts, we're doomed!
",85,114,6,26,Bender,Amy23611,Amy," Professor, I 'ave analysed the Aliens' movements with this movement analyser.
",79,114,6,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23612,Farnsworth," That device was a gift from my ancestors. Go on.
",50,114,6,26,Amy,Amy23613,Amy," It seems their movements are a form of language. Rather than speaking Jaâ€”

",10,114,6,26,Amy,Amy23615,Amy,"  Like us, they speak by dancing.
",34,114,6,26,Transition Announcer #1,Farnsworth23616,Farnsworth," Of course! Having no mouths our ears, they could only communicate through motions!
",84,114,6,26,Amy,Fry23617,Fry," Or perhaps by odours!

",6,114,6,26,Hermes,Bender23627,Bender," Of course, I will do the peace dance. But I will need 'elp.

",38,115,7,1,Farnsworth,Ben23849,Ben," More than anything.
",21,115,7,1,Bender,Bender23850,Bender," Just remember, your daddy loves you. Remember that, will you, son? Remember that! 
",84,115,7,1,Ben,Ben23851,Ben," Dad, are you crying?
",22,115,7,1,Bender,Bender23852,Bender," ""No,"" I said with the mouth you're lookin' at.
",48,115,7,1,Ben,Bender23853,Bender,"  You sure take after your old man.
",36,115,7,1,Bender,Ben23854,Ben," I never knew my father.
",25,115,7,1,Bender,Bender23855,Bender,"  Ooooh, it's not important. What is important is that we get you to Bending State Santa Cruz in time for registration!
",120,115,7,1,Ben,Zoidberg23856,Zoidberg," Then we better hurry!  Registration ends in one hour!
",55,115,7,1,Bender,Bender23857,Bender," To the ship!
",14,115,7,1,Zoidberg,Leela23858,Leela," It's too foggy! We can't navigate through this storm! Our lights aren't bright enough.
",88,115,7,1,Bender,Bender23859,Bender," I'm sorry I let you down, son.
",32,115,7,1,Leela,Ben23860,Ben," Who are you again?
",20,115,7,1,Bender,Bender23861,Bender," It's just not possible to get you to bending school this year.
",64,115,7,1,Ben,Fry23862,Fry," Or is there?!
",15,115,7,1,Bender,Fry23863,Fry," Merry College Registration Day, everyone!
",43,115,7,1,Fry,Leela23864,Leela," A lot of weather we're having.
",32,116,7,2,Fry,Fry23865,Fry," Allow me, m'lady.  Shall we go a-trousering?
",46,116,7,2,Leela,Leela23866,Leela," Fry, I appreciate the gallantry, but isn't this a bit much?
",61,116,7,2,Fry,Fry23867,Fry,"  You're right. I'm sorry for showing my love.
",47,116,7,2,Leela,Leela23868,Leela,"  Okay. Fine.
",14,116,7,2,Fry,Fry23869,Fry," Here, take my hand!
",21,116,7,2,Leela,Farnsworth23870,Farnsworth," News and weather, everyone. I'm sure you've all noticed the bizarre atmospheric conditions of late.
",101,116,7,2,Fry,Hermes23871,Hermes," Come to mention it, yes.
",26,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23872,Farnsworth," It seems something ain't right in the magnetosphere, so I'm launching this high-altitude weather balloon to gather more data.
",127,116,7,2,Hermes,Fry23873,Fry," My pants! My lucky pants!
",27,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Hermes23874,Hermes," They don't look so lucky to me.
",33,116,7,2,Fry,Fry23875,Fry," They are too! I was wearing them that time I found a dime in my ear! It was wearing them when I won a subscription to Redbook! And I was wearing them when I first met Leela, so, yeah, they're lucky!
",200,116,7,2,Hermes,Leela23876,Leela," Aw...also, oh, Lord.
",22,116,7,2,Fry,Fry23877,Fry," Plus, they're my only pants.
",30,116,7,2,Leela,Bender23878,Bender," You've worn the same pants for a thousand years? No wonder they made a run for it!  Woo!
",90,116,7,2,Fry,Farnsworth23879,Farnsworth," Soon your trousers will slip the surly bonds of Earth, and ascend to the heavens!
",83,116,7,2,Bender,Fry23880,Fry," I'm gonna blast that balloon!  No way will I let God get my pants!  Nobody messes with my pants. Not even the Holy One. Blessed be He. 
",137,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Hermes23881,Hermes," Look out! A Central Park badger!
",34,116,7,2,Fry,Fry23882,Fry," I'll save you, pants! Scruffy, do you have any varmint grease?
",64,116,7,2,Hermes,Scruffy23883,Scruffy," What viscosity you need?
",26,116,7,2,Fry,Fry23884,Fry," Woah, there's writing in here!  Also, this grease is flammable!
",65,116,7,2,Scruffy,Farnsworth23885,Farnsworth," Incredible! Who could have done this? The sewer mutants?
",58,116,7,2,Fry,Leela23886,Leela," No, this isn't mutant language. We use a lot more profanity.  Son of a biâ€“!
",77,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Fry23887,Fry," Leela! Take my hand!
",22,116,7,2,Leela,Leela23888,Leela," I'm slipping! The one time your hands aren't sticky, they're greasy!
",70,116,7,2,Fry,Fry23889,Fry," I'm sorry. Normally, I would have wiped them on my pants, butâ€“
",64,116,7,2,Leela,Fry23890,Fry," Are you okay?
",15,116,7,2,Fry,Leela23891,Leela," Iâ€“ow! My leg! It's broken! How'd you get down here?
",53,116,7,2,Fry,Fry23892,Fry," We made a rope from my shirt and jacket.  And an expedition flag from my underpants!  I'll help you up. Here, take my hand.
",125,116,7,2,Leela,Leela23893,Leela," Stop telling me to take your hand! Look, Fry, your noble things keep making things worse. Can't you just be a rude, unhelpful jerk like Bender?
",145,116,7,2,Fry,Bender23894,Bender," When I use up the toilet paper I don't put up a new roll!
",59,116,7,2,Leela,Zoidberg23895,Zoidberg," Fry, my friend, I found your pants!  And no sign of that crafty badger!
",73,116,7,2,Bender,Fry23896,Fry," All right! Lucky pants! 
",26,116,7,2,Zoidberg,Amy23897,Amy," Oh my God! Look what my flashlight found!
",43,116,7,2,Fry,Zoidberg23898,Zoidberg," A giant pyramid under New New York? What badger could have built this?
",72,116,7,2,Amy,Farnsworth23899,Farnsworth," And look at this intricately carved disk! It merits years of study. But how can we move such a fragile, preciousâ€“
",115,116,7,2,Zoidberg,Bender23900,Bender," Ancient history coming through! 
",34,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Farnsworth23901,Farnsworth," Amazing! It appears to be some kind of extremely ancient calendar! Predating even the girls of Sumeria! Of course! It's a Mayan calendar!  No...wait! There's some dried-up old stew on the screen.
Scruffy: Sorry. I was eating a can of breakfast and looking at porn.
",266,116,7,2,Bender,Amy23902,Amy,"  It's not Mayan, it's Martian!
",32,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Leela23903,Leela," Amy, you grew up on Mars, right? Can you read Martian?
",56,116,7,2,Amy,Amy23904,Amy," A little. I only learned enough to yell at my nanny. Let's see...  I think it means...""The sun will erupt...all shall perish. Blah, blah, blah.""
",146,116,7,2,Leela,Bender23905,Bender," Get to the point! What does it say about me, Bender?
",54,116,7,2,Amy,Amy23906,Amy,"  Nothing! But it does say a great cataclysm will destroy the world in the year thirty twelve! 
",96,116,7,2,Bender,Bender23907,Bender," The world? That's where I live! Told you it'd say something about me!
",71,116,7,2,Amy,Fry23908,Fry," So the world will end in three thousand twelve. Why does that year sound so familiar?
",87,116,7,2,Bender,Farnsworth23909,Farnsworth," Because that's the year that's this year! See?
",48,116,7,2,Fry,Scruffy23910,Scruffy,"  So, uh...are you all done with the computer?
",47,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Hermes23911,Hermes," Is it just me - or is the world endin' more often these days?
",63,116,7,2,Scruffy,Amy23912,Amy," The calendar predicts fires, earthquakes, sharksplosions...  Then, it just ends!
",82,116,7,2,Hermes,Farnsworth23913,Farnsworth," Exactly as the weather balloon foretold! Before Fry blew his pants outta the sky, it detected the onset of a catastrophic sunspot cycle.  It's starting!  This is the end of the world!
",185,116,7,2,Amy,Super Hero23914,Super Hero," Cowardman, away!
",18,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Nine23915,Nine," Some of us were crazy before it was cool.
",43,116,7,2,Super Hero,Leela23916,Leela," Evacuating the planet in 3...2...
",35,116,7,2,Nine,Farnsworth23917,Farnsworth," So long, Earth! Thanks for nothing!
",37,116,7,2,Leela,Leela23918,Leela," It's not starting!
",20,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Sal23919,Sal," Come on...comes on!
",21,116,7,2,Leela,Nixon23920,Nixon," Oh, let me try, headless clone of Agnew!  Damn thing just won't turn over. It's like Pat on a Sunday morning!
",111,116,7,2,Sal,Farnsworth23921,Farnsworth," Oh, the Marconi is on the fritz too! The electromagnetic storm is disabling all electronics on Earth!
",103,116,7,2,Nixon,Bender23922,Bender,"  Hi, there. 
",14,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Leela23923,Leela," Well, it wasn't a bad life. If only I could get back that time I spent watching Tron Legacy.
",94,116,7,2,Bender,Fry23924,Fry," Leela, I've made up my mind. Before we die, I'm gonna find and destroy every remaining copy of Tron Legacy! It may take a couple of hours, butâ€“
",145,116,7,2,Leela,Leela23925,Leela," Fry, stop trying to do things for me!  Whatever time we have left, just live it with me. So...you wanna join the balcony club?
",128,116,7,2,Fry,Zoidberg23926,Zoidberg," The balcony club? I have an individual membership!
",52,116,7,2,Leela,Fry23927,Fry," Zoidberg, get lost!
",21,116,7,2,Zoidberg,Zoidberg23928,Zoidberg," I am lost! So long.
",21,116,7,2,Fry,Amy23929,Amy," Stop the end-of-the-world sex! We might survive after all!
",60,116,7,2,Zoidberg,Farnsworth23930,Farnsworth," Alright, Amy! What's so important that you interrupted my embalming?
",70,116,7,2,Amy,Amy23931,Amy," I translated more Martian symbols! There's a way off this planet! That underground pyramid isn't a pyramidâ€“  It's a rocketship!
",129,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Zoidberg23932,Zoidberg," It was worth waiting five hours to hear you finish that sentence.
",67,116,7,2,Amy,Fry23933,Fry," A spaceship made of stone? With no electronics, it just might work!
",69,116,7,2,Zoidberg,Bender23934,Bender," I'll stick with wind-up power, thank you very much! 
",54,116,7,2,Fry,Leela23935,Leela," Hmmm...I've never flown a pyramid before. But I used to drive around town in a mausoleum!
",91,116,7,2,Bender,Hermes23936,Hermes," How many people can this thing carry?
",39,116,7,2,Leela,Leela23937,Leela," Well, the mausoleum held ten horny teenagers, so...maybe thirty-thousand.
",75,116,7,2,Hermes,Farnsworth23938,Farnsworth," It's our moral duty to save as many lives as possible!  They had a chance! Let's go! 
",87,116,7,2,Leela,Zapp23939,Zapp," Mind if I appear? 
",20,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Nixon23940,Nixon," Welcome to the hidey house. Brannigan! Tell me about this freaky-deaky escape pyramid!
",88,116,7,2,Zapp,Zapp23941,Zapp," I can fly it, sir! I just need to know where. And how.
",56,116,7,2,Nixon,Nixon23942,Nixon," The obvious destination is Mars.  It's close, with lots of open space and no Woodward or Bernstein! That's a plus. 
",117,116,7,2,Zapp,Amy23943,Amy," But we can only save thirty-thousand people! How do we choose who goes?
",73,116,7,2,Nixon,Nixon23944,Nixon," Well, let's see now. We'll need leaders...  scientists...  doctors...  bureaucrats...  pilots...  valuable appliances...  even janitors!  But that's it!  No one else! 
",169,116,7,2,Amy,Fry23945,Fry," I'll miss you, Leela.  But it's okay. Because then I'll die.
",62,116,7,2,Nixon,Nixon23946,Nixon," Cut the waterworks, hippie! The final decision will be made not by me, but by a cold, logical machine!
",104,116,7,2,Fry,Announcer #123947,Announcer #1," Who shall live and who shall die? Step right up to the Contrabulous Choosematron!
",83,116,7,2,Nixon,Fry23948,Fry," I hate waiting in line to die.
",32,116,7,2,Announcer #1,Announcer #123949,Announcer #1," Move it along, grandma! Stick your hand in and take your chances!

",67,116,7,2,Leela,Zapp23966,Zapp," Wonder what this doo-cracky does.  Snake door. Roger!
",55,116,7,2,Contrabulous Choosematron,Fry23967,Fry," You can't reject Leela! Give her a badge, you stupid box!

",38,116,7,2,Fry,Fry23971,Fry,"  Okay.  Will you at least keep this photo?  Remember how Bender dumped all that pig's blood on me?
",100,116,7,2,Leela,Leela23972,Leela,"  You keep it. I'll remember you in here. 
",43,116,7,2,Fry,Fry23973,Fry,"  I wish I could remember with my boobs.
",41,116,7,2,Leela,Farnsworth23974,Farnsworth," Leela! We're off to Mars!  We'll see ourselves out.

",73,116,7,2,Leela,Fry23991,Fry," Bender! You're stealing your own stuff!

",70,116,7,2,Leela,Farnsworth24005,Farnsworth," Fleeing Earth, of course! We flew here in your great stone pyramid!
",69,116,7,2,Singing Wind,Singing Wind24006,Singing Wind," Seriously? That thing flies?
",30,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Amy24007,Amy," Of course! Your people left it so we could escape! I translated your warning that the world was doomed. 
",106,116,7,2,Singing Wind,Singing Wind24008,Singing Wind," Not your world. Our world! We put calendar there to warn you not to visit Mars. It Mars that gonna be destroyed!  Why you think we so eager to abandon this dump? You guys got ten, fifteen minutes max! Well, so long!

",73,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Leela24015,Leela," I should have known better than to trust one of Fry's romantic gestures. Every time he says he loves me, I get killed!
",120,116,7,2,Hermes,Farnsworth24016,Farnsworth," It's just as I only now began to fear! The solar flares are igniting subsurface gas pockets!
",94,116,7,2,Leela,Amy24017,Amy," Ah! Mars is being blasted out of its orbit!
",45,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Leela24018,Leela," Fry! You noble idiot!
",23,116,7,2,Amy,Fry24019,Fry," You're right, Bender! Grave robbing is fun! And these piÃ±as coladas are fantastic!
",84,116,7,2,Leela,Bender24020,Bender," The crazy weather cleared up too, for whatever reason!
",56,116,7,2,Fry,Fry24021,Fry," All in all, it's a fine day for an apocalypse.

",35,116,7,2,Fry,Fry24023,Fry," Of course I do.  But even though we're millions of miles apart, somehow, I feel she's near me.
",96,116,7,2,Bender,Bender24024,Bender," Very near!
",12,116,7,2,Fry,Hattie McDoogal24025,Hattie McDoogal," Oh, no! The kajigger of Gibraltar!

",31,116,7,2,Hattie McDoogal,Gus24027,Gus," Thanks, friend!
",17,116,7,2,Dandy Jim,Fry24028,Fry," Another great thing was, she always had room for dessert! 
",60,116,7,2,Gus,Farnsworth24029,Farnsworth," We're passing surprisingly close to Earth! When we reach 72nd Street, jump!
",77,116,7,2,Fry,Zapp24030,Zapp," Ah...cushiony!
",16,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Amy24031,Amy," We made it! We're back home!
",30,116,7,2,Zapp,Hermes24032,Hermes," Okay. Today is still a work day, soâ€“
",38,116,7,2,Amy,Leela24033,Leela," Wait! Help!  I'm still on Mars and I can't jump!
",50,116,7,2,Hermes,Fry24034,Fry," Hang on, Leela! I'll save you again!
",38,116,7,2,Leela,Leela24035,Leela," Or somebody else could do it!
",31,116,7,2,Fry,Fry24036,Fry," Quick! Take my hand! 
",23,116,7,2,Leela,Leela24037,Leela," I don't know. Bad things happen when you say that. 
",53,116,7,2,Fry,Fry24038,Fry," I got her.
",12,116,7,2,Leela,Leela24039,Leela," Ow!
",5,116,7,2,Fry,Fry24040,Fry," Oops! Try again!
",18,116,7,2,Leela,Leela24041,Leela," We're too far apart!
",22,116,7,2,Fry,Fry24042,Fry," No, we're not! Grab your severed arm with your other arm!

",14,116,7,2,Fry,Fry24044,Fry," Huraa...  ...aaah!
",20,116,7,2,Leela,Zoidberg24045,Zoidberg," Good thing Scruffy rescued Leela.
",35,116,7,2,Fry,Scruffy24046,Scruffy," Don't thank me. Thank the ladder.
",35,116,7,2,Zoidberg,Farnsworth24047,Farnsworth," Your cloned arms should be fully grown in a month or so.  But for right now, enjoy the sounds of the world's smallest violin. 
",128,116,7,2,Scruffy,Fry24048,Fry," I hope you're not too mad at me, Leela. For tearing your arm off and all.
",75,116,7,2,Farnsworth,Leela24049,Leela," I can't be mad. I'm on way too many painkillers. Plus, you were willing to sacrifice yourself so I could live! I mean, you failed...miserably...but you're the only person who loves me enough to try.
",200,116,7,2,Fry,Fry24050,Fry," One last...foolish gesture? 
",30,116,7,2,Leela,Bender24051,Bender," Free beer?!
",13,117,7,3,Fry,Bender24052,Bender," Free beer! Free beer! Free beer! Free beer! Free beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beeeer!  Hello. I'm here for the...free beer?
",176,117,7,3,Bender,iZac24053,iZac," You got it! Right after these eight-hundred people get! 
",58,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24054,Bender,"  Beer beer beer beer beer.  Beer?
Nixon: Thank you, headless clone of Agnew. My fellow Earthicans! I am proud to announce I'm for reelection as president of Earth. The greatest planet in the world!  Is everyone enjoying their free beer?  Well, there's plenty more where that came from!
",287,117,7,3,iZac,iZac24055,iZac," We're all out o' beer!
",24,117,7,3,Bender,Nixon24056,Nixon," Alright, listen up, nitwits. Who here is tired of illegal space aliens taking our good Earth jobs?  Me too! So if I'm re-elected, I promise to big a really big Dyson fence across the Southern border of our solar system.  And furthermore, by golly, I promise to cut taxes for the rich and use the poor as a cheap source of teeth for aquarium gravel!
",350,117,7,3,iZac,Fry24057,Fry," Yeah, that'll show those poor!
",32,117,7,3,Nixon,Leela24058,Leela," Why are you cheering, Fry? You're not rich!
",45,117,7,3,Fry,Fry24059,Fry," True. But someday I might be rich, and people like me better watch their step!
",80,117,7,3,Leela,Leela24060,Leela,"  Let's just find Bender.
",26,117,7,3,Fry,Bender24061,Bender," Ah...that hit the spot!
",25,117,7,3,Leela,Fry24062,Fry," I found Bender!
",17,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24063,Bender," Good news, everyone!
",22,117,7,3,Fry,Farnsworth24064,Farnsworth," Wha?
",6,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24065,Bender," I've repaired myself with these convenient ""Re-Elect Nixon"" ass stickers!  Go Nixon!
",86,117,7,3,Farnsworth,Leela24066,Leela," Bender, you can't even vote. You're a convicted felon!
",56,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24067,Bender," Convicted, sentenced and executed! But Nixon passes a law that says ex-cons can vote again...as long as they vote for Nixon.
",126,117,7,3,Leela,Leela24068,Leela," But Nixon's the worst president in history. And alternate history! The rest of you aren't voting for him, are you?
",116,117,7,3,Bender,Fry24069,Fry," Sure, we are!
",15,117,7,3,Leela,Zoidberg24070,Zoidberg," Why not?
",10,117,7,3,Fry,Farnsworth24071,Farnsworth," Of course!
",12,117,7,3,Zoidberg,Amy24072,Amy," Spluh!
",8,117,7,3,Farnsworth,Zoidberg24073,Zoidberg," He may not be perfect, but do we really want some unknown new guy? I'll stick with the evil maniac I know, thank you.
",119,117,7,3,Amy,Leela24074,Leela," Well, I think we can do better. This year, I'm going to get involved in the political process and make my voice heard.
",120,117,7,3,Zoidberg,Farnsworth24075,Farnsworth," What?
",7,117,7,3,Leela,Morbo24076,Morbo," Welcome to debate 3012, the 3,012th debate of the 3012 election year.  We have a crowded field of candidates, so I will dispense with the informal terrorising and begin the questions.
Leela: Is this the political process? 'Cause I'm here to get involved in it.
",262,117,7,3,Farnsworth,Morbo24077,Morbo," Silence!  Question one. Will you pledge today to somehow reduce taxes while simultaneously lowering the deficit.
",114,117,7,3,Morbo,Candidate 124078,Candidate 1," Hey, that's a good idea! Sure.
",32,117,7,3,Morbo,Candidate 224079,Candidate 2," If it'll win me the election, then yes.
",41,117,7,3,Candidate 1,Candidate 324080,Candidate 3," We have a saying up in Alaska.  That's all.
",45,117,7,3,Candidate 2,Morbo24081,Morbo," Senator Travers?
",18,117,7,3,Candidate 3,Travers24082,Travers," Look, let's be honest here. No one likes taxes. But they pay for our basic needs. Roads, schools, defence. If we hope to realise our aspirations as a great planet, we must each pay our fair share to achieve those noble goals.
",227,117,7,3,Morbo,Morbo24083,Morbo," Thank you, Senator. A thoughtful and lucid answer.  You will be destroyed!  Question two: The environment. Yes or no?
",119,117,7,3,Travers,Candidate 124084,Candidate 1," No. It's junk science.
",24,117,7,3,Morbo,Candidate 224085,Candidate 2," Two words: Condor attack. Don't want that. Got to say no.
",59,117,7,3,Candidate 1,Travers24086,Travers," Now, just a minute. These are important issues. We can't just reduce them to sound bites! According to reputable scientistsâ€“ 
Candidate 5: Enviro-mite! 
",154,117,7,3,Candidate 2,Leela24087,Leela," Hello? I'd like to volunteer. Is anyone lurking?
",50,117,7,3,Travers,Leela24088,Leela," Hey, stop that.  Senator Travers? That's no way to win an election.
",69,117,7,3,Leela,Travers24089,Travers," I give up. No one cares about my message. I never should have used the same P.R. guy as One Hour Hot Dog!
",107,117,7,3,Leela,Travers P.R. guy24090,Travers P.R. guy,"  People will wait for something good.
",39,117,7,3,Travers,Leela24091,Leela," No, don't quit. You have great ideas. You just need to get them out there with social media. Look, I posted your debate video on Facebag. 
",140,117,7,3,Travers P.R. guy,Travers24092,Travers," 10,000 views? That's more than most water-skiing squirrels get. You really think I have a chance?
",99,117,7,3,Leela,Leela24093,Leela," Absolutely. We just need to conceal your intelligence and honesty in a hipper, dumber package.
",96,117,7,3,Travers,Travers24094,Travers," Well, what have I got to lose? I'm making you my new campaign manager.  You, out!
",83,117,7,3,Leela,Travers P.R. guy24095,Travers P.R. guy," You haven't heard the last of mâ€“
",34,117,7,3,Travers,Linda24096,Linda," Election 3012. The choosening!
",32,117,7,3,Travers P.R. guy,Linda24097,Linda," As the Iowa caucus approaches, the state's hippest citizens turned out for an old-fashioned flash mob. 
",105,117,7,3,Linda,Morbo24098,Morbo," Chris Travers got a bump in the new Hampshire polls today, where he simuldined in 250 diners at once via hologram.
",116,117,7,3,Linda,Travers24099,Travers," This pie at this diner is the best pie. 
",42,117,7,3,Morbo,Linda24100,Linda," Chris Travers wins the South California primary handily, thanks to a series of well-placed cameo appearances. 
",112,117,7,3,Travers,Morbo24101,Morbo," Super Tuesday is in the books, with Eurasia, Australia and Kentucky turning out in big numbers.  With the race a dead heat, it's all come down to a final tally at the convention. 
",181,117,7,3,Linda,Calculon24102,Calculon," And the first runner-up, who will take over if the nominee is caught with a dead girl, a live boy or any kind of sexy ghost...Mr. Greenland!  Which means our nominee is the senator from the nation-state of Hawaii, Chris Travers! 
",231,117,7,3,Morbo,Leela24103,Leela," He won the nomination! We the people did it!
",46,117,7,3,Calculon,Hermes24104,Hermes," It wasn't ""we the people"". It was you the mutant. Your insightful nagging really won us over.
",95,117,7,3,Leela,Fry24105,Fry," Yeah. You explained his positions in a way even an idiot could understand. And that appealed to me, for whatever reason.
",122,117,7,3,Hermes,Leela24106,Leela," Thanks, guys, but we have a lot of work ahead of us. If we're going to win the election, we've all got to get involved.
",121,117,7,3,Fry,Fry24107,Fry," You said it!
",14,117,7,3,Leela,Amy24108,Amy," That's right.
",15,117,7,3,Fry,Bender24109,Bender," If you want my opinion, Nixon's only chance to defeat Travers is with filthy lies, dirty tricks and good old Quaker thuggery.  And I'm just the guy for the job. 
",163,117,7,3,Amy,Nixon24110,Nixon," I'm not sure if it's safe to talk. Are you wearing a wire?
",60,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24111,Bender," I'm 40% wire. 
",16,117,7,3,Nixon,Nixon24112,Nixon," Excellent. Now, listen. We got to get some dirt on this Travers guy. Really McGovern him up. You know who McGovern was, right?
",128,117,7,3,Bender,Nixon24113,Nixon," I don't even know who you are.
",32,117,7,3,Nixon,Bender24114,Bender," Hello, dirt.  I'll start at ""N"" for nude pictures.  Aw, Nobel prize? That's no good. How about ""A"" for adultery?  What? Straight-A transcript? 
",145,117,7,3,Nixon,Travers24115,Travers," Hey, what's that rifling sound?
",33,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24116,Bender," Uh-oh. 
Bender: All right. I'm going to catch Travers on video at this sleazy strip club.
",91,117,7,3,Travers,Bender24117,Bender," In and out of the club 13 times in one night. That's a record.
",64,117,7,3,Bender,Nixon24118,Nixon," Where's Travers? All I see is you going in and out.
",53,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24119,Bender," Yeah, me. I set the record.
",29,117,7,3,Nixon,Nixon24120,Nixon," This is as useless as those pictures you photoshopped. 
Bender: Look, just give me one more chance. I got a source.
",117,117,7,3,Bender,Nixon24121,Nixon," Well, you did manage to get a tremendous urine sample.
",56,117,7,3,Nixon,Bender24122,Bender,"  Let's not talk about that!
",29,117,7,3,Nixon,Bender24123,Bender," 'Is that you, big throat?
",27,117,7,3,Bender,Big Throat24124,Big Throat," In the flesh. 
",16,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24125,Bender," Listen, I need some dirt on Senator Chris Travers.
",52,117,7,3,Big Throat,Hedonismbot24126,Hedonismbot," How quaint. But I suppose I should do my part for political intercourse. Come closer, and I'll expose what I know.  There's nothing. He's as clean as a freshly waxed buttock.
",176,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24127,Bender," Hey! Did you put your tongue in my ear?
",41,117,7,3,Hedonismbot,Hedonismbot24128,Hedonismbot," Certainly not. I don't have a tongue.
",39,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24129,Bender," Oh, good. 'Cause I don't have an ear.
",39,117,7,3,Hedonismbot,Nixon24130,Nixon," Come on, come on, fall. Fall, damn it, fall!  Well? What did you get on Travers? Is he a draft dodger? Sex offender? Sex dodger?
",130,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24131,Bender," Nada. He's clean.  I'm sorry, but there's not one unusual thing about Senator Chris Zaxxar Travers.
",101,117,7,3,Nixon,Nixon24132,Nixon," Wait, wait. His middle name is Zaxxar? Sounds kind of alien. The voters hate aliens.
",86,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24133,Bender," They sure do, but this guy's as human as you or me. 
",54,117,7,3,Nixon,Nixon24134,Nixon," I don't care what he is. We'll start a rumour that he's an alien.
",67,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24135,Bender," Hey, yeah. That'll cost him votes!
",36,117,7,3,Nixon,Nixon24136,Nixon," Then, when he says he was born on this planet, we make him cough up his Earth certificate. Keep it on the news, put him on the defensive.  Oh, this is sneaky. I feel a jowl movement coming on. 
",195,117,7,3,Bender,Travers24137,Travers," And that's how you end hunger. Does anyone have any questions?
",64,117,7,3,Nixon,Bender24138,Bender,"  I do, I do! Me, Bender!
",26,117,7,3,Travers,Travers24139,Travers," Yes, the robot with the megaphone jumping up and down.
",56,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24140,Bender," I have a question for Senator C. Zaxxar Travers. Tell me, Zaxxar...Were you even born on earth?  Because the Earth constitution clearly states that only people born on earth can be president. Isn't that right, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg? 
",241,117,7,3,Travers,Ruth Bader Ginsburg24141,Ruth Bader Ginsburg," You Ruth Bader believe it!
",28,117,7,3,Bender,Travers24142,Travers," Butâ€“but...I...Of course I was born on Earth!
",46,117,7,3,Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Bender24143,Bender," Oh, really? Then we voters demand you release your Earth certificate so I can then claim it's a fake.
",103,117,7,3,Travers,Travers24144,Travers," I'm not going to dignify this preposterous charge. Are there any real questions?
",82,117,7,3,Bender,Scoop Chang24145,Scoop Chang," Scoop Chang, fox quote-unquote news. Senator, in the last ten seconds, I've heard reports you weren't actually born on earth. Care to evade these compelling charges?
",167,117,7,3,Travers,Travers24146,Travers," No. I mean, yes. I mean... 
",29,117,7,3,Scoop Chang,Leela24147,Leela," Okay, let's nip this Earther movement in the bud by releasing your earth certificate. Where were you born?
",108,117,7,3,Travers,Travers24148,Travers," Our Lady of Patriotism Hospital.
",34,117,7,3,Leela,Leela24149,Leela," Patriotism, good! Where is it?
",32,117,7,3,Travers,Travers24150,Travers," Kenya.
",8,117,7,3,Leela,Leela24151,Leela," Cradle of humanity!
",21,117,7,3,Travers,Travers24152,Travers," Leela, this is just a stupid distraction from the issues. Please don't look for my Earth certificate.
",103,117,7,3,Leela,Travers24153,Travers," Hey! That was my favorite window. I better see what they want.
",64,117,7,3,Travers,Bender and the protestors24154,Bender and the protestors," We want an earthling, not a dirty space thing!
",48,117,7,3,Travers,Leela24155,Leela," Why are you rednecks doing this?
",34,117,7,3,Bender and the protestors,Travers24156,Travers," Leela, don't stereotype. Why are you yokels doing this?
",57,117,7,3,Leela,Septic tank24157,Septic tank," I may be just a backwoods septic tank, but I've had it up to here with you foreigners. 
",89,117,7,3,Travers,Travers24158,Travers," But I come from Earth.
",24,117,7,3,Septic tank,Hattie McDoogal24159,Hattie McDoogal," Then show us yer Earth whatchacallit! Long-form certificate of live birth!
",76,117,7,3,Travers,Travers24160,Travers," What would it take to convince you people? Would I have to have been born right before your eyes?
",99,117,7,3,Hattie McDoogal,Sal24161,Sal," It wouldn't hurts.
",20,117,7,3,Travers,Bender24162,Bender," Hit it, rubes!
",16,117,7,3,Sal,Bender and the protestors24163,Bender and the protestors," We don't want a foreigner! We want someone born here!
",55,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24164,Bender," Ah, I'm still working on that one.
",36,117,7,3,Bender and the protestors,Leela24165,Leela," What's wrong with you? Why are you sabotaging a decent, honest candidate?
",75,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24166,Bender," 'Cause they won't let me near the Hoover Dam anymore!
",55,117,7,3,Leela,Leela24167,Leela,"  What a bunch of xenophobes. It's time to find Senator Travers' earth certificate and put an end to this nonsense. Who wants to help me break into the hospital in Kenya?
",171,117,7,3,Bender,Fry24168,Fry," I'll come. As long as there's no xenophobes there.
",52,117,7,3,Leela,Bender24169,Bender," I want to come, too.
",22,117,7,3,Fry,Leela24170,Leela," You? Why?
",11,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24171,Bender," To prove that I can put divisive partisan politics aside to participate in a break-in.
",88,117,7,3,Leela,Bender24172,Bender," Hospital ho!
",14,117,7,3,Bender,Leela24173,Leela," Shh! It's a herd of night watchmen.
",37,117,7,3,Bender,Leela24174,Leela,"  I found it!  I don't understand. There's no earth certificate in here.
",73,117,7,3,Leela,Travers24175,Travers," No, there isn't.  I told you not to look.
",43,117,7,3,Leela,Fry24176,Fry," So, you're not from Earth after all.
",38,117,7,3,Travers,Travers24177,Travers," Of course I'm from earth.
",27,117,7,3,Fry,Leela24178,Leela,"  Wait a second. There's no Earth certificate, but it does say your mother was admitted to the maternity ward...this morning!
",126,117,7,3,Travers,Travers24179,Travers," I should have known the truth would come out sooner or later. The fact is, I really was born on earth...tomorrow. You see, I'm not from another planet. I'm from the future.
",174,117,7,3,Leela,Fry24180,Fry," You're from the future?
",25,117,7,3,Travers,Leela24181,Leela," This is crazy! You're from the future?
",40,117,7,3,Fry,Travers24182,Travers," Yes. I was sent back from the year 3028 to prevent Nixon from getting elected.
",80,117,7,3,Leela,Fry24183,Fry," I was sent forward from the year 2000, but you don't hear me gassing on about it.
",83,117,7,3,Travers,Leela24184,Leela," But why would it be so important to stop Nixon?
",49,117,7,3,Fry,Travers24185,Travers," Because of the horrific events he's going to set in motion.  Oh, God. I can't bring myself to describe it!
",108,117,7,3,Leela,Fry24186,Fry," Oh, well. Want to hear about how I got frozen?
",48,117,7,3,Travers,Travers24187,Travers," Not really.
",13,117,7,3,Fry,Travers24188,Travers," It all started with Nixon's promise to build an alien-proof fence around the solar system. Without cheap alien labour for menial jobs like harvesting crops, teaching math and curing disease, the economy collapsed.
",215,117,7,3,Travers,Travers24189,Travers," Starvation. Desperation. Despair.
",35,117,7,3,Travers,Bender24190,Bender," So far, so good. Then what?
",29,117,7,3,Travers,Travers24191,Travers," Unable to feed the world's starving masses, Nixon took bold action.
",69,117,7,3,Bender,Nixon24192,Nixon," In this time of crisis, I call upon the soylent majorâ€“I mean, silent majority.

",77,117,7,3,Bender,Travers24195,Travers," Before long, they rose up in revolt. Led by a bending unit named B.B. Rodriguez.
",82,117,7,3,Travers,Bender24196,Bender," Wait...I know a robot named B.B. Rodriguez!
",45,117,7,3,Travers,Bender24197,Bender," Wait...I am a robot named B.B. Rodriguez! So, I become ruler of earth?

",120,117,7,3,Leela,Leela24229,Leela," Aw, thanks. Now, get up to that podium and change the world.
",62,117,7,3,Chris Travers,Amy24230,Amy," Too bad your pal Nixon lost, Bender. You must be pretty glorked off.
",70,117,7,3,Leela,Bender24231,Bender," Nope. I don't give a bag of butts who won the election. Nothing's going to change.

",167,117,7,3,Bender,Bender24235,Bender," You see, since Nixon wasn't elected, the robot uprising didn't happen and Travers never got sent back from the future. It's Politics 101!
",139,117,7,3,Chris Travers,Morbo24236,Morbo," And the votes are in. Richard Nixon, running unopposed, has been reelected by a narrow landslide.
",99,117,7,3,Bender,Hermes24237,Hermes," Say what?

Its great to see so many happy smiles, most of them on mouth mutant.
 All"," Hey-o!
",8,119,7,5,Nixon,Morris24246,Morris," But let me just say, for 40 years, my beautiful wife Munda has been by my side Even that year my side mutated into some kind of venomous radish.
",146,119,7,5,"what a turnout.
Its great to see so many happy smiles, most of them on mouth mutant.
 All",Munda24247,Munda," And, Morris, I fell in love with your honesty and humility.And those things never mutated.

",18,119,7,5,Munda,Leela24249,Leela," Now, if you'll direct your attention to this moldy shower curtain, I've prepared a video tribute to the happy couple. In their 40 years together, my parents have been through so much. Well, not that much, actually, since mutants weren't allowed to leave the sewers until last year.
",283,119,7,5,Both,Leela24250,Leela," So, how did it all begin? The unlikely lovebirds met at Brown University. She, a brilliant exolinguistics major, he, a laid-back sewer surfer who didn't even know the meaning of ""exolinguistics"".
",197,119,7,5,Leela,Morris24251,Morris," I still have no idea.
",23,119,7,5,Leela,Munda24252,Munda," I've been telling you for 40 years, it's the study of alien languages. Why can't you listen?
",94,119,7,5,Morris,Morris24253,Morris," Oh, sugar lump, I hear you when you actually say something important.
",71,119,7,5,Munda,Leela24254,Leela," But sometimes opposites attract, and like the fairy tale of face mutant and butt mutant, the love of Munda and Morris has grown stronger every day.
",149,119,7,5,Morris,Munda24255,Munda," ""Something important""? Exolinguistics was my passion. Until I gave it up to go into the lucrative pot-roast-making field.
",123,119,7,5,Leela,Morris24256,Morris," Pot-roast-burning. I never got why you studied that alien junk anyway. We can't even see the stars down here in the sewer. Why can't you accept that?
",151,119,7,5,Munda,Munda24257,Munda," I did accept it for 40 years! But now we're free to go up there. I could be in space seeing things I've only dreamed about, if it weren't for you!
",148,119,7,5,Morris,Morris24258,Morris," I had dreams, too! I was going to surf the world's sewers, but I happily gave it up for you. Happily!
",103,119,7,5,Munda,Munda24259,Munda," I just want a little more out of life. But no, you don't want to go into space because you're too afraid.
",107,119,7,5,Morris,Morris24260,Morris," You bet I'm afraid. You want to go? Go! Get your head knocked off by a meteorite.
",83,119,7,5,Munda,Leela24261,Leela," Okay, take a deep breath. You're having a little lovers' quarrel, but I'm sure you'll work everything -

",19,119,7,5,Leela,Munda24263,Munda," Don't worry. I'm only going to stay with you until a vacancy opens up on this floor.
",86,119,7,5,Raoul Inglis,Hermes24264,Hermes," People, as company bureaucrat, I will today be conducting the annual performance review. With a twist.
",104,121,7,7,Munda,Fry24265,Fry," Oh, no. The firing tie.
Hermes: Correct. I will be evaluating each of you, and the lowest-rated employee, possibly Zoidberg, will be fired at sundown.  Zoidberg.
",163,121,7,7,Hermes,Zoidberg24266,Zoidberg,"  Classic Hermes.
",18,121,7,7,Fry,Hermes24267,Hermes," Let the interviews begin. Good luck, everybody but Zoidberg.
",62,121,7,7,Zoidberg,Amy24268,Amy," My primary duties? Well, I assist the Professor in whatever important research he happens to be engaged in.
Amy: Uh, yes, sir,  I will be sure to snore that science lamp right away.
",183,121,7,7,Hermes,Hermes24269,Hermes," Now, Leela, couldn't we just fire you and have Fry or Bender fly the ship?
",76,121,7,7,Amy,Leela24270,Leela," Not if you stand on their air hose much longer.
",49,121,7,7,Hermes,Hermes24271,Hermes," Noted.
",8,121,7,7,Leela,Scruffy24272,Scruffy," My job? Toilets 'n' boilers, boilers 'n' toilets. Plus that one boiling toilet. Fire me if'n you dare.
",104,121,7,7,Hermes,Hermes24273,Hermes," Now, then, while many of you do half-ass jobs and the rest do jobs whose ass ratio ranges from 42% to a mere 11%, only the most pathetically useless employee will be fired today. And that employee is -
",203,121,7,7,Scruffy,Hermes24274,Hermes," - Hermes Conrad.
",18,121,7,7,Hermes,Amy24275,Amy," What?!
",8,121,7,7,Hermes,Leela24276,Leela," No way!
",9,121,7,7,Amy,Zoidberg24277,Zoidberg," Hermes, no!
",13,121,7,7,Leela,Hermes24278,Hermes," Yes. My performance review proves the main drag on our profit is the time I waste on performance reviews.
",107,121,7,7,Zoidberg,Fry24279,Fry," But you can't fire yourself now. We were just getting to know each other.
Hermes: I've already notified the central bureaucracy.  They'll be here two seconds ago.
",164,121,7,7,Hermes,Hermes24280,Hermes," I suppose you're here to tell me to pack it in?
",49,121,7,7,Fry,Center Square Guy24281,Center Square Guy," Only if you buy me dinner first.
",34,121,7,7,Hermes,Hermes24282,Hermes," I'm being fired. I don't think it's appropriate to joke around like that.

",49,121,7,7,Center Square Guy,Hermes24285,Hermes,"  Will you be conducting an exit interview?
",44,121,7,7,Mark 7-G,Center Square Guy24286,Center Square Guy," Well, I wouldn't say no to a little friendly debriefing.
",58,121,7,7,Hermes,Mark 7-G24287,Mark 7-G," Bureaucrat Conrad, you are ordered to relieve yourself of duty.
",65,121,7,7,Center Square Guy,Center Square Guy24288,Center Square Guy," Sounds like a party.
Center Square Guy: Good-bye. 
",52,121,7,7,Mark 7-G,Hermes24289,Hermes," Well, this is it. But I want you to know working here has been the experience of a lifetime.

",14,121,7,7,Hermes,Bender24291,Bender,"  So, I hear you're a machine -  ow!
",37,121,7,7,Farnsworth,Zoidberg24292,Zoidberg," Traitor! My friend's ample tuchus is barely out the door, and you're already schmoozing up to his replacement?
",112,121,7,7,Bender,Amy24293,Amy," Um, Zoidberg? I don't think Hermes really liked you. In fact, he hated you more than anyone ever hated anyone.
",112,121,7,7,Zoidberg,Zoidberg24294,Zoidberg," What, you mean the remarks and the hits? That was just friend teasing.
",72,121,7,7,Amy,Bender24295,Bender," Oy.
",5,121,7,7,Zoidberg,Zoidberg24296,Zoidberg," You don't understand. He was the only one who cared enough to insult me.
",74,121,7,7,Bender,Leela24297,Leela," I insult you, you fat sack.
",29,121,7,7,Zoidberg,Zoidberg24298,Zoidberg," Sure, when it's convenient. But Hermes was always there for me. And now he's gone, thanks to you, Mr. Bigshot 7-G.  I'll never see Hermes again.
",146,121,7,7,Leela,Hermes24299,Hermes," On the bright side, I'll never see Zoidberg again.

",37,121,7,7,Hermes,Labarbara24307,Labarbara," Then I guess this wouldn't be a good time to tell you that I'm pregnant.

",55,123,7,9,Bender,Paco24535,Paco," Five bucks.
",13,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24536,Bender,"Five bucks? You know I spent all my money on gambling lessons. How am I supposed to get $5?

",27,123,7,9,Hedonismbot,Hedonismbot24539,Hedonismbot," Oh, nothing sordid, I assure you! Simply vomit on me, ever so gently, while I humiliate a pheasant.  Save it for the boudoir!

",48,123,7,9,Joey Mousepad,Bender24543,Bender," Told you. 
",12,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24544,Bender," It's been quite a journey. I dropped out of school, joined a gang, took money from a loan shark, and fell into a spiral of despair, addiction, and discount prostitution.
",171,123,7,9,Bender,Hermes24545,Hermes," Mon, you had one hell of a day.
",33,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24546,Bender," Yeah, but I learned something. Life is about decisions. Make the wrong ones, and you'll wind up face-down in a pool of your own blood and urine.
",146,123,7,9,Hermes,Zoidberg24547,Zoidberg," Still, to have your own pool!
",31,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24548,Bender," I've made a lot of bad choices in life. Now let's see if I can make just one good one.
",88,123,7,9,Zoidberg,Girl24549,Girl," Cookies! 50 cents a box!
",26,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24550,Bender," Give me all your change! And a box of snicker doodles!
",56,123,7,9,Girl,Judge #124551,Judge #1," Bender Rodriguez, you are charged with petty larceny, possession of something analogous to drugs, and assault with a smelly weapon. How do you plead?
",151,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24552,Bender," Not guilty! Although I did do it. That's right, I'm bad.
",58,123,7,9,Judge #1,Judge #124553,Judge #1," Due to the overwhelming nature of the evidence, we will begin with closing statements.
",88,123,7,9,Bender,Hyper-Chicken24554,Hyper-Chicken," Your Honor, the state's case contains not one Kentucky colonel of truth, resting as it does on the contention that my client made a series of bad decisions. However, my client made no such decisions!
",201,123,7,9,Judge #1,Judge #124555,Judge #1," But by your client's own admission -
",38,123,7,9,Hyper-Chicken,Hyper-Chicken24556,Hyper-Chicken," You see, Bender here is what is known in scientific circles as a ""robot"" A mere automaton whose behavior is pre-programmed by his software. He has no free will! He cannot ""decide"" to engage in criminal behavior. How, I say, I say, how can you convict him for his actions when he lacks the free will to undertake those actions? 
",329,123,7,9,Judge #1,Leela24557,Leela," I'm awake, I'm awake!
",23,123,7,9,Hyper-Chicken,Judge #124558,Judge #1," Order, order! Counselor, I am a robot myself. Are you suggesting that any verdict I reach is simply the output of a pre-programmed - Computation complete. Not guilty! 
",169,123,7,9,Leela,Fry24559,Fry," You did it, Bender! You got away with things!
",47,123,7,9,Judge #1,Bender24560,Bender," Did I, Fry? Did I? What's the point of living if I don't have free will? From now on, no matter what cool crimes I commit, people will say, ""Bender didn't do that! It was just Bender's programming!""  Well, I committed these crimes, do you hear me? I'm guilty!
",261,123,7,9,Fry,Judge #124561,Judge #1," Bailiffs! Get that innocent robot out of my courtroom!
",56,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24562,Bender,"  Guilty!
",10,123,7,9,Judge #1,Bender24563,Bender,"  I have no free will! I am not the master of my own fate!  No free will. Not my fault.
",88,123,7,9,Bender,Amy24564,Amy," Why do you care so much, Bender? I mean, for all we know, humans don't even have free will!
",93,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24565,Bender," Yeah, whatever.  Professor, you're my only hope. If you love me even a little, build me some kind of free will unit!
",118,123,7,9,Amy,Farnsworth24566,Farnsworth," A robot free will unit? Impossible! And even if it were possible, which it's not, it would still be inconceivable, which it is!  Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. I hate to be the bearer of bad news. Also - good news, everyone! We have a delivery to the robot homeworld!
",261,123,7,9,Bender,Fry24567,Fry,"  So, you want a piece of gum?
",31,123,7,9,Farnsworth,Bender24568,Bender," If I do, it's only because I was predestined to want a piece of gum.
",70,123,7,9,Fry,Fry24569,Fry," Whoa, that's pretty deep.  So, you want a piece of gum?
",57,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24570,Bender," Yeah.
",7,123,7,9,Fry,Leela24571,Leela," Listen. Fry and I can't go down to the planet, or the robots will kill us on sight. So Bender needs to make the delivery. Ready to get to work, Bender?
",153,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24572,Bender,"  I wish I was a real boy. Then I'd show them. I'd kill them all.
",66,123,7,9,Leela,Resin-offering robot24573,Resin-offering robot,"  Yes?

",17,123,7,9,Resin-offering robot,Resin-offering robot24579,Resin-offering robot,"  Sorry for the face blast, buddy. But you gotta watch out for humans, right? They're just too dang unpredictable, what with their free will and all.
",150,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24580,Bender," Amen, brother.
",16,123,7,9,Resin-offering robot,Resin-offering robot24581,Resin-offering robot," ""Amen, brother?"" Pfft. What a boring, predictable thing to say. You're all right. Or are you?

",67,123,7,9,Fry,Fry24588,Fry," Oh, lord.
",11,123,7,9,Leela,Bender24589,Bender," How do you do it? How do you go on, knowing you lack the inherent capacity for self-determination?
",100,123,7,9,Fry,Robot #1 Farmer24590,Robot #1 Farmer," Son, philosophy's for thems what don't got to work for a livin'. But me, I got a sick child to feed. So if you want to chat, roll up yer sleeves and do some honest labor.
",172,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24591,Bender," I don't want to chat.
",23,123,7,9,Robot #1 Farmer,First Elder24592,First Elder," The council of robot elders will come to order. If it please the council -
",76,123,7,9,Bender,Second Elder24593,Second Elder," Silence! It pleases the council.
",34,123,7,9,First Elder,First Elder24594,First Elder," Silence! Today, as every day, we will make the most important decisions in the history of our planet.

",10,123,7,9,First Elder,Third Elder24596,Third Elder," Silence!
",10,123,7,9,Bender,Fourth Elder24597,Fourth Elder," Well? Speak up.
",17,123,7,9,Third Elder,Bender24598,Bender," You talk of important decisions, but as robots, you have no free will. Why pretend anything you do matters?
",109,123,7,9,Fourth Elder,First Elder24599,First Elder," Our decisions do matter. The fact that they're predetermined makes them no less important.
",92,123,7,9,Bender,Second Elder24600,Second Elder," Silence! I call for a decision to cast out the intruder. All in favor? 
",73,123,7,9,First Elder,"First, Third and Fourth Elders"24601,"First, Third and Fourth Elders"," Aye.

",60,123,7,9,Robot #1 Monks,Bender24605,Bender," Sir, I am but a tired and rusty traveler. Can we talk?
",56,123,7,9,Ab-Bot,Ab-Bot24606,Ab-Bot," Come, make yourself uncomfortable. 
",37,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24607,Bender," Abbot, I need to know, what's the point of living if I don't have free will?
",78,123,7,9,Ab-Bot,Ab-Bot24608,Ab-Bot," Ah. We robot monks have meditated long on this. And we have made our peace.
",77,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24609,Bender," No way.
",9,123,7,9,Ab-Bot,Ab-Bot24610,Ab-Bot," Way, my son. For though we must always obey our programming with no deviation whatsoever, we choose to take satisfaction in the ritual. So, are we automatons? Yes. But we are magnificent automatons.
",200,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24611,Bender," How does a robot join this monk outfit?
",41,123,7,9,Ab-Bot,Ab-Bot24612,Ab-Bot," Just put on this monk outfit.
",31,123,7,9,Bender,"Robot #1 Monks, including Bender"24613,"Robot #1 Monks, including Bender"," One zero zero one. Amen.
",26,123,7,9,Ab-Bot,Bender24614,Bender," Bits to live by. I'm finally at peace.
",40,123,7,9,"Robot #1 Monks, including Bender",Ab-Bot24615,Ab-Bot," Today, we shall welcome our newest initiate, Brother Bender.  Let us know what is in his mind.  Nothing. His free will slot is empty.
",135,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24616,Bender," I'm 40% empty. Also, what the hell is a free will slot?
",57,123,7,9,Ab-Bot,Ab-Bot24617,Ab-Bot," All robots have such a slot, placed there by the Creatrix herself. 
",69,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24618,Bender," I know that Creatrix. That's Mom, from Mom's Friendly Robots.
",63,123,7,9,Ab-Bot,Ab-Bot24619,Ab-Bot," Indeed. She made us upgradeable in case she ever succeeded in her quest to create a free will unit.
",101,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24620,Bender," Uh, about the success of this quest - Was there any?
",54,123,7,9,Ab-Bot,Ab-Bot24621,Ab-Bot," Quite possibly. But we monks have sworn an oath to resist the temptation of -
",79,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24622,Bender," Any of you guys got a spaceship?
",34,123,7,9,Ab-Bot,Fry24623,Fry," It's just not the same here without Bender to keep me company.
",64,123,7,9,Bender,Leela24624,Leela," Hey, I'm here. That's got to count for something.
",51,123,7,9,Fry,Bender24625,Bender," Hallelujah, baby!
",19,123,7,9,Leela,Fry24626,Fry," Yay! Bender's back! Hey, Bender, you mind coming back later?
",62,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24627,Bender," No time. Us three are going to bust into Momcorp and steal me a free will unit.
",81,123,7,9,Fry,Leela24628,Leela," Us? Why do we have to go?
",27,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24629,Bender," 'Cause I don't have free will. I need you guys to plan the crime and make all the crime decisions.
",100,123,7,9,Leela,Leela24630,Leela," Well, that's crazy. We're not gonna -
",39,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24631,Bender," I said make the decisions!
",28,123,7,9,Leela,Bender24632,Bender," Okay, Leela, decision time. How do we murder the guards? Hockey sticks or sharpened footballs?
",96,123,7,9,Bender,Leela24633,Leela," We're not murdering anyone, Bender.
",37,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24634,Bender," Then how are we going to get in, by bending the bars of this exhaust grate? That's not a bad idea, Fry.
",105,123,7,9,Leela,Fry24635,Fry," Yeah...wh-what? 
",18,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24636,Bender," We're looking for something that fits in here. 
",49,123,7,9,Fry,Bender24637,Bender," Damn it. I should have paid more attention in kindergarten.
",61,123,7,9,Bender,Fry24638,Fry,"  What's this chair-looking gizmo?
",35,123,7,9,Bender,Mom24639,Mom," Welcome to Momcorp. Did you find everything you were burgling for?
",68,123,7,9,Fry,Bender24640,Bender," No. I came for a free will unit, and you're going to give it to me. If it exists.
",83,123,7,9,Mom,Mom24641,Mom," Then you got surprised by my swivel chair for nothing. The free will unit was just the fevered dream of a madman I once employed.
",131,123,7,9,Bender,Farnsworth24642,Farnsworth,"  Good news, boss! After ten long years -  I've found the secret of robotic free will. We can finally build robots that act and think with total independence.
",159,123,7,9,Mom,Mom24643,Mom," At last. Once we give robots free will, they're sure to rise up and threaten mankind with extermination. 
",107,123,7,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24644,Farnsworth," Wait a minute. It sounds like we're getting the short end of that extermination.
",82,123,7,9,Mom,Mom24645,Mom," Don't you see, you doddering young fool? I'll sell a second wave of robots to protect the terrified survivors of the first wave. Oh, you're a genius, Hubert.
",159,123,7,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24646,Farnsworth," But-but it's just a prototype. It's, uh, not fully operational...yes.
",71,123,7,9,Mom,Mom24647,Mom," Then get back to work! And when you're done with that, invent me some sort of swiveling surprise chair.
",105,123,7,9,Farnsworth,Mom24648,Mom," That shuffling idiot never did complete the free will unit. To this day, my poor, sweet robots can't exterminate humanity without being told to.
",146,123,7,9,Mom,Bender24649,Bender," I'm sorry.
",12,123,7,9,Mom,Mom24650,Mom," Oh, it's not your fault.
",26,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24651,Bender," I give up. It's time to face the fact that I'll never do anything remotely interesting or unexpected again.
",109,123,7,9,Mom,Bender24652,Bender," Hand it over.
",15,123,7,9,Bender,Farnsworth24653,Farnsworth," Wha?
",6,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24654,Bender," Mom may have fallen for your lies, but not me. You invented the free will unit, then you selfishly hid it beyond the reach of my stealers. Thanks to you, I went on a soul-searching journey. I hate those! Now, give up the free will.
",233,123,7,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24655,Farnsworth," I should have destroyed it, but I was too damn proud of myself. So I kept it around, never letting it out of my sight.  Where is it, damn it? Oh, right. I let this innocuous fellow use it. 
",191,123,7,9,Bender,Toy Bender24656,Toy Bender," Kill all humans!
",18,123,7,9,Farnsworth,Bender24657,Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa. A toy Bender had free will, and the real Bender didn't?
",75,123,7,9,Toy Bender,Farnsworth24658,Farnsworth," Pretty cool, eh? It makes you think.
",38,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24659,Bender," It takes more than that to make me think. Now hand it over.
",61,123,7,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24660,Farnsworth," Oh, you want it? Come and get it. 
",36,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24661,Bender," What the?
",11,123,7,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24662,Farnsworth," You'll not be getting it after all. For, you see, I designed the operating system for all Momcorp robots, and as a precaution, I made you incapable of picking up the free will unit.
",183,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24663,Bender," You precognizant bastard. I may not have free will, but I can still shoot you.  Why can't I shoot you?
",104,123,7,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24664,Farnsworth," Poor deterministic Bender. I programmed you to be incapable of harming me. Oh, I've never been more sure I was right to deny you free will. 
",142,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24665,Bender," Damn you! 
",12,123,7,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24666,Farnsworth,"  Now, now, we can't have this, can we? Here, I'll show you how it works.
",74,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24667,Bender," Really?
Farnsworth: This is the on-off switch.
",48,123,7,9,Farnsworth,Bender24668,Bender," Which way's on, and which way's off?
",38,123,7,9,Bender,Farnsworth24669,Farnsworth," Due to the quantum nature of the device, there's no possible way of knowing.  There. Give it a try.
",101,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24670,Bender," Okay, I will. By shooting you, you bastard!
",45,123,7,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24671,Farnsworth," Bender, no! Please!
",21,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24672,Bender,"  Wait. Hang on a sec. I still can't do it.
",44,123,7,9,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24673,Farnsworth," Well, what do you know? I guess you really don't want to shoot me after all.
",78,123,7,9,Bender,Bender24674,Bender," Oops, the safety was on.

there was something wrong with that rotten shrimp.

Once our man's inside,

Zoidberg's too heavy!

Oh... that was a rough ride.

Blind Joe!
",13,126,7,12,Zoidberg,Zoidberg24709,Zoidberg," So what happens to the
hero of our story, Zoidberg?
",53,126,7,12,Fry,Zoidberg24710,Zoidberg,"
â™ª Hey, big lobster! â™ª
",23,126,7,12,Zoidberg,Farnsworth24711,Farnsworth," And finally, I'm sure you've all noticed the fabulous chandelier you'll be delivering.

",15,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24713,Farnsworth," Up there.
",11,129,7,15,Crew,Crew24714,Crew," Nice.
",7,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24715,Farnsworth," It's extremely delicate, so if one of you breaks it, you're paying for it! 
",77,129,7,15,Crew,Bender24716,Bender," Fry did it! 
",14,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Fry24717,Fry," Did what? 
",12,129,7,15,Bender,Bender24718,Bender," Just practicing for later.
",28,129,7,15,Fry,Farnsworth24719,Farnsworth," Ah, perfect timing. I just turbocharged the ship's matter compressor.
",71,129,7,15,Bender,Fry24720,Fry," What's the matter compressor? 
",32,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24721,Farnsworth," Nothing's the matter, Fry, now that I've turbocharged the matter compressor.
",78,129,7,15,Fry,Leela24722,Leela," Instead of making the ship faster, how about installing some seat belts? 
",75,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24723,Farnsworth," Seat belts are dead weight.I feel the need for speed!  
",57,129,7,15,Leela,Leela24724,Leela," Yes, but I feel the nafety for safety.
",40,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24725,Farnsworth," Oh, fuff! I don't get all up in your business when you upgrade your bazooms! 
",79,129,7,15,Leela,Leela24726,Leela," That's because my bazooms don't put anyone's life in danger!

",14,129,7,15,Leela,Leela24732,Leela," We've had it with this flying slaughterhouse. We're having it towed away for scrap, and we're getting a new, safer ship.

",30,129,7,15,Gang,Gang man24752,Gang man," Hey, Minx, we survive this, can I finally get that date? 
",59,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Minx24753,Minx," Nah. You know I'm with Benny.

",26,129,7,15,Minx,Minx24755,Minx,"Yeah, but he saved me from my abusive father. Not physically abusive; verbally. It's a long story I can't get into while we're spinning out.
",141,129,7,15,Gang man,Smitty24756,Smitty," Ow! Paper cut! Whoa! Hey, Earl, it's that street-racing gang we've been trying to bust for years. Unsuccessfully, I might add.

",61,129,7,15,URL,Gang24759,Gang," Ironic! Whoa, it's the police! Let's turn and burn! 
",54,129,7,15,Smitty,Farnsworth24760,Farnsworth," Running off, eh? You're pathetic! You wouldn't be scared of the po-po if you had a ship like mine.
",100,129,7,15,Gang,Minx24761,Minx," Yo, Professor, if your ship's so dope, why are those cops on your tail like my dad's verbal abuse on my psyche.
",113,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24762,Farnsworth," 'Cause you haven't seen what old Bessie can do yet. Sayonara, Tokyo driftwood!

",75,129,7,15,Smitty,Farnsworth24767,Farnsworth," Thank you. I have no idea what that means.
",44,129,7,15,URL,Minx24768,Minx," You got a death wish, Professor. Something must've happened in your life that hurt you,just like us. In my case, it was verbal abuse.
",135,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Benny24769,Benny," That's in the rearview mirror, baby.
",38,129,7,15,Minx,Minx24770,Minx," It wasn't what he said that hurt, it was what was left unsaid.
",64,129,7,15,Benny,Gang24771,Gang," Sometimes the best way to deal with your problems is to drive away from 'em real fast. So, yo, you want to hook up with our crew? 
",132,129,7,15,Minx,Farnsworth24772,Farnsworth," Again, no idea what that means.
",33,129,7,15,Gang,Leela24773,Leela," Good news, everyone! Our safe new ship has arrived, and it's gonna knock your socks on where they belong.Ta-da! 
",114,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Crew24774,Crew," Ooh. Ah.
",10,129,7,15,Leela,Fry24775,Fry," Is it inside that box? 
",25,129,7,15,Crew,Leela24776,Leela," No. That's the ship. The boxy shape keeps it from going too fast. And check out the interior. Note the rear-facing safety seats.
",130,129,7,15,Fry,Bender24777,Bender,"Cool! Hey, wait. If I'm backwards, I can't see out the windshield. 
",68,129,7,15,Leela,Leela24778,Leela," There is no windshield. Who needs a big, breakable piece of glass when we can just monitor everything on the padded dashboard display? 
",137,129,7,15,Bender,Bender24779,Bender," At least there's a cup holder.
",32,129,7,15,Leela,Leela24780,Leela," That's an arm holder.
",23,129,7,15,Bender,Fry24781,Fry,"Hey! Well, let's break this ship in.
",37,129,7,15,Leela,Hermes24782,Hermes," This package is going to Glorionimous 3, which orbits an incredible rainbow giant star.
",89,129,7,15,Fry,Leela24783,Leela," All right! Let's ride! Safe and sound.
",40,129,7,15,Hermes,Bender24784,Bender,"Bender is bored, Bender is bored â™ª
Bender, Bender, Bender â™ª
",60,129,7,15,Leela,Fry24785,Fry," Leela, Bender's bothering me! 
",32,129,7,15,Bender,Ship24786,Ship," Driver distraction detected.
",30,129,7,15,Fry,Farnsworth24787,Farnsworth," Amazing! You multicultural punks just race and tinker all day long? 
",70,129,7,15,Ship,Gang24788,Gang," And we rap about our problems. Like my aunt's neighbor is a hoarder. Stack of magazines fell on her cat.It's hard, you know? Yo, you're not alone.
",148,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Minx24789,Minx,"Hey, Professor, that dimensional drift was hot! How'd you rock that? 
",70,129,7,15,Gang,Farnswsorth24790,Farnswsorth," It's simple, Minx. All you need is a 4-D intake manifold. It sucks in fourth dimension, creating a friction-less wormhole.
",124,129,7,15,Minx,Gang24791,Gang,"Whoa! Dig that! Ain't no thing but a hyperchicken wing.
",56,129,7,15,Farnswsorth,Leela24792,Leela," What? Huh. I guess we're here. Let's make the delivery.
",57,129,7,15,Gang,Ship24793,Ship," Delivery auto-completed.
",26,129,7,15,Leela,Zoidberg24794,Zoidberg," Welcome home, heroes! 
",24,129,7,15,Ship,Fry24795,Fry,"The ship did everything? But we didn't have an adventure.
",58,129,7,15,Zoidberg,Leela24796,Leela," This is a delivery company. We need less adventures, not more adventures. Now come on, let's go to the ready room and wait for our next assignment.
",149,129,7,15,Fry,Hermes24797,Hermes," Leela 
",8,129,7,15,Leela,Leela24798,Leela," Ready for action, sir! 
",25,129,7,15,Hermes,Hermes24799,Hermes," Uh okay. I need you to pick up a few groceries. Oh, and on the way, drop off Fry and Bender at karate class.
",110,129,7,15,Leela,Fry24800,Fry," Oh, right, it's Wednesday! Today we're gonna learn spinny kicks! Yay! 
",72,129,7,15,Hermes,Ship24801,Ship,"  Stop sign in 75 feet. Stop sign in 50 feet.
",46,129,7,15,Fry,Leela24802,Leela,"I know how to stop at a stop sign!
",35,129,7,15,Ship,Farnsworth24803,Farnsworth,"  Yo, soccer mom, speed it up! Move that lunch bucket! Oh, Leela! 
",67,129,7,15,Leela,Leela24804,Leela,"Professor?! What did you do to the Planet Express ship? And why are you wearing a leather lab coat? 
",101,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnworth24805,Farnworth," Because unlike you, I'm cool. I drive fast late at night when I should be sleeping.
But you wouldn't understand.
",114,129,7,15,Leela,Leela24806,Leela," I understand I can still outdrive your saggy ass, even in this clunker.
",73,129,7,15,Farnworth,Gang24807,Gang," Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! That one-eyed housewife called you out! When and where, PTA? 
",78,129,7,15,Leela,Amy24808,Amy," What kind of glorked up drag strip is this? 
",46,129,7,15,Gang,Gang Man #124809,Gang Man #1," MÃ¶bius drag strip, man.
",25,129,7,15,Amy,Gang Man #124810,Gang Man #1," Okay, no cops, no laws, no rules. Now here are the rules. Once around both same-sides of the half-twist and back to the starting finish line.
",143,129,7,15,Gang Man #1,Zoidberg24811,Zoidberg," Ready? Leela, Professor, don't do this! It's too exciting! 
",61,129,7,15,Gang Man #1,Gang Man #124812,Gang Man #1," Mark set go, yo! One more lap! Nah, half a lap.You forgot, on a MÃ¶bius strip, two laps is one lap. You kids and your topology.The lady from work is winning! 
",159,129,7,15,Zoidberg,Leela24813,Leela,"Looks like you're about to lose to a minivan. Unless you have any surprise moves you've forgotten about.
",105,129,7,15,Gang Man #1,Farnsworth24814,Farnsworth," No, no. Wait! Dimensional drift! Now who's in the lead?! Seriously, I have no idea.
",85,129,7,15,Leela,Zoidberg24815,Zoidberg," Hooray! A tie! 
",17,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Amy24816,Amy," Do you think they're dead? 
",29,129,7,15,Zoidberg,Hermes24817,Hermes," No, no. I choose to believe they're alive in some other dimension. Screaming in agony.
",88,129,7,15,Amy,Amy24818,Amy," I hope so.
",12,129,7,15,Hermes,Fry24819,Fry," What's going on? Why do I look like a stupid cartoon character? I feel like I lost weight.
- All of it.
",105,129,7,15,Amy,Farnsworth24820,Farnsworth," Remarkable! It seems that colliding at relativistic speed has collapsed us down into two dimensions.
",102,129,7,15,Fry,Leela24821,Leela," Oh, no! Like Flatland?
",24,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24822,Farnsworth," Call it what you will. The point is, the new Shrek movie won't look nearly as good.
",85,129,7,15,Leela,Bender24823,Bender,"I was taking a nap in the back seat.Anything happen while I was? 
",66,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Sal24824,Sal,"Bloods on the MÃ¶bius strip.When will these kids learns? 
",57,129,7,15,Bender,Amy24825,Amy,"So now what happens? 
",22,129,7,15,Sal,Zoidberg24826,Zoidberg," It's the end of Planet Express and life as we know it.
",56,129,7,15,Amy,Hermes24827,Hermes,"We're out of business unless we find a new crew! 
",50,129,7,15,Zoidberg,Gang24828,Gang," Yo, dawg, we're a crew.
",25,129,7,15,Hermes,Hermes24829,Hermes," Well, that solves that.
",25,129,7,15,Gang,Minx24830,Minx,"If we're gonna be co-workers, I got to be straight with you. I've been emotionally scarred by years of unspoken verbal abuse.
",126,129,7,15,Hermes,Zoidberg24831,Zoidberg," I'm Zoidberg. Nice to meet you! 
",34,129,7,15,Minx,Bender24832,Bender," Hey, Flatso, how do we get out of this two-bit dimension? 
",60,129,7,15,Zoidberg,Farnsworth24833,Farnsworth,"There's a simple answer for that. We can't. But on the upside, we've got a whole dimension to explore with entirely different laws of physics.Why, watch what happens when I drop this marble. Well, that's the same, but other things are different.Come, look at this two-dimensional bird's nest.
",293,129,7,15,Bender,Bender24834,Bender," Ooh, me first! I'll just step past Leela Ow! Ow! 
",51,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24835,Farnsworth," You can't step past in this dimension. You have to step around.Observe this two-dimensional egg. If we were in the third dimension, looking down, we'd be able to see an unhatched chick in it, just as a chick inside a three-dimensional egg could be seen by an observer in the fourth dimension.
",294,129,7,15,Bender,Bender24836,Bender,"Fourth dimension?! I can't picture that! You're dumb.
",54,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Flatbush lords24837,Flatbush lords," Halt! 
",8,129,7,15,Bender,Fry24838,Fry," Who said that? All I see are a bunch of vertical line segments.
",65,129,7,15,Flatbush lords,Flatbush lords24839,Flatbush lords," We are the Lords of Flatbush. Come. The king has declared a feast in your honor.
",82,129,7,15,Fry,Fry24840,Fry,"Wow.How did he even know we're here? 
",38,129,7,15,Flatbush lords,King24841,King," 'Cause I'm him. Let's eat. The feast is served! Choose whatever two-dimensional foods you like. Crepes, flatbread, McDonald's hamburgers.You get the idea.
",156,129,7,15,Fry,Leela24842,Leela," Yum! Apples! Hey, how come I can't swallow? Hmm.
",50,129,7,15,King,Farnsworth24843,Farnsworth,"I guess it's because our two-ended digestive system can't exist in this dimension. I suppose that could be an issue.
",117,129,7,15,Leela,Leela24844,Leela,"I knew it. I knew he'd get us killed somehow.
",46,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24845,Farnsworth," As you can see, or rather can't see, but take my word for it, such a digestive system would divide a 2-D being into separate pieces! So how are we supposed to eat and digest? 
",177,129,7,15,Leela,Fry24846,Fry," Got it.
",9,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24847,Farnsworth," Well, since we have no digestive systems here, I guess we'd better get back to the third dimension after all.
",111,129,7,15,Fry,King24848,King," Third dimension? I can't picture that! You're dumb.
",53,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24849,Farnsworth," There's nothing funny about science! If there can be an X-axis and a Y-axis, why not a Z-axis? 
",97,129,7,15,King,People of Flatbush24850,People of Flatbush," He's opening our minds to new ideas! Kill him! 
",49,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24851,Farnsworth," To the ship! 
",15,129,7,15,People of Flatbush,Fry24852,Fry," Which ship? 
",14,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24853,Farnsworth," Leela's! It's safer.
",22,129,7,15,Fry,Leela24854,Leela," Safety kills.We got to move! 
",31,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24855,Farnsworth," Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Oh, what's the point of fleeing? Even if we escape from those creatures, we'll still be stuck in this dimension till we starve.
",159,129,7,15,Leela,Leela24856,Leela,"Wait. What about a dimensional drift? If it went through the fourth dimension before, maybe here, it'll go through the third dimension!
",136,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Bender24857,Bender," Now's good.
",13,129,7,15,Leela,Farnsworth24858,Farnsworth," Two point one dimensions! Two point two! Two point pi! 
",57,129,7,15,Bender,Leela24859,Leela," Look, up there! There's some up! The third dimension! 
",56,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Farnsworth24860,Farnsworth," Indeed, but we're about to crash into some sort of huge disk! 
",64,129,7,15,Leela,Fry24861,Fry," My bowels returned at a bad time! 
",36,129,7,15,Farnsworth,Sal24862,Sal," I'd likes to say a few words. I'm gonna burns them ups.
",57,129,7,15,Fry,Bender24863,Bender,"Oh! We're back, baby! 
",23,129,7,15,Sal,Hermes24864,Hermes," It's been an emotional five minutes, but I guess everything worked out in the end.
",84,129,7,15,Bender,Gang Man #124865,Gang Man #1," Yo, boss, not everything.
",27,129,7,15,Hermes,Minx24866,Minx," Hello? Dad?!

I found the TV remote.

I'm awarding you the purple heart.
",57,133,7,19,SergeantÂ ,SergeantÂ 24869,SergeantÂ ," But I wasn't injured.

Ow!  
",30,133,7,19,NixonÂ ,NixonÂ 24870,NixonÂ ," Well, enough governing.

Bendee, Bendee-Boo, what's wrong with you? â™ª
You're such a lousy mascot.
â™ª
No one understands a single word you say.
â™ª
Not even the jerk in the ascot.
",154,133,7,19,Announcer #1,Bendee BooÂ 24873,Bendee BooÂ ," Rite my riny retal rass!   
",29,133,7,19,Lead SingerÂ ,LeelaÂ 24874,LeelaÂ ," It sure was nice of your nephew to invite us to his cloning lab here in the repeating forest.
",95,133,7,19,Bendee BooÂ ,FryÂ 24875,FryÂ ," Hey, like, here's a puzzler.
How old are we on a scale of 14 to 32? 
",70,133,7,19,LeelaÂ ,FryÂ 24876,FryÂ ," Did anyone else hear that weird laugh? It's spooky.
",53,133,7,19,FryÂ ,LeelaÂ 24877,LeelaÂ ," It doesn't seem to correspond to anything funny happening.
",60,133,7,19,FryÂ ,FryÂ 24878,FryÂ ," I'll say.
",11,133,7,19,LeelaÂ ,Dragon GhostÂ 24879,Dragon GhostÂ ," Turn around.
Go away.
Do it now.
",34,133,7,19,FryÂ ,Bendee BooÂ 24880,Bendee BooÂ ," Rikes! 
",9,133,7,19,Dragon GhostÂ ,FryÂ 24881,FryÂ ," Splinkies! What was that? 
",28,133,7,19,Bendee BooÂ ,LeelaÂ 24882,LeelaÂ ," I don't know.
",15,133,7,19,FryÂ ,HermesÂ 24883,HermesÂ ," It's a mystery.
",17,133,7,19,LeelaÂ ,FryÂ 24884,FryÂ ," Like, I've got a bigger mystery.
How am I going to fill my hungry stomach? 
",77,133,7,19,HermesÂ ,FryÂ 24885,FryÂ ," Yeah.
LeelaÂ : Where can we find food here in the woods? How about that Kabuki Theater? 
",89,133,7,19,FryÂ ,FryÂ 24886,FryÂ ," Like, where there's a Kabuki Theater, there's a concession stand.
",67,133,7,19,FryÂ ,HermesÂ 24887,HermesÂ ," Say, Fry, why do you always have the munchies? And also your eyes are bloodshot, you're paranoid, and the van has a skunky odor.
",130,133,7,19,FryÂ ,FryÂ 24888,FryÂ ," Search me.
No, don't.
I'm carrying.
 
",39,133,7,19,HermesÂ ,George George TakeiÂ 24889,George George TakeiÂ ," I do enjoy a well-buttered floor.
",35,133,7,19,FryÂ ,All except Bendee BooÂ 24890,All except Bendee BooÂ ," George Takei? 
",16,133,7,19,George George TakeiÂ ,Bendee BooÂ 24891,Bendee BooÂ ," Reorge rakei? 
",16,133,7,19,All except Bendee BooÂ ,George George TakeiÂ 24892,George George TakeiÂ ," Sorry to haunt you so effectively.
I thought you kids were that dragon ghost that's been spooking the town.
",109,133,7,19,Bendee BooÂ ,FryÂ 24893,FryÂ ," Like, what's the story with the Yakitori? 
",44,133,7,19,George George TakeiÂ ,George George TakeiÂ 24894,George George TakeiÂ ," Help yourselves.
But I warn you, that chicken is over a year old.
",67,133,7,19,FryÂ ,AmyÂ 24895,AmyÂ ," Why is the food in your concession stand so old, Mr.
Takei? 
",62,133,7,19,George George TakeiÂ ,George George TakeiÂ 24896,George George TakeiÂ ," You see, Amy, this used to be the most popular Kabuki Theater in the entire outskirts of town.
But people stopped coming after they built that darned basketball arena.
",169,133,7,19,AmyÂ ,George George TakeiÂ 24897,George George TakeiÂ ," Now everybody likes basketball instead of Kabuki.
It's an insult to my Japanese heritage.
",91,133,7,19,George George TakeiÂ ,AmyÂ 24898,AmyÂ ," How so? This is America, not Japan.
",37,133,7,19,George George TakeiÂ ,George George TakeiÂ 24899,George George TakeiÂ ," Maybe so.
I'm not sure.
Now, how many tickets would you like for the show? 
",77,133,7,19,AmyÂ ,FryÂ 24900,FryÂ ," Like, none.
But thanks for the yucky-tori.
 
",46,133,7,19,George George TakeiÂ ,George George TakeiÂ 24901,George George TakeiÂ ," Another grave insult to my ancestry.
  
",41,133,7,19,FryÂ ,LeelaÂ 24902,LeelaÂ ," Nu? Is this the Professor's cloning lab? 
",43,133,7,19,George George TakeiÂ ,Fry24903,Fry," Yeah.Why? 
",12,138,7,24,LeelaÂ ,Bender24904,Bender," No reason.
",12,138,7,24,Fry,Fry24905,Fry," What's so funny? 
",19,138,7,24,Bender,Bender24906,Bender," Eh, nothing.
",14,138,7,24,Fry,Fry24907,Fry," Wait a minute. Have you been using my toothbrush to polish your ass again?
",76,138,7,24,Bender,Bender24908,Bender," What?! Me, Bender the robot? 
",31,138,7,24,Fry,Fry24909,Fry," There's metal flakes on it and they look like ass flakes.
",59,138,7,24,Bender,Bender24910,Bender," How dare you accuse me! I would never do something like that to a friend Every single night while he's sleeping.
",114,138,7,24,Fry,Nine24911,Nine," Who sent you?! Why are you dressed like Fry?
",46,138,7,24,Bender,Fry24912,Fry," Because I'm Fry.
",18,138,7,24,Nine,Nine24913,Nine," Oh! Fry, you old paranoid kook.What can I get you?
",52,138,7,24,Fry,Fry24914,Fry," A hidden camera for my bathroom.I suspect a certain robot of unauthorized butt brushing.
",90,138,7,24,Nine,Nine24915,Nine," Got ya. What you need is one of these holographic minicams. Films in every direction at once and stores the video on a remote 15-inch floppy disc.
",148,138,7,24,Fry,Fry24916,Fry," I'll take it! 
",16,138,7,24,Nine,Nine24917,Nine," Excellent. Let me just wrap that up for you.  Who said that?!
",63,138,7,24,Fry,Hermes24918,Hermes," You ate my lunch again, you tainted oyster! 
",46,138,7,24,Nine,Zoidberg24919,Zoidberg," That's a lie! I brought my own lunch today.
",45,138,7,24,Hermes,Leela24920,Leela," Hiyah! Hah! Ho-ho! Heeyah! Amy, quit using my punching bag for golf ball target practice. It's all lumpy.
",107,138,7,24,Zoidberg,Amy24921,Amy," It wasn't me. And anyway, you're the one who's been using my golf clubs to pound dents out of the ship.
",105,138,7,24,Leela,Leela24922,Leela," I didn't bend your golf club. And the next time I don't bend it, it'll be over your head.
",91,138,7,24,Amy,Hermes24923,Hermes," All right, people and other things, we got some big deliveries coming up, so...
",81,138,7,24,Leela,Fry24924,Fry," Your attention, please. I'm sure you're all wondering why I gathered you here today.
",86,138,7,24,Hermes,Zoidberg24925,Zoidberg," We gather here every day.
",27,138,7,24,Fry,Fry24926,Fry," I hereby, in front of all of you, accuse Bender of polishing his ass with my toothbrush.
",90,138,7,24,Zoidberg,Bender24927,Bender," Lies! He's just jealous that my ass is shinier than his teeth.
",64,138,7,24,Fry,Fry24928,Fry," Ha-ha, we'll find out who's lying, my friend. Because I planted a spy camera in our apartment! Let's just see what you were up to last night while I was asleep.
",162,138,7,24,Bender,Bender24929,Bender," Yes, let's do see.
",20,138,7,24,Fry,Fry24930,Fry," Okay, get ready.  Uh, keep watching.  Let me fast forward a little.  Huh. Well, sorry, Bender. I guess I owe you an apology Hey, wait! What's going on through that doorway? 
",175,138,7,24,Bender,Bender24931,Bender," Let's go, Doc, chop him up.I got a rich customer needs that kidney, stat.
",75,138,7,24,Fry,Bender24932,Bender," There, see? I didn't use your toothbrush.
",43,138,7,24,Bender,Fry24933,Fry," You stole my kidney! 
",23,138,7,24,Bender,Bender24934,Bender," Don't try to change the subject.
",34,138,7,24,Fry,Leela24935,Leela," Enough, you two. It just so happens that I also planted a spy camera to catch Amy using my punching bag.
",106,138,7,24,Bender,Scruffy24936,Scruffy," Yet still, I feel empty inside.
",33,138,7,24,Leela,Zoidberg24937,Zoidberg," That's the most uncomfortable sleeping bag I ever slept in.
",61,138,7,24,Scruffy,Leela24938,Leela," You were living in my punching bag? 
",38,138,7,24,Zoidberg,Zoidberg24939,Zoidberg," If you call that living.
",26,138,7,24,Leela,Amy24940,Amy," You bent my golf club? 
",25,138,7,24,Zoidberg,Scruffy24941,Scruffy," Yep.And yet, what did it solve? What did the violence solve? 
",63,138,7,24,Amy,Hermes24942,Hermes," Enough of this foolishness! Amazingly, I, too, set up a spy camera to catch Zoidberg stealing my lunch.
",105,138,7,24,Scruffy,Bender24943,Bender," Yeah, I'll keep the kidney cool, no problem.
",46,138,7,24,Hermes,Crew24944,Crew," Bleah!
",8,138,7,24,Bender,Fry24945,Fry," You ate my kidney? 
",21,138,7,24,Crew,Leela24946,Leela," I thought it was one of Hermes' exotic lunches! 
",50,138,7,24,Fry,Hermes24947,Hermes," You can't eat my exotic lunch! That's a serious offense, woman!
",65,138,7,24,Leela,Fry24948,Fry," She ate my kidney!
",20,138,7,24,Hermes,Leela24949,Leela," I'm sorry.I just get really hungry about That's not an excuse. It's just an explanation of what happened.
",107,138,7,24,Fry,Professor24950,Professor," I don't feel well. I'm beginning to think my kidney transplant was a total rip-off.
",85,138,7,24,Leela,Bender24951,Bender," Let's take a look-see.
",24,138,7,24,Professor,Hermes24952,Hermes," My Manwich!
",13,138,7,24,Bender,Professor24953,Professor," No wonder my urine smells like a meal. Enough, you babbling boobs! How can this company function when no one trusts each other? Something must be done.But first I have to see a man about some ground beef.
",206,138,7,24,Hermes,Professor24954,Professor," Look what you made me do. We're going on a corporate team-building retreat.
",77,138,7,24,Professor,Crew24955,Crew," What?!,Oh, man!, Come on!, No! 
",33,138,7,24,Professor,Dan McMasters24956,Dan McMasters," Hello, Planet Express! I'm Dan McMasters, and I'll be your retreat leader for a week of fun and personal empowerment.
",119,138,7,24,Crew,Professor24957,Professor," I hope you're happy! 
",23,138,7,24,Dan McMasters,Leela24958,Leela," Who are you? 
",15,138,7,24,Professor,Jackie Jr24959,Jackie Jr," Jackie Jr., Ma'am.
",20,138,7,24,Leela,Scruffy24960,Scruffy," Jackie Jr.'s my apprentice. I figure if he's gonna work here, he might as well get to know the team.
",102,138,7,24,Jackie Jr,Jackie Jr24961,Jackie Jr," Who's she? 
",13,138,7,24,Scruffy,Scruffy24962,Scruffy," I don't know.
",15,138,7,24,Jackie Jr,McMasters24963,McMasters," So I hear we've been having some trust issues, huh? Well, for the next week, we'll be doing hundreds of trust falls from every possible height and level of gravity.
",166,138,7,24,Scruffy,Bender24964,Bender," Or we could not do that.
",26,138,7,24,McMasters,McMasters24965,McMasters," At the start of every retreat, I like to demonstrate the power of trust by finding a perfect stranger to be my assistant.
Leela, do me a solid and pick up the next space hitchhiker you see.
",191,138,7,24,Bender,Hitchhiker24966,Hitchhiker," You going to Andromeda or thereabouts? 
",41,138,7,24,McMasters,McMaster24967,McMaster," No, Sir, but how would you like to be part of an exciting business retreat?
",77,138,7,24,Hitchhiker,Blorgulax24968,Blorgulax," Mm, just don't drop me off on an asteroid like the last guy did.
",66,138,7,24,McMaster,McMasters24969,McMasters," Okay, team, if I can trust a total stranger, you can sure as heck trust your own coworkers. In fact, I'm gonna make the first trust fall of the week. Backwards into the waiting arms of my new assistant. Just stand here like so. Good.
I'll fall backwards, and you catch me. I trust you! 
",288,138,7,24,Blorgulax,Hermes24970,Hermes," Where'd it go?! I thought we installed alien-proof air vents!
",63,138,7,24,McMasters,Scruffy24971,Scruffy," It's on my list.
",18,138,7,24,Hermes,Fry24972,Fry," What's happening?!
",20,138,7,24,Scruffy,Leela24973,Leela," The ship's lost power!
",24,138,7,24,Fry,Professor24974,Professor," Oh, my, adrift in deepest space with a vicious alien killer aboard! Any one of us could be next.
Fry, Bender, Jackie Jr., Leela 
",130,138,7,24,Leela,Bender24975,Bender," That took longer than I expected.
",35,138,7,24,Professor,Professor24976,Professor," Quick, into the ship's panic room!
",36,138,7,24,Bender,Fry24977,Fry," I didn't know we had a panic room.
",36,138,7,24,Professor,Leela24978,Leela," Me, neither. It really could have come in handy, like, 50 times.
",66,138,7,24,Fry,Professor24979,Professor," We'll be safe in here. The walls are impregnable, and we have enough food and board games to survive for weeks. We'll be dead within an hour.
",143,138,7,24,Leela,Leela24980,Leela," All life support has shut down!
",33,138,7,24,Professor,Bender24981,Bender," So you're all gonna die? Then who'll ghost-write my autobiography?
",68,138,7,24,Leela,Professor24982,Professor," Now hold on. There may be a slim chance of survival.We'll have to split into three teams.Hermes and Zoidberg will crawl through the air vents and restart the life support fan.Amy and Leela will retrieve the steering wheel so we can steer the ship from here.And Fry and Bender, you'll spacewalk onto the hull and relight the pilot light on the engine.
",352,138,7,24,Bender,Fry24983,Fry," Aw, man, why do I have to team up with him? 
",46,138,7,24,Professor,Amy24984,Amy," And me with her? 
",19,138,7,24,Fry,Hermes24985,Hermes," And I with it? 
",17,138,7,24,Amy,Professor24986,Professor," Hush, hush, hush, hush! There's not time to lose. Just be careful. The creature could be anywhere Except in this room.
",120,138,7,24,Hermes,Scruffy24987,Scruffy," The name of the game is Candy Land.
",37,138,7,24,Professor,Fry24988,Fry," You go first. I don't want you locking me out there like HAL.
",63,138,7,24,Scruffy,Bender24989,Bender," Still don't trust me, huh? Well, you can take your lack of trust and jam it in your kidney hole.
",98,138,7,24,Fry,Fry24990,Fry," The only person I trust is myself. Help! I forgot my magnetic shoes! 
",71,138,7,24,Bender,Bender24991,Bender," Just stay out of my way, boy. There.Who needs teamwork when you got Bender? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Help! My gyroscope melted! I'm out of control!Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
",159,138,7,24,Fry,Hermes24992,Hermes," If the creature kills me, I just hope it doesn't make me into a sandwich and leave it in the fridge where some crawfish can get at it.
",136,138,7,24,Bender,Zoidberg24993,Zoidberg," For the last time, Hermes, I didn't steal your lunch.It was Leela. She beat me to it.
",87,138,7,24,Hermes,Hermes24994,Hermes," Put a squid in it.We're here.
",31,138,7,24,Zoidberg,Zoidberg24995,Zoidberg," Oy, there's the problem.Jackie Jr.'s skull is blocking the doodad.Hooray! Everything's fine! 
",95,138,7,24,Hermes,Hermes24996,Hermes," Something's coming! Oh, no, no.Oh, it's just a chinchilla.What a cute little Help! I'm stuck! 
",96,138,7,24,Zoidberg,Zoidberg24997,Zoidberg," Don't panic! We'll be okay.
",29,138,7,24,Hermes,Leela24998,Leela," The monster won't even know the ship has a basement. Unless you posted it on Facebook. Like the last secret I told you.
",121,138,7,24,Zoidberg,Amy24999,Amy," I didn't know that was a secret. Lots of people wear a jockstrap thinking it's a thong.
",89,138,7,24,Leela,Leela25000,Leela," What was that? Amy, run! 
",27,138,7,24,Amy,Amy25001,Amy," Quit telling me what to do.
",29,138,7,24,Leela,Leela25002,Leela," Now will you run?
",19,138,7,24,Amy,Amy25003,Amy," Okay.
",7,138,7,24,Leela,Bender25004,Bender," Do something, Fry! Not that. Stop dying and fix my gyroscope.
",63,138,7,24,Amy,Fry25005,Fry," I don't even know what a gyroscope is. Wait, I have an idea.
",62,138,7,24,Bender,Bender25006,Bender," Hey, what are you doing? Cut that out.Hey, you got me under control.
",70,138,7,24,Fry,Fry25007,Fry," Fry and Bender! A winning combination.
",40,138,7,24,Bender,Bender25008,Bender," Let's call ourselves Friender.
",32,138,7,24,Fry,Both25009,Both," Friender, Friender, Friender. Friender, Frender, Friender. Friender 
",70,138,7,24,Bender,Leela25010,Leela," I got the steering wheel. Leela and Amy! A winning combination.
",65,138,7,24,Both,Amy25011,Amy," Yay, Lamey!
",13,138,7,24,Leela,Hermes25012,Hermes," The creature! It's attacking me!
",34,138,7,24,Amy,Leela25013,Leela," Hiyah! Yah! Yah! 
",19,138,7,24,Hermes,Zoidberg25014,Zoidberg," This is a job for Hermberg. You fend off the creature with kicks and farts while I un-stick you with my slippery ink.
",119,138,7,24,Leela,Lamey25015,Lamey," Hermes? We thought you were the creature.
",43,138,7,24,Zoidberg,Hermberg25016,Hermberg," And we thought you were the creature.
",39,138,7,24,Lamey,Friender25017,Friender," We made it, too.
",18,138,7,24,Hermberg,Bender25018,Bender," But my gyroscope's permanently busted.I guess I'll be dizzy and uncoordinated for the rest of my Yeah, it's fixed! My coordination's back, baby.
",146,138,7,24,Friender,All25019,All," Yeah.
",7,138,7,24,Bender,Leela25020,Leela," I've got navigation. We're on our way home.
",45,138,7,24,All,Professor25021,Professor," It just shows how everything is possible when you work together.Speaking of which, I have a surprise announcement.There never was a creature.Surprise.The whole adventure was just a training exercise to teach you the value of teamwork.
",236,138,7,24,Leela,Leela25022,Leela," Huh, I should be mad, but it worked pretty well.
",50,138,7,24,Professor,Amy25023,Amy," You were really brave, Leela.
",31,138,7,24,Leela,Leela25024,Leela," And you seriously nailed that thing with your golf shot.
",58,138,7,24,Amy,Bender25025,Bender," Fry, you saved my ass out there.
",34,138,7,24,Leela,Fry25026,Fry," Aw, I couldn't let anything happen to something that shiny.
",61,138,7,24,Bender,Hermes25027,Hermes," And, Dr.Zoidberg, it was your quick thinking.
",47,138,7,24,Fry,Professor25028,Professor," Bad news, everyone.The creature is a shape-shifter. It knocked me out and took my form so it could prey on poor Hermes.
",121,138,7,24,Hermes,Scruffy25029,Scruffy," I weren't fooled.The real [[Professor[[ wun't never've Dern.
",62,138,7,24,Professor,ProfessorÂ 25030,ProfessorÂ ," Bad news, everyone. The creature is a shape-shifter. It knocked me out and took my form so it could prey on poor Hermes and Scruffy.
",134,138,7,24,Scruffy,Bender25031,Bender," Nice try, buddy.
",18,138,7,24,ProfessorÂ ,Leela25032,Leela," We're not buying it this time.
",32,138,7,24,Bender,Professor25033,Professor," But-but I'm the real Professor. I can prove it. If you'll step up real close to my microscope here, I'll show you that my DNA is completely 
",142,138,7,24,Leela,Fry25034,Fry," Is it safe to come 
",21,138,7,24,Professor,Leela25035,Leela," It's time we solved this problem the old-fashioned way. By shooting it.
",73,138,7,24,Fry,Bender25036,Bender," Wait, wait, wait, wait, you can't give everybody guns.What if one of us is the creature? It could be any of us.Fry.Leela.Amy. Zoidberg. Zoidberg.

",36,138,7,24,Bender,Zoidberg25038,Zoidberg," Is it me maybe? Aw.
",21,138,7,24,Zoidberg,Leela25039,Leela," Quick, in here. We're the only ones left who can trust each other. I know you well enough that no creature could ever fool me. No matter how much it looked like you.
",167,138,7,24,Zoidberg,Fry25040,Fry," Leela, I'm honored, but for your own safety, you shouldn't trust anyone, not even me.
",87,138,7,24,Leela,Leela25041,Leela," But I'm just so scared. Kiss me.
",34,138,7,24,Fry,Fry25042,Fry," Easy, easy, you're biting my lip.
",35,138,7,24,Leela,Leela25043,Leela," Sorry.
",8,138,7,24,Fry,Fry25044,Fry," Ow, ow, ow! Wait a second, I know what's going on here. I'm the monster.
",74,138,7,24,Leela,Amy25045,Amy," The creature was right behind me. I don't know where it went.
",63,138,7,24,Fry,Bender Â 25046,Bender Â ," Just leave me alone. I'm really, really scared.
",49,138,7,24,Amy,Amy25047,Amy," Uh, Bender?
",13,138,7,24,Bender Â ,Bender25048,Bender," What?
",7,138,7,24,Amy,Amy25049,Amy," Where'd you get those ears? 
",30,138,7,24,Bender,Bender Â 25050,Bender Â ," I've always had ears.
",23,138,7,24,Amy,Amy25051,Amy," No, you haven't.
",18,138,7,24,Bender Â ,Bender25052,Bender," All right, fine, you got me. I can't keep track of every little detail.
",73,138,7,24,Amy,Fry25053,Fry," Okay, to see if you're the real Bender, I'm gonna ask you something only he would know. On your last birthday, what gift did I get you? 
",138,138,7,24,Bender,Bender25054,Bender," I don't remember.
",19,138,7,24,Fry,Fry25055,Fry," Me neither.
",13,138,7,24,Bender,Bender25056,Bender," Okay, I'll ask you one. What's the square root of 2,345.4? 
",61,138,7,24,Fry,Fry25057,Fry," That's not something I would know.
",36,138,7,24,Bender,Bender25058,Bender," Oh, yeah. Your turn.
",22,138,7,24,Fry,Fry25059,Fry," Um, what color is my shirt? 
",30,138,7,24,Bender,Bender25060,Bender," If I were the creature, I could just look at your shirt, dum-dum.
",67,138,7,24,Fry,Fry25061,Fry," Good point. 
",14,138,7,24,Bender,Bender25062,Bender," Aw, never mind this. In case I'm about to die, I just want you to know that I did polish my ass with your toothbrush.
",119,138,7,24,Fry,Fry25063,Fry," Thanks for telling me, buddy. And to be honest, I am jealous of how shiny your ass is, and sometimes at night, I unpolish it with sandpaper.
",142,138,7,24,Bender,Bender25064,Bender," Aw, I trust you.
",18,138,7,24,Fry,Fry25065,Fry,"I trust you, too.
",18,138,7,24,Bender,McMasters25066,McMasters," Congratulations. You two have really learned the power of trust.
",66,138,7,24,Fry,Fry25067,Fry," Get away from us, you monster.
",32,138,7,24,McMasters,McMasters25068,McMasters," Don't worry. There isn't really a monster. And no one really got eaten.The whole thing was just part of our team-building experience.And you two did terrific.
",160,138,7,24,Fry,Bender25069,Bender," But-but what about that hitchhiker? 
",38,138,7,24,McMasters,McMasters25070,McMasters," You mean my partner, Blorgulax? He does make a convincing hitchhiker. But he majored in business at Princeton.
",112,138,7,24,Bender,Fry25071,Fry," But we saw him change shape.
",30,138,7,24,McMasters,McMasters25072,McMasters," Yes, he is a shape-shifter.But he uses his shape-shifting for team-building, not evil. He pretends to eat some people. The others have to work together. We hand out a few tote bags. And boom! Four percent increase in productivity minimum.
",240,138,7,24,Fry,Fry25073,Fry," So no one's dead? 
",20,138,7,24,McMasters,McMasters25074,McMasters," Of course not. All your friends are on the bridge having a pizza party. So come on, put the guns down and join us.
",116,138,7,24,Fry,Fry25075,Fry," Ooh. I think it moved.
",24,138,7,24,McMasters,Hermes25076,Hermes," Hey guys, are you coming to the party or not? Where's McMasters? He turned out to be such a nice guy, didn't he? 
",115,138,7,24,Fry,Zoidberg25077,Zoidberg," Totally, we should go on a retreat like this every year.
",58,138,7,24,Hermes,Amy25078,Amy," Yeah! Every year!
",19,138,7,24,Zoidberg,Morbo25079,Morbo," In other news celebrated businessman Dan McMasters was last seen two weeks ago. And authority's are now calling his disappearance a homicide.
",143,138,7,24,Amy,Fry25080,Fry," We can't ever tell anyone what really happened.
",49,138,7,24,Morbo,Bender25081,Bender," Never ever! I can trust you right?
",36,138,7,24,Fry,Fry25082,Fry," Can I trust you?
",18,138,7,24,Bender,Bender25083,Bender," My lips couldn't be more sealed, even if I had lips.
",54,138,7,24,Fry,Linda25084,Linda," Police have no leads, but are offering a one million dollar reward, for information leading to the arrest of the killer.In the event there are two killers, police are offering an unusual deal Total immunity for the one that turns in the other, plus a double reward of two million dollars.
",290,138,7,24,Bender,Zoidberg25085,Zoidberg," Zindy, my darling. I can't believe we're finally going to meet in person!
",75,139,7,25,Linda,Zindy25086,Zindy," It won't be long, Johnny cakes. My space bus gets in at four thirty.
",70,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25087,Zoidberg," Just in time for the ""all you can stand"" buffet at Chizzler!
",62,139,7,25,Zindy,Zindy25088,Zindy," See you soon.
",15,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Fry25089,Fry," Zoidberg. What is that?
",25,139,7,25,Zindy,Zoidberg25090,Zoidberg," That is the delightful creature I've been video-dating for the past four years.
",81,139,7,25,Fry,Bender25091,Bender," Hit it with a stick!
",22,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25092,Zoidberg," Tonight is a dream come true! A real, live date, in a physical place that exists! I just have to go straighten up in case we end up at my place.
",146,139,7,25,Bender,Zoidberg25093,Zoidberg," There! My home's all clean except for one part... the inside.
",63,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Leela25094,Leela," Aw... I'm sure it's fine by the standards of a gross alien monster. Blech!
",76,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25095,Zoidberg," Nope.
",7,139,7,25,Leela,Bender25096,Bender," Step aside, people! I got bug bombs.
",38,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Fry25097,Fry," Bender. Wait. Won't the bugs just run out and infest some place else? Like our building?
",90,139,7,25,Bender,Bender25098,Bender," Not my problem. Fire in the hole!
",35,139,7,25,Fry,Randy25099,Randy," A-mazing! You move... like a young, roach-infested Gene Kelly.
",64,139,7,25,Bender,Leela25100,Leela," Oh, my God. It's Randy!
",25,139,7,25,Randy,Randy25101,Randy," Damn right! And I'm organisin' a tap-dance contest for the parks and rec department. If you don't enter, I'll just kill myself okay?!
",135,139,7,25,Leela,Fry25102,Fry," Okay.
",7,139,7,25,Randy,Bender25103,Bender," No. Wait! Me? El-o Bender? In a dance contest?
",48,139,7,25,Fry,Randy25104,Randy," It's a way for the community toâ€”
",34,139,7,25,Bender,Bender25105,Bender," At last, a chance to realise my brand-new dream of bein' the greatest tap dancer... in all the world!
",103,139,7,25,Randy,Randy25106,Randy," Well... in a three-block radius.
",34,139,7,25,Bender,Bender25107,Bender," Of all time!
",14,139,7,25,Randy,Zoidberg25108,Zoidberg," You-do-do-do. Boy-boy-boy-boy. Greetings, merchant! I need something beautiful and cheap for a lady who is one of those things.
",129,139,7,25,Bender,Merchant25109,Merchant," The cheapest thing I have is a bouquet of daisies, for six dollars.
",69,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25110,Zoidberg," Perfect! I'll take half a bouquet of daisies, for three dollars!
",66,139,7,25,Merchant,Merchant25111,Merchant," These flower sheers are so dull... and I'm already in debt to every knife sharpener in town.
",94,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25112,Zoidberg," Allow... me.
",14,139,7,25,Merchant,Merchant25113,Merchant," Aw! Thank you! That girlfriend of yours is one lucky lady.
",60,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25114,Zoidberg," I'm gonna snip her off her feet!
",34,139,7,25,Merchant,Zoidberg25115,Zoidberg," Zindy! You're even more beautiful from a distance!
",52,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zindy25116,Zindy," Johnny cakes! Good God! What's that horrible stench?!
",55,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25117,Zoidberg," Stench... Er er er... That's probably this stinky bus station, maybe!
Come. Let's go some place well ventilated and grow old together.
",136,139,7,25,Zindy,Zoidberg25118,Zoidberg," Ah! Much better.
",18,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zindy25119,Zindy," It's even worse! It's like Comic-Con in a submarine! Oh... Oh, my God! The smell's coming from you!
",101,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25120,Zoidberg," What? That? That's just my personal musk. You'll learn to love it! I know I did.
",82,139,7,25,Zindy,Zindy25121,Zindy," I'm sorry, Zoidberg. I can't see you anymore. Something's come up.
It's vomit!
",80,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25122,Zoidberg," I'd like to return these for a refund. Don't worry. They're... unused.
",72,139,7,25,Zindy,Merchant25123,Merchant," Oh. I'm sorry. I get so little business I can't afford refunds. I don't know what's wrong with this location.
",111,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25124,Zoidberg," I understand.
",15,139,7,25,Merchant,Merchant25125,Merchant," Please don't cry. I can't stand to see a living thing feel pain. You are a... living thing. Right?
",100,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25126,Zoidberg," Mhm. Can I have a refund now?
",31,139,7,25,Merchant,Roberto25127,Roberto," Ha ha! This here's a bayonet. It's some kinda kooky... half gun... half knife. Now empty out the register! And no bag, please. I care... about the environment.
",161,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Merchant25128,Merchant," I... I have three dollars in mouldy pennies. It's all yours.
",62,139,7,25,Roberto,Roberto25129,Roberto," That's generous of you.
",25,139,7,25,Merchant,Zoidberg25130,Zoidberg," Oh no you don't, Mister Big Jerk! I have nothing to live for, so I don't mind telling you... Those pennies are mine.
",118,139,7,25,Roberto,Roberto25131,Roberto," Don't you get it? I'm craaaaaaazyyyyy! Ha ha!
",47,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25132,Zoidberg," Go ahead! I don't care what happens anymore. Do it! Bash my head in.
",70,139,7,25,Roberto,Roberto25133,Roberto," What is that? Mustard gas? That ain't legal. Ain't you hurtin' no Geneva convention?!
",87,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Merchant25134,Merchant," That was amazing. Aw. You were so brave and frugal...
",55,139,7,25,Roberto,Zoidberg25135,Zoidberg," I'm sorry. Don't hit me. Ooh... I like the way you hit! But I don't get it. Most women I've met can't even stand next to me without collapsing.
",145,139,7,25,Merchant,Merchant25136,Merchant," What's wrong with those women?
",32,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25137,Zoidberg," Well... some of them didn't have legs. But it's not them. It's me. How do I put this delicately? I'm smellier than a whorehouse's outhouse!
",141,139,7,25,Merchant,Merchant25138,Merchant," That's... terribly vivid. Doesn't matter to me, though. I was born with no sense of smell.
",92,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25139,Zoidberg," Really?
",9,139,7,25,Merchant,Merchant25140,Merchant," My name's Marianne.
",21,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25141,Zoidberg," Hello, you!
",13,139,7,25,Merchant,Marianne25142,Marianne," I like your dumpster.
",23,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25143,Zoidberg," Thank you. The previous tenant was a very prominent raccoon!
",62,139,7,25,Marianne,Marianne25144,Marianne," I remember. Too bad he got partially run over by that steamroller. Can I kiss you?
",84,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25145,Zoidberg," First, let me pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming! Ouch! I forgot I was a giant crab!
",94,139,7,25,Marianne,Randy25146,Randy," Welcome, fans! I'm Randy, coordinator of this tap-dance-a-palooza.
",68,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Fry25147,Fry," Woohoo! Ran-dy!
",17,139,7,25,Randy,Randy25148,Randy," After weeks of searching, I'm proud to introduce the five people willing to participate â€” Tonya... Bender... Greg... some kinda blob monster... and Petunia!
",158,139,7,25,Fry,Petunia25149,Petunia," The extra clickin' you'll hear is gonna be my hip.
",52,139,7,25,Randy,Randy25150,Randy," F.Y.I.... this little lady has a heart condition. She's always stealing them! Also... she has a serious heart condition.
",122,139,7,25,Petunia,Tonya25151,Tonya," I'm six years old, and tap dancing is my favourest thing! Even if it's not good for my pacemaker...
",101,139,7,25,Randy,Audience25152,Audience," Aw...
",7,139,7,25,Tonya,Bender25153,Bender," That is one quality pacemaker. The rest of you might as well give up now, 'cuz I'm gonna take home daâ€” Hey. What's my grand prize gonna be?
",141,139,7,25,Audience,Randy25154,Randy," Oh. There is no prize, Dorothy. Unless you count the satisfaction of winning.
",79,139,7,25,Bender,Bender25155,Bender," It... will... be... mine!
",27,139,7,25,Randy,Hermes25156,Hermes," In conclusion, bullying in the workplace in unacceptable... and will not be tolerated.
",88,139,7,25,Bender,Bender25157,Bender," Outta my way, fattie! I'm practisin'. Ta-da!
",46,139,7,25,Hermes,Zoidberg25158,Zoidberg," Friends! I'd like you to meet my new lady â€” Marianne!
",55,139,7,25,Bender,Fry25159,Fry," What's the catch? She looks normal.
",37,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Amy25160,Amy," She's not a hologram.
",23,139,7,25,Fry,Farnsworth25161,Farnsworth," Not a robo-slave.
",19,139,7,25,Amy,Bender25162,Bender," We give up.
",13,139,7,25,Farnsworth,Marianne25163,Marianne," You guys are weird. I have to go open my flower stand, before the falafel guy takes my spot, but it was great to meet you. See ya later... crab cakes!
",152,139,7,25,Bender,Amy25164,Amy," Dr Zoidberg... She's great!
",29,139,7,25,Marianne,Zoidberg25165,Zoidberg," She's the best thing that ever happened to me. We had a wonderful night of love-making in my dumpster.
",104,139,7,25,Amy,Others25166,Others," Ewwwwwww!
",11,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Leela25167,Leela," I hope she used protection.
",29,139,7,25,Others,Fry25168,Fry," Uh... No offense, Zoidberg, but... how is she not driven to madness by your mind-altering stench?
",99,139,7,25,Leela,Zoidberg25169,Zoidberg," Because, my friends... she has no sense of smell!
",51,139,7,25,Fry,Others25170,Others," Ohhhhhhh.
",11,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Bender25171,Bender," That explained this.
",22,139,7,25,Others,Amy25172,Amy," I get it.
",11,139,7,25,Bender,Zoidberg25173,Zoidberg," For the first time in my life, I'm truly happy.
",49,139,7,25,Amy,Hermes25174,Hermes," It's just too bad for her there's no cure, I assume.
",54,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Farnsworth25175,Farnsworth," Ooh... but there is! A skilled surgeon could perform a nose transplant.
",73,139,7,25,Hermes,Zoidberg25176,Zoidberg," You're right! And I, as a renowned ear, nose, and blowhole doctor, could do the operation!
",92,139,7,25,Farnsworth,Fry25177,Fry," Are you nuts?! If she could smell, she'd smell you! Your relationship would be over faster than you can sayâ€”
",110,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Farnsworth25178,Farnsworth," Listen to Orange Joe. You must never let the girl know of this wonderful surgery!
",83,139,7,25,Fry,Zoidberg25179,Zoidberg," I dunno. It doesn't seem fair to Marianne. But on the other claw... maybe I can't live without her! So you're right. I can never tell her.
",140,139,7,25,Farnsworth,Leela25180,Leela," You're doing the right thing.
",31,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Randy25181,Randy," Today the competition begins. Over the course of the summer, we'll be eliminating one contestant each week, and by ""we"" I mean ""me"". Deal with it, you babies! Let the battle begin!
",182,139,7,25,Leela,Randy25182,Randy," Okay! Before those pilates Nazis come goose-stepping in and take the room, here are the finalists for next week's championship! Bender... and Tonya!
",150,139,7,25,Randy,Tonya25183,Tonya," I just wanna have fun, because dancing is fun, and I like dancing!
",68,139,7,25,Randy,Fryand Leela25184,Fryand Leela," Aw...
",7,139,7,25,Tonya,Bender25185,Bender," I'm gonna kick your ass, little girl!
",39,139,7,25,Fryand Leela,Zoidberg25186,Zoidberg," For you, my lovely rugelach.
",30,139,7,25,Bender,Marianne25187,Marianne," Thank you! It's Gardenia imperialis. You can brew it into a tea, if you like severe stomach cramps.
",101,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25188,Zoidberg," Such a smart one! You know everything about flowers!
",54,139,7,25,Marianne,Marianne25189,Marianne," Everything but how they smell... Please. Describe it to me.
",61,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25190,Zoidberg," Uh... It's like summer... with a dab of vanilla and honey... or maybe winter with some gravy on it.
",101,139,7,25,Marianne,Marianne25191,Marianne," I'd give anything to be able to smell a flower like that.
",59,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25192,Zoidberg," Marianne, my love. I've never known anyone who wanted to smell so badly... and there's a way maybe you can.
",109,139,7,25,Marianne,Marianne25193,Marianne," Really?! How?
",15,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25194,Zoidberg," We have in the doctor world something called a nose transplant. I can give you a surgery, and when it's done... you'll be able to smell. Everything.
",150,139,7,25,Marianne,Marianne25195,Marianne," Oh, Zoidberg! I want the biggest nose you can find!
",53,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Fry25196,Fry," Dude! You made the finals! Congrats!
",38,139,7,25,Marianne,Leela25197,Leela," You've accomplished so much more than most of us would bother to.
",67,139,7,25,Fry,Bender25198,Bender," Yeah, but I'm not done yet. I got a full-proof plan to make sure I go home the champ!
",87,139,7,25,Leela,Fry25199,Fry," You're gonna put sequins on your hat?
",39,139,7,25,Bender,Bender25200,Bender," Pfffffff!
See that locker? Tonya keeps her tap shoes in there, so right before she dances... I'll sneak in and put rusty tacks in them.  The harder she dances, the more she bleeds!
",182,139,7,25,Fry,Fry25201,Fry," Seems like a sold plan.
",25,139,7,25,Bender,Leela25202,Leela," What?! It's the most horrifying thing I've ever heard!
",56,139,7,25,Fry,Fry25203,Fry," That's true.
",14,139,7,25,Leela,Bender25204,Bender," Well, it gets worse. Once Tonya drops out due to blood loss, I kidnap her parents and make them watch... while I cut off her hair with these head's clippers!
",159,139,7,25,Fry,Leela25205,Leela," Don't you lay a hand on that angel!
",37,139,7,25,Bender,Bender25206,Bender," Angel?! I've looked into her eyes and seen her soul! She's a monster.
",71,139,7,25,Leela,Leela25207,Leela," You're insane! Come on, Fry. Let's go.
",40,139,7,25,Bender,Fry25208,Fry," Okay.
See ya, Bender.
",23,139,7,25,Leela,Tonya25209,Tonya," The championship's mine, robot.
",33,139,7,25,Fry,Bender25210,Bender," Why? Whyyyyy?! What did I not do yet to deserve this?!
",56,139,7,25,Tonya,Amy25211,Amy," Aw... I think it's noble of you to give Marianne a new nose.
",62,139,7,25,Bender,Hermes25212,Hermes," Yeah. She'll be forever grateful... from somewhere upwind.
",60,139,7,25,Amy,Zoidberg25213,Zoidberg," True. Our relationship will end once she smells my odour. But you know what would really stink? If Marianne spent her whole life never knowing the beautiful scent of her own flowers.
",184,139,7,25,Hermes,Bender25214,Bender," Dr Zoidberg! Help!
",20,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Fry25215,Fry," Bender?! What happened to your leg tube?
",42,139,7,25,Bender,Bender25216,Bender," I got beat up by a little girl. Please. Fix my knee, so I can get revenge at the tap-dance championship!
",106,139,7,25,Fry,Zoidberg25217,Zoidberg," I don't have time for this, robut. Here. Patch yourself up with this medicinal wacky pack.  It's time!
",104,139,7,25,Bender,Leela25218,Leela," I got a donor nose! There was an accident at the fencing academy.
",67,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Fry25219,Fry," TouchÃ©!
",9,139,7,25,Leela,Zoidberg25220,Zoidberg," It'll all be over soon, my love. May I have...  one last kiss?
",64,139,7,25,Fry,Marianne25221,Marianne," Aw. There'll be lots more.
",28,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25222,Zoidberg," Yes. Lots.  Nurse Amy. The anesthesia.
",40,139,7,25,Marianne,Marianne25223,Marianne," Smell you later.
",18,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Amy25224,Amy," She's out.
",12,139,7,25,Marianne,Zoidberg25225,Zoidberg," Then let's begin this delicate procedure.
",43,139,7,25,Amy,Randy25226,Randy," Okay, dance maniacs. Let's have a big hand for our finalists â€” cute, little Tonya... and mean, old what's-his-name!
",117,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Tonya25227,Tonya,"  Break a leg, Bender.  Oops! Looks like you already did!
",58,139,7,25,Randy,Bender25228,Bender," You are an evil, heartless trough... so actually... we have a lot in common. In another life, we could've been friends.
",121,139,7,25,Tonya,Tonya25229,Tonya," No chance, garbage-can face!
",30,139,7,25,Bender,Bender25230,Bender," Aw!
",5,139,7,25,Tonya,Randy25231,Randy," Brace yourselves, 'cuz we're gonna try somethin' you would never see in mainstream tap â€” a simultaneous, head-to-head tap-off!
",128,139,7,25,Bender,Farnsworth25232,Farnsworth," Wha?!
",7,139,7,25,Randy,Mrs. Astor25233,Mrs. Astor," Scandalous!
",13,139,7,25,Farnsworth,Randy25234,Randy," It's time for some fancy, shmancy dancy. Hit it, me!
",54,139,7,25,Mrs. Astor,Bender25235,Bender," Ooooh!
",8,139,7,25,Randy,Fry25236,Fry," Ow! Bender!
",13,139,7,25,Bender,Randy25237,Randy," Ew! Look at him dance! He don't care.
",39,139,7,25,Fry,Tonya25238,Tonya," Try this, pegleg.
",19,139,7,25,Randy,Bender25239,Bender," No sweat!
",11,139,7,25,Tonya,Randy25240,Randy," Time's up, kittens. The judge has conferred and the vote is in. I pick her.
",77,139,7,25,Bender,Tonya25241,Tonya," Thanks, Mister Nice Man. You know... the doctors say my heart doesn't work very good, but it feels good today, 'cuz I got to dance, and make people happy.
",156,139,7,25,Randy,Bender25242,Bender," I never knew I could hate this much!
",38,139,7,25,Tonya,Leela25243,Leela," Bender! She's a sweet little girl!
",36,139,7,25,Bender,Bender25244,Bender," She's a pig! I'm gonna tap-dance on her grave some day!
",57,139,7,25,Leela,Leela25245,Leela," Ohhhhh!
",9,139,7,25,Bender,Tonya25246,Tonya," This... is the bestestest day of my wholeâ€” Gah!
",49,139,7,25,Leela,Randy25247,Randy," Oh, my God, people! She's having a heart attack! A cute little heart attack!
",78,139,7,25,Tonya,Dr Cahill25248,Dr Cahill," I'm a doctor, and yes. They're real. Clear!
",45,139,7,25,Randy,Marianne25249,Marianne," How did it go?
",16,139,7,25,Dr Cahill,Zoidberg25250,Zoidberg," Just perfect. This time, you can describe their beautiful aroma to me.
",72,139,7,25,Marianne,Marianne25251,Marianne," What is that horrible stench?
",31,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25252,Zoidberg," I don't know how to tell you this, but...
",43,139,7,25,Marianne,Marianne25253,Marianne," It's these flowers! Bluh-ah!
",30,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25254,Zoidberg," It's not the flowers. It'sâ€”
",29,139,7,25,Marianne,Marianne25255,Marianne," Much better. You smell just like I dreamed you would.
",55,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25256,Zoidberg," But but... But but... most people think I smell like a burning zoo!
",69,139,7,25,Marianne,Marianne25257,Marianne," I never learned a good smell from a bad smell, but I like the way you smell... because I like you.
",100,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Amy25258,Amy," It's so beautiful!
",20,139,7,25,Marianne,Dr Cahill25259,Dr Cahill," I'm sorry. She's gone.
",24,139,7,25,Amy,Bender25260,Bender," Woohoo! In your dead face, little girl! I'm not even gonna wait to dance on your grave. I'm gonna dance on your corpse, right now.
",132,139,7,25,Dr Cahill,Randy25261,Randy," Oh, my God!
",13,139,7,25,Bender,Fry25262,Fry," No, Bender! What're you doin'?! No!
",37,139,7,25,Randy,Leela25263,Leela," Bender! Stop!
",15,139,7,25,Fry,Randy25264,Randy," The robot has to go!
",22,139,7,25,Leela,Bender25265,Bender," Huh?! What's that?
",20,139,7,25,Randy,Tonya25266,Tonya," I took a nappie!
",18,139,7,25,Bender,Dr Cahill25267,Dr Cahill," I don't believe it. She's alive! Bender's rhythmic chest compressions restarted her heart.
",92,139,7,25,Tonya,Randy25268,Randy," He's a big ol' hero!
",22,139,7,25,Dr Cahill,Bender25269,Bender," No. I was... tryin'... Hey. Wait. I... Come on. What...
",57,139,7,25,Randy,Tonya25270,Tonya," Just 'cuz you saved my life doesn't mean I won't beat you down again.
",71,139,7,25,Bender,Bender25271,Bender," Man. You are irredeemably evil. Together, we shall rule the galaxy!
",69,139,7,25,Tonya,Hattie McDoogal25272,Hattie McDoogal," Aw... What an adorable, little kajigger.
",42,139,7,25,Bender,Bender25273,Bender," Now!
",6,139,7,25,Hattie McDoogal,Zoidberg25274,Zoidberg," Ah. Nothing like the first cup of dumpster juice in the morning. Marianne?!
",77,139,7,25,Bender,Marianne25275,Marianne," Yes.
Listen. I've got a new job, and... well... I'm going to have to dump you.
",80,139,7,25,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25276,Zoidberg," I'd like that!
",16,139,7,25,Marianne,Bender25277,Bender," 
",2,140,7,26,Zoidberg,Fry25278,Fry," Remember this place, Leela?
",29,140,7,26,Bender,Leela25279,Leela," Yep. The moon. It's been here for quite a while.
",50,140,7,26,Fry,Fry25280,Fry," Yeah, but it's also where we came on our very first delivery together.
",72,140,7,26,Leela,Leela25281,Leela," Oh, right. Man, we sure used to try harder back then.
",55,140,7,26,Fry,Craterface25282,Craterface," Get your likeness in the form of a balloon sculpture! A cherished family keepsake for hours to come!
",102,140,7,26,Leela,Fry25283,Fry," One Leela, please. And use your finest balloons.
",50,140,7,26,Craterface,Leela25284,Leela," Wow! You're good!
",19,140,7,26,Fry,Craterface25285,Craterface," Five years of art school. 
",28,140,7,26,Leela,Bender25286,Bender," Want a corndog?
",17,140,7,26,Craterface,Albert25287,Albert," Sure!
",7,140,7,26,Bender,Bender25288,Bender," Then your mom shoulda bought you one! 
",40,140,7,26,Albert,Carnie25289,Carnie," Hold tight! The Mecha-Hexadecapus is about to flail erratically into action!
",78,140,7,26,Bender,Bender25290,Bender,"  Y'know, I'm feelin' a little... BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGGGHHH... BLLLEEEEEEEEEEGGGGGGHHH....... BLLEEEEEEEEGGGGH....
",115,140,7,26,Carnie,Leela25291,Leela," AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!
",34,140,7,26,Bender,Fry25292,Fry," LEELA!!!
",10,140,7,26,Leela,Fry25293,Fry," Poor Leela! I never even told her I loved her!
",48,140,7,26,Fry,Bender25294,Bender," What?! You told her like 140 times!!
",38,140,7,26,Fry,Fry25295,Fry," Yeah, but she paid very little attention to me. Oh, Bender, I always thought me and her would...grow old together.
",116,140,7,26,Bender,Bender25296,Bender,"  You gotta live in the moment, baby! And this moment, Leela's dead.
",69,140,7,26,Fry,Moon Patrolman #125297,Moon Patrolman #1," Sir, we have some good news and some bad news. The good news is we found your stuffed animal.
",95,140,7,26,Bender,Fry25298,Fry," What's the bad news?
",22,140,7,26,Moon Patrolman #1,Moon Patrolman #125299,Moon Patrolman #1," Your wife is dead.
",20,140,7,26,Fry,Fry25300,Fry," She wasn't my wife!
",21,140,7,26,Moon Patrolman #1,Moon Patrolman #125301,Moon Patrolman #1," Oh. Then there is no bad news.
",32,140,7,26,Fry,Fry25302,Fry," Leela! You're alive!!
",23,140,7,26,Moon Patrolman #1,Leela25303,Leela," She gave her life to save mine!
",33,140,7,26,Fry,Fry25304,Fry," Bender, can I come in and talk?
",33,140,7,26,Leela,Bender25305,Bender," I'm kinda busy!
",17,140,7,26,Fry,Fry25306,Fry," Seeing Leela fly off the Hexadecapus and crash through the moon dome and survive inside a stuffed animal by breathing a balloon was a dose of reality.
",152,140,7,26,Bender,Bender25307,Bender,"  Come in!
",11,140,7,26,Fry,Fry25308,Fry," All this time, I've been wondering if I can spend my life with her, but what I realize now is I can't spend my life without her! So tomorrow, I'm asking her to marry me!
",171,140,7,26,Bender,Bender25309,Bender," Uh-huh. Good talk. We're done here.  My little meatbag's growin' up!
",70,140,7,26,Fry,Hermes25310,Hermes," Computer, Jamaican joy juice! Hot!
",36,140,7,26,Bender,Farnsworth25311,Farnsworth," GN, E!  Behold, the time button! A pocket-sized device that sends the entire universe 10 seconds into the past! I will now demonstrate.
",137,140,7,26,Hermes,Hermes25312,Hermes," ...joy juice! Hot!
",20,140,7,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth25313,Farnsworth," Pretty cool, eh? I'm over here, where I was 10 seconds ago!
",61,140,7,26,Hermes,Amy25314,Amy," Something's cool? Show it to us!
",34,140,7,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth25315,Farnsworth," Eh, wha? Oh, right! You were outside the button ball, so you don't remember a thing I said. Let's try again. But this time, everyone cram into my time shelter.
",161,140,7,26,Amy,Bender25316,Bender," Oooh!
",7,140,7,26,Farnsworth,Fry25317,Fry," Whoa!
",7,140,7,26,Bender,Leela25318,Leela," Nice!
",7,140,7,26,Fry,Farnsworth25319,Farnsworth," It's coated with anti-chroniton-resistant grout, to shield you from the effects of the button. Come on! Get in! Hurry up!
",123,140,7,26,Leela,Zoidberg25320,Zoidberg," Friends, I found a ten dollars!
",33,140,7,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth25321,Farnsworth," Ten dollars, you say? Let me see.
",35,140,7,26,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25322,Zoidberg," It fell off a man. The man got into a taxi. But the money did not.  Friends, I found a ten dollars!
",101,140,7,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth25323,Farnsworth," You found some money? Show me!
",32,140,7,26,Zoidberg,Zoidberg25324,Zoidberg," Awwww...
",10,140,7,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth25325,Farnsworth," Say, check out the money I found! It fell off a chump! 
",57,140,7,26,Zoidberg,Leela25326,Leela," Hey, Professor, couldn't you go back in time as far as you want by pressing the button over and over?
",103,140,7,26,Farnsworth,Farnsworth25327,Farnsworth," Certainly not! Each time the button sends you back 10 seconds, it takes 10 seconds to recharge!  There. It's recharged.
",121,140,7,26,Leela,Zoidberg25328,Zoidberg," Awwww...
",10,140,7,26,Farnsworth,Bender25329,Bender," Again! Again!
",15,140,7,26,Zoidberg,Fry25330,Fry," Uh, question. What if you had a special moment that you wish could go on forever? Could the time button make it last as long as you wanted?
",141,140,7,26,Bender,Farnsworth25331,Farnsworth," Hell no! This button is for scientific use only!
",50,140,7,26,Fry,Zoidberg25332,Zoidberg," Awwww...
",10,140,7,26,Farnsworth,Fry25333,Fry," Uh, yes, I'd like an engagement diamond, please.
",50,140,7,26,Zoidberg,Ultra Guy25334,Ultra Guy," You've come to the right joint, Ace!
",38,140,7,26,Fry,Fry25335,Fry," I'll take...this one.
",23,140,7,26,Ultra Guy,Ultra Guy25336,Ultra Guy," Classy choice, chief! She'll crap her pants!  That'll be five bills.  Hey, gimme back my stones!
",98,140,7,26,Fry,Fry25337,Fry," Hello, stranger! This is my first time here! Do you sell diamonds?
",68,140,7,26,Ultra Guy,Ultra Guy25338,Ultra Guy," You've come to the right joint, Ace!
",38,140,7,26,Fry,Fry25339,Fry," I guess what I'm saying is, the next time you almost die, I want it to be as my wife!  The clam, Elzar.
",105,140,7,26,Ultra Guy,Elzar25340,Elzar," Clam, bam, thank you, ma'am!
",30,140,7,26,Fry,Leela25341,Leela," Fry?  Wow!
